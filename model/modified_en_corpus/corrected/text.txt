0014-208-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MORROW BROUGHT A VERY SOBER LOOKING MORNING THE SUN MAKING ONLY A FEW EFFORTS TO APPEAR AND CATHERINE AUGURED FROM IT EVERYTHING MOST FAVOURABLE TO HER WISHES
0014-208-0001 DECLINED GIVING ANY ABSOLUTE PROMISE OF SUNSHINE SHE APPLIED TO MISSUS ALLEN AND MISSUS ALLEN'S OPINION WAS MORE POSITIVE SHE HAD NO DOUBT IN THE WORLD OF ITS BEING A VERY FINE DAY IF THE CLOUDS WOULD ONLY GO OFF AND THE SUN KEEP OUT
0014-208-0002 AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK HOWEVER A FEW SPECKS OF SMALL RAIN UPON THE WINDOWS CAUGHT CATHERINE'S WATCHFUL EYE AND OH DEAR I DO BELIEVE IT WILL BE WET BROKE FROM HER IN A MOST DESPONDING TONE
0014-208-0003 I THOUGHT HOW IT WOULD BE SAID MISSUS ALLEN NO WALK FOR ME TODAY SIGHED CATHERINE BUT PERHAPS IT MAY COME TO NOTHING OR IT MAY HOLD UP BEFORE TWELVE PERHAPS IT MAY BUT THEN MY DEAR
0014-208-0004 IT WILL BE SO DIRTY OH THAT WILL NOT SIGNIFY I NEVER MIND DIRT NO REPLIED HER FRIEND VERY PLACIDLY I KNOW YOU NEVER MIND DIRT AFTER A SHORT PAUSE
0014-208-0005 IT COMES ON FASTER AND FASTER SAID CATHERINE AS SHE STOOD WATCHING AT A WINDOW SO IT DOES INDEED IF IT KEEPS RAINING THE STREETS WILL BE VERY WET THERE ARE FOUR UMBRELLAS UP ALREADY HOW I HATE THE SIGHT OF AN UMBRELLA
0014-208-0006 THERE WILL BE VERY FEW PEOPLE IN THE PUMP ROOM IF IT RAINS ALL THE MORNING I HOPE MISTER ALLEN WILL PUT ON HIS GREATCOAT WHEN HE GOES BUT I DARE SAY HE WILL NOT FOR HE HAD RATHER DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD THAN WALK OUT IN A GREATCOAT I WONDER HE SHOULD DISLIKE IT IT MUST BE SO COMFORTABLE
0014-208-0007 THE RAIN CONTINUED FAST THOUGH NOT HEAVY CATHERINE WENT EVERY FIVE MINUTES TO THE CLOCK THREATENING ON EACH RETURN THAT IF IT STILL KEPT ON RAINING ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES SHE WOULD GIVE UP THE MATTER AS HOPELESS
0014-208-0008 THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE AND IT STILL RAINED YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO MY DEAR I DO NOT QUITE DESPAIR YET I SHALL NOT GIVE IT UP TILL A QUARTER AFTER TWELVE
0014-208-0009 THIS IS JUST THE TIME OF DAY FOR IT TO CLEAR UP AND I DO THINK IT LOOKS A LITTLE LIGHTER THERE IT IS TWENTY MINUTES AFTER TWELVE AND NOW I SHALL GIVE IT UP ENTIRELY OH THAT WE HAD SUCH WEATHER HERE AS THEY HAD AT UDOLPHO
0014-208-0010 OR AT LEAST IN TUSCANY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE THE NIGHT THAT POOR SAINT AUBIN DIED SUCH BEAUTIFUL WEATHER AT HALF PAST TWELVE WHEN CATHERINE'S ANXIOUS ATTENTION TO THE WEATHER WAS OVER AND SHE COULD NO LONGER CLAIM ANY MERIT FROM ITS AMENDMENT
0014-208-0011 THAT A BRIGHT AFTERNOON WOULD SUCCEED AND JUSTIFIED THE OPINION OF MISSUS ALLEN WHO HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD CLEAR UP BUT WHETHER CATHERINE MIGHT STILL EXPECT HER FRIENDS WHETHER THERE HAD NOT BEEN TOO MUCH RAIN FOR MISS TILNEY TO VENTURE MUST YET BE A QUESTION
0014-208-0012 IT WAS TOO DIRTY FOR MISSUS ALLEN TO ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND TO THE PUMP ROOM HE ACCORDINGLY SET OFF BY HIMSELF AND CATHERINE HAD BARELY WATCHED HIM DOWN THE STREET WHEN HER NOTICE WAS CLAIMED BY THE APPROACH OF THE SAME TWO OPEN CARRIAGES
0014-208-0013 CONTAINING THE SAME THREE PEOPLE THAT HAD SURPRISED HER SO MUCH A FEW MORNINGS BACK ISABELLA MY BROTHER AND MISTER THORPE I DECLARE THEY ARE COMING FOR ME PERHAPS BUT I SHALL NOT GO I CANNOT GO INDEED
0014-208-0014 FOR YOU KNOW MISS TILNEY MAY STILL CALL MISSUS ALLEN AGREED TO IT JOHN THORPE WAS SOON WITH THEM AND HIS VOICE WAS WITH THEM YET SOONER FOR ON THE STAIRS HE WAS CALLING OUT TO MISS MORLAND TO BE QUICK MAKE HASTE MAKE HASTE AS HE THREW OPEN THE DOOR
0014-208-0015 THIS WAS OF COURSE VEHEMENTLY TALKED DOWN AS NO REASON AT ALL MISSUS ALLEN WAS CALLED ON TO SECOND HIM AND THE TWO OTHERS WALKED IN TO GIVE THEIR ASSISTANCE MY SWEETEST CATHERINE IS NOT THIS DELIGHTFUL WE SHALL HAVE A MOST HEAVENLY DRIVE
0014-208-0016 YOU ARE TO THANK YOUR BROTHER AND ME FOR THE SCHEME IT DARTED INTO OUR HEADS AT BREAKFAST TIME I VERILY BELIEVE AT THE SAME INSTANT AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OFF TWO HOURS AGO IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THIS DETESTABLE RAIN BUT IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY THE NIGHTS ARE MOONLIGHT AND WE SHALL DO DELIGHTFULLY
0014-208-0017 OH I AM IN SUCH ECSTASIES AT THE THOUGHTS OF A LITTLE COUNTRY AIR AND QUIET SO MUCH BETTER THAN GOING TO THE LOWER ROOMS WE SHALL DRIVE DIRECTLY TO CLIFTON AND DINE THERE
0014-208-0018 I DOUBT OUR BEING ABLE TO DO SO MUCH SAID MORLAND YOU CROAKING FELLOW CRIED THORPE WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DO TEN TIMES MORE KINGSWESTON AYE AND BLAIZE CASTLE TOO AND ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN HEAR OF
0014-208-0019 BUT HERE IS YOUR SISTER SAYS SHE WILL NOT GO BLAIZE CASTLE CRIED CATHERINE WHAT IS THAT THE FINEST PLACE IN ENGLAND WORTH GOING FIFTY MILES AT ANY TIME TO SEE
0014-208-0020 WHAT IS IT REALLY A CASTLE AN OLD CASTLE THE OLDEST IN THE KINGDOM
0014-208-0021 THEY PROMISED TO COME AT TWELVE ONLY IT RAINED BUT NOW AS IT IS SO FINE I DARE SAY THEY WILL BE HERE SOON NOT THEY INDEED CRIED THORPE FOR AS WE TURNED INTO BROAD STREET I SAW THEM DOES HE NOT DRIVE A PHAETON WITH BRIGHT CHESTNUTS
0014-208-0022 I DO NOT KNOW INDEED YES I KNOW HE DOES I SAW HIM YOU ARE TALKING OF THE MAN YOU DANCED WITH LAST NIGHT ARE NOT YOU YES WELL I SAW HIM AT THAT MOMENT TURN UP THE LANSDOWN ROAD DRIVING A SMART LOOKING GIRL
0014-208-0023 IT IS VERY ODD BUT I SUPPOSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TOO DIRTY FOR A WALK AND WELL THEY MIGHT FOR I NEVER SAW SO MUCH DIRT IN MY LIFE WALK YOU COULD NO MORE WALK THAN YOU COULD FLY IT HAS NOT BEEN SO DIRTY THE WHOLE WINTER IT IS ANKLE DEEP EVERYWHERE
0014-208-0024 ISABELLA CORROBORATED IT MY DEAREST CATHERINE YOU CANNOT FORM AN IDEA OF THE DIRT COME YOU MUST GO YOU CANNOT REFUSE GOING NOW I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CASTLE BUT MAY WE GO ALL OVER IT
0014-208-0025 MAY WE GO UP EVERY STAIRCASE AND INTO EVERY SUITE OF ROOMS YES YES EVERY HOLE AND CORNER BUT THEN IF THEY SHOULD ONLY BE GONE OUT FOR AN HOUR TILL IT IS DRYER AND CALL BY AND BY
0014-208-0026 MAKE YOURSELF EASY THERE IS NO DANGER OF THAT FOR I HEARD TILNEY HALLOOING TO A MAN WHO WAS JUST PASSING BY ON HORSEBACK THAT THEY WERE GOING AS FAR AS WICK ROCKS THEN I WILL SHALL I GO MISSUS ALLEN
0014-208-0027 AND IN TWO MINUTES THEY WERE OFF CATHERINE'S FEELINGS AS SHE GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE
0014-208-0028 DIVIDED BETWEEN REGRET FOR THE LOSS OF ONE GREAT PLEASURE AND THE HOPE OF SOON ENJOYING ANOTHER ALMOST ITS EQUAL IN DEGREE HOWEVER UNLIKE IN KIND SHE COULD NOT THINK THE TILNEYS HAD ACTED QUITE WELL BY HER
0014-208-0029 IN SO READILY GIVING UP THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITHOUT SENDING HER ANY MESSAGE OF EXCUSE IT WAS NOW BUT AN HOUR LATER THAN THE TIME FIXED ON FOR THE BEGINNING OF THEIR WALK AND IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD HEARD OF THE PRODIGIOUS ACCUMULATION OF DIRT IN THE COURSE OF THAT HOUR
0014-208-0030 AS HER FANCY REPRESENTED BLAIZE CASTLE TO BE WAS SUCH A COUNTERPOISE OF GOOD AS MIGHT CONSOLE HER FOR ALMOST ANYTHING THEY PASSED BRISKLY DOWN PULTENEY STREET AND THROUGH LAURA PLACE WITHOUT THE EXCHANGE OF MANY WORDS
0014-208-0031 THORPE TALKED TO HIS HORSE AND SHE MEDITATED BY TURNS ON BROKEN PROMISES AND BROKEN ARCHES PHAETONS AND FALSE HANGINGS TILNEYS AND TRAP DOORS AS THEY ENTERED ARGYLE BUILDINGS HOWEVER SHE WAS ROUSED BY THIS ADDRESS FROM HER COMPANION
0014-208-0032 WHO IS THAT GIRL WHO LOOKED AT YOU SO HARD AS SHE WENT BY WHO WHERE ON THE RIGHT HAND PAVEMENT SHE MUST BE ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT NOW CATHERINE LOOKED ROUND AND SAW MISS TILNEY LEANING ON HER BROTHER'S ARM
0014-208-0033 BUT TO WHAT PURPOSE DID SHE SPEAK THORPE ONLY LASHED HIS HORSE INTO A BRISKER TROT THE TILNEYS WHO HAD SOON CEASED TO LOOK AFTER HER WERE IN A MOMENT OUT OF SIGHT ROUND THE CORNER OF LAURA PLACE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS HERSELF WHISKED INTO THE MARKETPLACE
0014-208-0034 STILL HOWEVER AND DURING THE LENGTH OF ANOTHER STREET SHE ENTREATED HIM TO STOP PRAY PRAY STOP MISTER THORPE I CANNOT GO ON I WILL NOT GO ON I MUST GO BACK TO MISS TILNEY BUT MISTER THORPE ONLY LAUGHED SMACKED HIS WHIP
0014-208-0035 ENCOURAGED HIS HORSE MADE ODD NOISES AND DROVE ON AND CATHERINE ANGRY AND VEXED AS SHE WAS HAVING NO POWER OF GETTING AWAY WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE POINT AND SUBMIT HER REPROACHES HOWEVER WERE NOT SPARED
0014-208-0036 HOW COULD YOU DECEIVE ME SO MISTER THORPE HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT YOU SAW THEM DRIVING UP THE LANSDOWN ROAD I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD IT HAPPEN SO FOR THE WORLD THEY MUST THINK IT SO STRANGE SO RUDE OF ME TO GO BY THEM TOO WITHOUT SAYING A WORD
0014-208-0037 YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW VEXED I AM I SHALL HAVE NO PLEASURE AT CLIFTON NOR IN ANYTHING ELSE I HAD RATHER TEN THOUSAND TIMES RATHER GET OUT NOW AND WALK BACK TO THEM HOW COULD YOU SAY YOU SAW THEM DRIVING OUT IN A PHAETON THORPE DEFENDED HIMSELF VERY STOUTLY
0014-208-0038 DECLARED HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO MEN SO MUCH ALIKE IN HIS LIFE AND WOULD HARDLY GIVE UP THE POINT OF ITS HAVING BEEN TILNEY HIMSELF THEIR DRIVE EVEN WHEN THIS SUBJECT WAS OVER WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE VERY AGREEABLE
0014-208-0039 CATHERINE'S COMPLAISANCE WAS NO LONGER WHAT IT HAD BEEN IN THEIR FORMER AIRING SHE LISTENED RELUCTANTLY AND HER REPLIES WERE SHORT BLAIZE CASTLE REMAINED HER ONLY COMFORT TOWARDS THAT SHE STILL LOOKED AT INTERVALS WITH PLEASURE
0014-208-0040 THOUGH RATHER THAN BE DISAPPOINTED OF THE PROMISED WALK AND ESPECIALLY RATHER THAN BE THOUGHT ILL OF BY THE TILNEYS SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE GIVEN UP ALL THE HAPPINESS WHICH ITS WALLS COULD SUPPLY THE HAPPINESS OF A PROGRESS THROUGH A LONG SUITE OF LOFTY ROOMS
0014-208-0041 EXHIBITING THE REMAINS OF MAGNIFICENT FURNITURE THOUGH NOW FOR MANY YEARS DESERTED THE HAPPINESS OF BEING STOPPED IN THEIR WAY ALONG NARROW WINDING VAULTS BY A LOW GRATED DOOR
0014-208-0042 OR EVEN OF HAVING THEIR LAMP THEIR ONLY LAMP EXTINGUISHED BY A SUDDEN GUST OF WIND AND OF BEING LEFT IN TOTAL DARKNESS IN THE MEANWHILE THEY PROCEEDED ON THEIR JOURNEY WITHOUT ANY MISCHANCE AND WERE WITHIN VIEW OF THE TOWN OF KEYNSHAM
0014-208-0043 MADE HIS FRIEND PULL UP TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER THE OTHERS THEN CAME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR CONVERSATION AND MORLAND SAID WE HAD BETTER GO BACK THORPE IT IS TOO LATE TO GO ON TODAY
0014-208-0044 IT IS ALL ONE TO ME REPLIED THORPE RATHER ANGRILY AND INSTANTLY TURNING HIS HORSE THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY BACK TO BATH
0014-208-0045 SAID HE SOON AFTERWARDS WE MIGHT HAVE DONE IT VERY WELL
0014-208-0046 AND I HAVE ALMOST BROKE MY ARM WITH PULLING HIM IN TO THAT CURSED BROKEN WINDED JADE'S PACE MORLAND IS A FOOL FOR NOT KEEPING A HORSE AND GIG OF HIS OWN NO HE IS NOT SAID CATHERINE WARMLY
0014-208-0047 AND THAT IF PEOPLE WHO ROLLED IN MONEY COULD NOT AFFORD THINGS HE DID NOT KNOW WHO COULD WHICH CATHERINE DID NOT EVEN ENDEAVOUR TO UNDERSTAND DISAPPOINTED OF WHAT WAS TO HAVE BEEN THE CONSOLATION FOR HER FIRST DISAPPOINTMENT
0014-208-0048 SHE WAS LESS AND LESS DISPOSED EITHER TO BE AGREEABLE HERSELF OR TO FIND HER COMPANION SO AND THEY RETURNED TO PULTENEY STREET WITHOUT HER SPEAKING TWENTY WORDS AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE THE FOOTMAN TOLD HER THAT A GENTLEMAN AND LADY HAD CALLED
0014-208-0049 AND INQUIRED FOR HER A FEW MINUTES AFTER HER SETTING OFF THAT WHEN HE TOLD THEM SHE WAS GONE OUT WITH MISTER THORPE THE LADY HAD ASKED WHETHER ANY MESSAGE HAD BEEN LEFT FOR HER AND ON HIS SAYING NO HAD FELT FOR A CARD BUT SAID SHE HAD NONE ABOUT HER AND WENT AWAY
0014-208-0050 PONDERING OVER THESE HEART RENDING TIDINGS CATHERINE WALKED SLOWLY UPSTAIRS AT THE HEAD OF THEM SHE WAS MET BY MISTER ALLEN WHO ON HEARING THE REASON OF THEIR SPEEDY RETURN
0014-208-0051 A VERY GOOD EQUIVALENT FOR THE QUIET AND COUNTRY AIR OF AN INN AT CLIFTON HER SATISFACTION TOO IN NOT BEING AT THE LOWER ROOMS WAS SPOKEN MORE THAN ONCE HOW I PITY THE POOR CREATURES THAT ARE GOING THERE
0014-208-0052 I DARE SAY IT WILL NOT BE A VERY GOOD BALL I KNOW THE MITCHELLS WILL NOT BE THERE I AM SURE I PITY EVERYBODY THAT IS BUT I DARE SAY MISTER MORLAND YOU LONG TO BE AT IT DO NOT YOU I AM SURE YOU DO
0014-208-0053 WELL PRAY DO NOT LET ANYBODY HERE BE A RESTRAINT ON YOU I DARE SAY WE COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT YOU BUT YOU MEN THINK YOURSELVES OF SUCH CONSEQUENCE CATHERINE COULD ALMOST HAVE ACCUSED ISABELLA OF BEING WANTING IN TENDERNESS TOWARDS HERSELF AND HER SORROWS
0014-208-0055 BUT THE TILNEYS WERE ENTIRELY TO BLAME WHY WERE NOT THEY MORE PUNCTUAL IT WAS DIRTY INDEED BUT WHAT DID THAT SIGNIFY I AM SURE JOHN AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE MINDED IT I NEVER MIND GOING THROUGH ANYTHING WHERE A FRIEND IS CONCERNED THAT IS MY DISPOSITION
0014-208-0056 AND NOW I MAY DISMISS MY HEROINE TO THE SLEEPLESS COUCH WHICH IS THE TRUE HEROINE'S PORTION TO A PILLOW STREWED WITH THORNS AND WET WITH TEARS
0014-212-0000 THE TWO YOUNGEST MISS THORPES WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE PARLOUR AND ON ANNE'S QUITTING IT TO CALL HER SISTER CATHERINE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING THE OTHER FOR SOME PARTICULARS OF THEIR YESTERDAY'S PARTY
0014-212-0001 THAT NOBODY COULD IMAGINE HOW CHARMING IT HAD BEEN AND THAT IT HAD BEEN MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN ANYBODY COULD CONCEIVE SUCH WAS THE INFORMATION OF THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES THE SECOND UNFOLDED THUS MUCH IN DETAIL
0014-212-0002 AND HURRYING BACK TO THE HOTEL SWALLOWED THEIR DINNER IN HASTE TO PREVENT BEING IN THE DARK AND THEN HAD A DELIGHTFUL DRIVE BACK ONLY THE MOON WAS NOT UP AND IT RAINED A LITTLE AND MISTER MORLAND'S HORSE WAS SO TIRED HE COULD HARDLY GET IT ALONG
0014-212-0003 MARIA'S INTELLIGENCE CONCLUDED WITH A TENDER EFFUSION OF PITY FOR HER SISTER ANNE
0014-212-0004 SHE WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME I AM SURE BUT YOU KNOW HOW COULD I HELP IT JOHN WOULD HAVE ME GO FOR HE VOWED HE WOULD NOT DRIVE HER BECAUSE SHE HAD SUCH THICK ANKLES I DARE SAY SHE WILL NOT BE IN GOOD HUMOUR AGAIN THIS MONTH
0014-212-0005 BUT I AM DETERMINED I WILL NOT BE CROSS IT IS NOT A LITTLE MATTER THAT PUTS ME OUT OF TEMPER ISABELLA NOW ENTERED THE ROOM WITH SO EAGER A STEP AND A LOOK OF SUCH HAPPY IMPORTANCE AS ENGAGED ALL HER FRIEND'S NOTICE
0014-212-0006 AND SO YOU GUESSED IT THE MOMENT YOU HAD MY NOTE SLY CREATURE OH MY DEAR CATHERINE YOU ALONE WHO KNOW MY HEART CAN JUDGE OF MY PRESENT HAPPINESS YOUR BROTHER IS THE MOST CHARMING OF MEN I ONLY WISH I WERE MORE WORTHY OF HIM
0014-212-0007 BUT WHAT WILL YOUR EXCELLENT FATHER AND MOTHER SAY OH HEAVENS WHEN I THINK OF THEM I AM SO AGITATED CATHERINE'S UNDERSTANDING BEGAN TO AWAKE AN IDEA OF THE TRUTH SUDDENLY DARTED INTO HER MIND AND
0014-212-0008 WITH THE NATURAL BLUSH OF SO NEW AN EMOTION SHE CRIED OUT GOOD HEAVEN MY DEAR ISABELLA WHAT DO YOU MEAN CAN YOU CAN YOU REALLY BE IN LOVE WITH JAMES THIS BOLD SURMISE HOWEVER SHE SOON LEARNT COMPREHENDED BUT HALF THE FACT
0014-212-0009 THE ANXIOUS AFFECTION WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING CONTINUALLY WATCHED IN ISABELLA'S EVERY LOOK AND ACTION HAD IN THE COURSE OF THEIR YESTERDAY'S PARTY RECEIVED THE DELIGHTFUL CONFESSION OF AN EQUAL LOVE HER HEART AND FAITH WERE ALIKE ENGAGED TO JAMES
0014-212-0010 OF WHICH THE ORDINARY COURSE OF LIFE CAN HARDLY AFFORD A RETURN THE STRENGTH OF HER FEELINGS SHE COULD NOT EXPRESS THE NATURE OF THEM HOWEVER CONTENTED HER FRIEND THE HAPPINESS OF HAVING SUCH A SISTER WAS THEIR FIRST EFFUSION
0014-212-0011 YOU WILL BE SO INFINITELY DEARER TO ME MY CATHERINE THAN EITHER ANNE OR MARIA I FEEL THAT I SHALL BE SO MUCH MORE ATTACHED TO MY DEAR MORLAND'S FAMILY THAN TO MY OWN THIS WAS A PITCH OF FRIENDSHIP BEYOND CATHERINE
0014-212-0012 THAT I QUITE DOTED ON YOU THE FIRST MOMENT I SAW YOU BUT SO IT ALWAYS IS WITH ME THE FIRST MOMENT SETTLES EVERYTHING THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT MORLAND CAME TO US LAST CHRISTMAS THE VERY FIRST MOMENT I BEHELD HIM MY HEART WAS IRRECOVERABLY GONE
0014-212-0013 I REMEMBER I WORE MY YELLOW GOWN WITH MY HAIR DONE UP IN BRAIDS AND WHEN I CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND JOHN INTRODUCED HIM I THOUGHT I NEVER SAW ANYBODY SO HANDSOME BEFORE HERE
0014-212-0014 I KNOW BUT I WILL NOT PAIN YOU BY DESCRIBING MY ANXIETY YOU HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF IT I FEEL THAT I HAVE BETRAYED MYSELF PERPETUALLY SO UNGUARDED IN SPEAKING OF MY PARTIALITY FOR THE CHURCH BUT MY SECRET I WAS ALWAYS SURE WOULD BE SAFE WITH YOU
0014-212-0015 CATHERINE FELT THAT NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN SAFER BUT ASHAMED OF AN IGNORANCE LITTLE EXPECTED SHE DARED NO LONGER CONTEST THE POINT NOR REFUSE TO HAVE BEEN AS FULL OF ARCH PENETRATION AND AFFECTIONATE SYMPATHY AS ISABELLA CHOSE TO CONSIDER HER
0014-212-0016 HER BROTHER SHE FOUND WAS PREPARING TO SET OFF WITH ALL SPEED TO FULLERTON TO MAKE KNOWN HIS SITUATION AND ASK CONSENT AND HERE WAS A SOURCE OF SOME REAL AGITATION TO THE MIND OF ISABELLA CATHERINE ENDEAVOURED TO PERSUADE HER AS SHE WAS HERSELF PERSUADED THAT
0014-212-0017 THEY NEVER CAN CONSENT TO IT YOUR BROTHER WHO MIGHT MARRY ANYBODY HERE CATHERINE AGAIN DISCERNED THE FORCE OF LOVE INDEED ISABELLA YOU ARE TOO HUMBLE THE DIFFERENCE OF FORTUNE CAN BE NOTHING TO SIGNIFY OH
0014-212-0018 MY SWEET CATHERINE IN YOUR GENEROUS HEART I KNOW IT WOULD SIGNIFY NOTHING BUT WE MUST NOT EXPECT SUCH DISINTERESTEDNESS IN MANY AS FOR MYSELF I AM SURE I ONLY WISH OUR SITUATIONS WERE REVERSED HAD I THE COMMAND OF MILLIONS WERE I MISTRESS OF THE WHOLE WORLD YOUR BROTHER WOULD
0014-212-0019 BE MY ONLY CHOICE THIS CHARMING SENTIMENT RECOMMENDED AS MUCH BY SENSE AS NOVELTY GAVE CATHERINE A MOST PLEASING REMEMBRANCE OF ALL THE HEROINES OF HER ACQUAINTANCE AND SHE THOUGHT HER FRIEND NEVER LOOKED MORE LOVELY THAN IN UTTERING THE GRAND IDEA
0014-212-0020 I AM SURE THEY WILL CONSENT WAS HER FREQUENT DECLARATION I AM SURE THEY WILL BE DELIGHTED WITH YOU FOR MY OWN PART SAID ISABELLA MY WISHES ARE SO MODERATE THAT THE SMALLEST INCOME IN NATURE WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME
0014-212-0021 IF I CAN BUT BE NEAR YOU I SHALL BE SATISFIED BUT THIS IS IDLE TALKING I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO THINK OF SUCH THINGS TILL WE HAVE YOUR FATHER'S ANSWER MORLAND SAYS THAT BY SENDING IT TONIGHT TO SALISBURY WE MAY HAVE IT TOMORROW TOMORROW
0014-212-0022 A REVERIE SUCCEEDED THIS CONVICTION AND WHEN ISABELLA SPOKE AGAIN IT WAS TO RESOLVE ON THE QUALITY OF HER WEDDING GOWN THEIR CONFERENCE WAS PUT AN END TO BY THE ANXIOUS YOUNG LOVER HIMSELF WHO CAME TO BREATHE HIS PARTING SIGH BEFORE HE SET OFF FOR WILTSHIRE
0014-212-0023 BUT KNEW NOT WHAT TO SAY AND HER ELOQUENCE WAS ONLY IN HER EYES FROM THEM HOWEVER THE EIGHT PARTS OF SPEECH SHONE OUT MOST EXPRESSIVELY
0014-212-0024 IMPATIENT FOR THE REALIZATION OF ALL THAT HE HOPED AT HOME
0014-212-0025 TWICE WAS HE CALLED ALMOST FROM THE DOOR BY HER EAGERNESS TO HAVE HIM GONE INDEED MORLAND I MUST DRIVE YOU AWAY CONSIDER HOW FAR YOU HAVE TO RIDE I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU LINGER SO FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE WASTE NO MORE TIME
0014-212-0026 THERE GO GO I INSIST ON IT THE TWO FRIENDS WITH HEARTS NOW MORE UNITED THAN EVER WERE INSEPARABLE FOR THE DAY AND IN SCHEMES OF SISTERLY HAPPINESS THE HOURS FLEW ALONG MISSUS THORPE AND HER SON
0014-212-0027 TO FILL UP THE MEASURE OF CURIOSITY
0014-212-0028 TO CATHERINE'S SIMPLE FEELINGS THIS ODD SORT OF RESERVE SEEMED NEITHER KINDLY MEANT NOR CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED AND ITS UNKINDNESS SHE WOULD HARDLY HAVE FORBORNE POINTING OUT HAD ITS INCONSISTENCY BEEN LESS THEIR FRIEND
0014-212-0029 BEFORE THE DELIVERY OF THE LETTERS A NEEDFUL EXERTION FOR AS THE TIME OF REASONABLE EXPECTATION DREW NEAR ISABELLA BECAME MORE AND MORE DESPONDING AND BEFORE THE LETTER ARRIVED HAD WORKED HERSELF INTO A STATE OF REAL DISTRESS
0014-212-0030 BUT WHEN IT DID COME WHERE COULD DISTRESS BE FOUND I HAVE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN GAINING THE CONSENT OF MY KIND PARENTS AND AM PROMISED THAT EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER SHALL BE DONE TO FORWARD MY HAPPINESS WERE THE FIRST THREE LINES
0014-212-0031 AND IN ONE MOMENT ALL WAS JOYFUL SECURITY THE BRIGHTEST GLOW WAS INSTANTLY SPREAD OVER ISABELLA'S FEATURES ALL CARE AND ANXIETY SEEMED REMOVED HER SPIRITS BECAME ALMOST TOO HIGH FOR CONTROL AND SHE CALLED HERSELF WITHOUT SCRUPLE
0014-212-0032 THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS MISSUS THORPE WITH TEARS OF JOY EMBRACED HER DAUGHTER HER SON HER VISITOR AND COULD HAVE EMBRACED HALF THE INHABITANTS OF BATH WITH SATISFACTION
0014-212-0033 HER HEART WAS OVERFLOWING WITH TENDERNESS IT WAS DEAR JOHN AND DEAR CATHERINE AT EVERY WORD DEAR ANNE AND DEAR MARIA MUST IMMEDIATELY BE MADE SHARERS IN THEIR FELICITY AND TWO DEARS AT ONCE BEFORE THE NAME OF ISABELLA
0014-212-0034 WERE NOT MORE THAN THAT BELOVED CHILD HAD NOW WELL EARNED JOHN HIMSELF WAS NO SKULKER IN JOY
0014-212-0035 BUT SWORE OFF MANY SENTENCES IN HIS PRAISE THE LETTER WHENCE SPRANG ALL THIS FELICITY WAS SHORT CONTAINING LITTLE MORE THAN THIS ASSURANCE OF SUCCESS AND EVERY PARTICULAR WAS DEFERRED TILL JAMES COULD WRITE AGAIN
0014-212-0036 BUT FOR PARTICULARS ISABELLA COULD WELL AFFORD TO WAIT THE NEEDFUL WAS COMPRISED IN MISTER MORLAND'S PROMISE HIS HONOUR WAS PLEDGED TO MAKE EVERYTHING EASY AND BY WHAT MEANS THEIR INCOME WAS TO BE FORMED WHETHER LANDED PROPERTY WERE TO BE RESIGNED
0014-212-0037 OR FUNDED MONEY MADE OVER WAS A MATTER IN WHICH HER DISINTERESTED SPIRIT TOOK NO CONCERN SHE KNEW ENOUGH TO FEEL SECURE OF AN HONOURABLE AND SPEEDY ESTABLISHMENT AND HER IMAGINATION TOOK A RAPID FLIGHT OVER ITS ATTENDANT FELICITIES
0014-212-0038 SHE SAW HERSELF AT THE END OF A FEW WEEKS THE GAZE AND ADMIRATION OF EVERY NEW ACQUAINTANCE AT FULLERTON THE ENVY OF EVERY VALUED OLD FRIEND IN PUTNEY WITH A CARRIAGE AT HER COMMAND A NEW NAME ON HER TICKETS
0014-212-0039 AND A BRILLIANT EXHIBITION OF HOOP RINGS ON HER FINGER WHEN THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER WERE ASCERTAINED JOHN THORPE WHO HAD ONLY WAITED ITS ARRIVAL TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TO LONDON PREPARED TO SET OFF WELL MISS MORLAND
0014-212-0040 I AM COME TO BID YOU GOOD BYE CATHERINE WISHED HIM A GOOD JOURNEY WITHOUT APPEARING TO HEAR HER HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW FIDGETED ABOUT HUMMED A TUNE AND SEEMED WHOLLY SELF OCCUPIED
0014-212-0041 DO YOU THAT'S HONEST BY HEAVENS I AM GLAD YOU ARE NO ENEMY TO MATRIMONY HOWEVER DID YOU EVER HEAR THE OLD SONG GOING TO ONE WEDDING BRINGS ON ANOTHER
0014-212-0042 I DINE WITH MISS TILNEY TODAY AND MUST NOW BE GOING HOME NAY BUT THERE IS NO SUCH CONFOUNDED HURRY WHO KNOWS WHEN WE MAY BE TOGETHER AGAIN NOT BUT THAT I SHALL BE DOWN AGAIN BY THE END OF A FORTNIGHT
0014-212-0043 AND IT IS NOT ONLY GOOD NATURE BUT YOU HAVE SO MUCH SO MUCH OF EVERYTHING AND THEN YOU HAVE SUCH UPON MY SOUL I DO NOT KNOW ANYBODY LIKE YOU OH
0014-212-0044 THERE ARE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE LIKE ME I DARE SAY ONLY A GREAT DEAL BETTER GOOD MORNING TO YOU BUT I SAY MISS MORLAND I SHALL COME AND PAY MY RESPECTS AT FULLERTON BEFORE IT IS LONG IF NOT DISAGREEABLE PRAY DO
0014-212-0045 MY FATHER AND MOTHER WILL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AND I HOPE I HOPE MISS MORLAND YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY TO SEE ME OH DEAR NOT AT ALL
0014-212-0046 BUT I HAVE A NOTION MISS MORLAND YOU AND I THINK PRETTY MUCH ALIKE UPON MOST MATTERS PERHAPS WE MAY
0014-212-0047 THERE ARE NOT MANY THAT I KNOW MY OWN MIND ABOUT BY JOVE NO MORE DO I
0014-212-0048 MY NOTION OF THINGS IS SIMPLE ENOUGH LET ME ONLY HAVE THE GIRL I LIKE SAY I WITH A COMFORTABLE HOUSE OVER MY HEAD AND WHAT CARE I FOR ALL THE REST FORTUNE IS NOTHING I AM SURE OF A GOOD INCOME OF MY OWN
0014-212-0049 AND IF SHE HAD NOT A PENNY WHY SO MUCH THE BETTER VERY TRUE I THINK LIKE YOU THERE IF THERE IS A GOOD FORTUNE ON ONE SIDE THERE CAN BE NO OCCASION FOR ANY ON THE OTHER NO MATTER WHICH HAS IT SO THAT THERE IS ENOUGH
0014-212-0050 I HATE THE IDEA OF ONE GREAT FORTUNE LOOKING OUT FOR ANOTHER AND TO MARRY FOR MONEY I THINK THE WICKEDEST THING IN EXISTENCE GOOD DAY
0014-212-0051 AND AWAY SHE WENT IT WAS NOT IN THE POWER OF ALL HIS GALLANTRY TO DETAIN HER LONGER WITH SUCH NEWS TO COMMUNICATE AND SUCH A VISIT TO PREPARE FOR HER DEPARTURE WAS NOT TO BE DELAYED BY ANYTHING IN HIS NATURE TO URGE AND SHE HURRIED AWAY
0014-212-0052 IN MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN BY THE COMMUNICATION OF THE WONDERFUL EVENT HOW GREAT WAS HER DISAPPOINTMENT THE IMPORTANT AFFAIR WHICH MANY WORDS OF PREPARATION USHERED IN HAD BEEN FORESEEN BY THEM BOTH EVER SINCE HER BROTHER'S ARRIVAL
0014-212-0053 AND ALL THAT THEY FELT ON THE OCCASION WAS COMPREHENDED IN A WISH FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS WITH A REMARK ON THE GENTLEMAN'S SIDE IN FAVOUR OF ISABELLA'S BEAUTY
0014-212-0054 IT WAS TO CATHERINE THE MOST SURPRISING INSENSIBILITY THE DISCLOSURE HOWEVER OF THE GREAT SECRET OF JAMES'S GOING TO FULLERTON THE DAY BEFORE DID RAISE SOME EMOTION IN MISSUS ALLEN SHE COULD NOT LISTEN TO THAT WITH PERFECT CALMNESS
0016-122827-0000 FINALLY THE MORNING DAWNED PEARLY AND LUSTROUS IN A SKY FULL OF SILVER SHEEN AND RADIANCE AND THE WONDERFUL DAY HAD ARRIVED DIANA APPEARED SOON AFTER BREAKFAST WITH A BASKET OF FLOWERS OVER ONE ARM AND HER MUSLIN DRESS OVER THE OTHER
0016-122827-0001 FOR IT WOULD NOT DO TO DON IT UNTIL ALL THE DINNER PREPARATIONS WERE COMPLETED MEANWHILE SHE WORE HER AFTERNOON PINK PRINT AND A LAWN APRON FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY RUFFLED AND FRILLED AND VERY NEAT AND PRETTY AND ROSY SHE WAS

0016-122827-0003 WELL LET'S FORGET OUR TROUBLES AND THINK OF OUR MERCIES SAID ANNE GAILY MISSUS ALLAN SAYS THAT WHENEVER WE THINK OF ANYTHING THAT IS A TRIAL TO US WE SHOULD ALSO THINK OF SOMETHING NICE THAT WE CAN SET OVER AGAINST IT IF YOU ARE SLIGHTLY TOO PLUMP

0016-122827-0006 SO WE'LL HAVE DINNER AT ONE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN TWO HAPPIER AND MORE EXCITED GIRLS SOMEWHERE IN CANADA OR THE UNITED STATES AT THAT MOMENT BUT I DOUBT IT EVERY SNIP OF THE SCISSORS AS ROSE AND PEONY AND BLUEBELL FELL
0016-122827-0007 MISSUS MORGAN IS COMING TODAY ANNE WONDERED HOW MISTER HARRISON COULD GO ON PLACIDLY MOWING HAY IN THE FIELD ACROSS THE LANE JUST AS IF NOTHING WERE GOING TO HAPPEN THE PARLOR AT GREEN GABLES WAS A RATHER SEVERE AND GLOOMY APARTMENT
0016-122827-0008 EXCEPT AT SUCH TIMES AS THEY CLUNG TO UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE'S BUTTONS EVEN ANNE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO INFUSE MUCH GRACE INTO IT FOR MARILLA WOULD NOT PERMIT ANY ALTERATIONS BUT IT IS WONDERFUL WHAT FLOWERS CAN ACCOMPLISH IF YOU GIVE THEM A FAIR CHANCE
0016-122827-0009 WHEN ANNE AND DIANA FINISHED WITH THE ROOM YOU WOULD NOT HAVE RECOGNIZED IT A GREAT BLUE BOWLFUL OF SNOWBALLS OVERFLOWED ON THE POLISHED TABLE THE SHINING BLACK MANTELPIECE WAS HEAPED WITH ROSES AND FERNS EVERY SHELF OF THE WHAT NOT
0016-122827-0010 HELD A SHEAF OF BLUEBELLS THE DARK CORNERS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE GRATE WERE LIGHTED UP WITH JARS FULL OF GLOWING CRIMSON PEONIES AND THE GRATE ITSELF WAS AFLAME WITH YELLOW POPPIES
0016-122827-0011 MADE OF THE USUALLY DISMAL LITTLE ROOM
0016-122827-0012 AND EVEN EXTORTED A TRIBUTE OF ADMIRATION FROM MARILLA WHO CAME IN TO CRITICIZE AND REMAINED TO PRAISE NOW WE MUST SET THE TABLE SAID ANNE IN THE TONE OF A PRIESTESS ABOUT TO PERFORM SOME SACRED RITE IN HONOR OF A DIVINITY
0016-122827-0013 WE'LL HAVE A BIG VASEFUL OF WILD ROSES IN THE CENTER AND ONE SINGLE ROSE IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY'S PLATE AND A SPECIAL BOUQUET OF ROSEBUDS ONLY BY MISSUS MORGAN'S AN ALLUSION TO THE ROSEBUD GARDEN YOU KNOW
0016-122827-0014 THE TABLE WAS SET IN THE SITTING ROOM WITH MARILLA'S FINEST LINEN AND THE BEST CHINA GLASS AND SILVER YOU MAY BE PERFECTLY CERTAIN THAT EVERY ARTICLE PLACED ON IT WAS POLISHED OR SCOURED TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE PERFECTION OF GLOSS AND GLITTER
0016-122827-0015 WHERE THE CHICKENS WERE ALREADY SIZZLING SPLENDIDLY ANNE PREPARED THE POTATOES AND DIANA GOT THE PEAS AND BEANS READY THEN WHILE DIANA SHUT HERSELF INTO THE PANTRY TO COMPOUND THE LETTUCE SALAD ANNE WHOSE CHEEKS WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO GLOW CRIMSON
0016-122827-0016 NOBODY OBJECTED TO THIS AT HALF PAST ELEVEN THE LETTUCE SALAD WAS MADE THE GOLDEN CIRCLES OF THE PIES WERE HEAPED WITH WHIPPED CREAM AND EVERYTHING WAS SIZZLING AND BUBBLING THAT OUGHT TO SIZZLE AND BUBBLE WE'D BETTER GO AND DRESS NOW SAID ANNE FOR THEY MAY BE HERE BY TWELVE
0016-122827-0017 THANKS EITHER TO THE LEMON JUICE OR TO THE UNUSUAL FLUSH ON HER CHEEKS WHEN THEY WERE READY THEY LOOKED QUITE AS SWEET AND TRIM AND GIRLISH AS EVER DID ANY OF MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES I DO HOPE I'LL BE ABLE TO SAY SOMETHING ONCE IN A WHILE
0016-122827-0018 AND NOT SIT LIKE A MUTE SAID DIANA ANXIOUSLY ALL MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES CONVERSE SO BEAUTIFULLY BUT I'M AFRAID I'LL BE TONGUE TIED AND STUPID AND I'LL BE SURE TO SAY I SEEN I HAVEN'T OFTEN SAID IT SINCE MISS STACY TAUGHT HERE
0016-122827-0019 BUT IN MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT IT'S SURE TO POP OUT ANNE IF I WERE TO SAY I SEEN BEFORE MISSUS MORGAN I'D DIE OF MORTIFICATION AND IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD TO HAVE NOTHING TO SAY I'M NERVOUS ABOUT A GOOD MANY THINGS SAID ANNE
0016-122827-0020 BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH FEAR THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO TALK AND TO DO HER JUSTICE THERE WASN'T ANNE SHROUDED HER MUSLIN GLORIES IN A BIG APRON AND WENT DOWN TO CONCOCT HER SOUP MARILLA HAD DRESSED HERSELF AND THE TWINS
0016-122827-0021 AND LOOKED MORE EXCITED THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN TO LOOK BEFORE AT HALF PAST TWELVE THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY CAME EVERYTHING WAS GOING WELL BUT ANNE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL NERVOUS IT WAS SURELY TIME FOR PRISCILLA AND MISSUS MORGAN TO ARRIVE
0016-122827-0022 SHE MADE FREQUENT TRIPS TO THE GATE AND LOOKED AS ANXIOUSLY DOWN THE LANE AS EVER HER NAMESAKE IN THE BLUEBEARD STORY PEERED FROM THE TOWER CASEMENT SUPPOSE THEY DON'T COME AT ALL SHE SAID PITEOUSLY DON'T SUPPOSE IT
0016-122827-0023 SAID DIANA WHO HOWEVER WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE UNCOMFORTABLE MISGIVINGS ON THE SUBJECT ANNE SAID MARILLA COMING OUT FROM THE PARLOR
0016-122827-0024 SHE HAD IN ACCORDANCE WITH HER PROMISE TO MISSUS LYNDE WRITTEN TO MISS BARRY OF CHARLOTTETOWN ASKING FOR THE LOAN OF IT MISS BARRY WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF ANNE'S AND SHE PROMPTLY SENT THE PLATTER OUT WITH A LETTER EXHORTING ANNE TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF IT
0016-122827-0025 FOR SHE HAD PAID TWENTY DOLLARS FOR IT THE PLATTER HAD SERVED ITS PURPOSE AT THE AID BAZAAR AND HAD THEN BEEN RETURNED TO THE GREEN GABLES CLOSET FOR ANNE WOULD NOT TRUST ANYBODY BUT HERSELF TO TAKE IT BACK TO TOWN
0016-122827-0026 SHE CARRIED THE PLATTER CAREFULLY TO THE FRONT DOOR WHERE HER GUESTS WERE ENJOYING THE COOL BREEZE THAT BLEW UP FROM THE BROOK IT WAS EXAMINED AND ADMIRED THEN JUST AS ANNE HAD TAKEN IT BACK INTO HER OWN HANDS A TERRIFIC CRASH AND CLATTER SOUNDED FROM THE KITCHEN PANTRY
0016-122827-0027 MARILLA DIANA AND ANNE FLED OUT THE LATTER PAUSING ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO SET THE PRECIOUS PLATTER HASTILY DOWN ON THE SECOND STEP OF THE STAIRS WHEN THEY REACHED THE PANTRY A TRULY HARROWING SPECTACLE MET THEIR EYES
0016-122827-0028 WHERE HE ALREADY KEPT A SCORE OR SO OF SIMILAR BALLS WHICH SO FAR AS COULD BE DISCOVERED
0016-122827-0029 DAVY HAD TO CLIMB ON THE TABLE AND REACH OVER TO THE SHELF AT A DANGEROUS ANGLE SOMETHING HE HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN BY MARILLA TO DO AS HE HAD COME TO GRIEF ONCE BEFORE IN THE EXPERIMENT THE RESULT IN THIS INSTANCE WAS DISASTROUS
0016-122827-0030 DAVY SLIPPED AND CAME SPRAWLING SQUARELY DOWN ON THE LEMON PIES HIS CLEAN BLOUSE WAS RUINED FOR THAT TIME AND THE PIES FOR ALL TIME IT IS HOWEVER AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NOBODY GOOD
0016-122827-0031 SAID MARILLA PUSHING HIM TOWARD THE HALL WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR DESSERT ASKED ANNE LOOKING REGRETFULLY AT THE WRECK AND RUIN GET OUT A CROCK OF STRAWBERRY PRESERVES SAID MARILLA CONSOLINGLY
0016-122827-0032 BUT COULDN'T BE DEPENDED ON TO REMAIN SO FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE COMING AFTER ALL SAID MARILLA CROSSLY ANNE AND DIANA SOUGHT COMFORT IN EACH OTHER'S EYES AT HALF PAST ONE MARILLA AGAIN EMERGED FROM THE PARLOR
0016-122827-0033 GIRLS WE MUST HAVE DINNER EVERYBODY IS HUNGRY AND IT'S NO USE WAITING ANY LONGER PRISCILLA AND MISSUS MORGAN ARE NOT COMING THAT'S PLAIN AND NOTHING IS BEING IMPROVED BY WAITING ANNE AND DIANA SET ABOUT LIFTING THE DINNER
0016-122827-0034 WITH ALL THE ZEST GONE OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE I DON'T BELIEVE I'LL BE ABLE TO EAT A MOUTHFUL SAID DIANA DOLEFULLY NOR I
0016-122827-0035 I PUT A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR IN WE ALWAYS DO DON'T YOU LIKE IT
0016-122827-0036 SAID MARILLA WHO HAD LISTENED TO THIS DIALOGUE WITH A RATHER GUILTY EXPRESSION I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D REMEMBER ABOUT THE SUGAR ANNE FOR I'M PERFECTLY CERTAIN YOU NEVER DID BEFORE SO I PUT IN A SPOONFUL
0016-122827-0037 LET'S CARRY THE THINGS IN AND GET IT OVER IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THAT DINNER WAS A NOTABLE SUCCESS SOCIALLY THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY EXERTED THEMSELVES TO SAVE THE SITUATION AND MARILLA'S CUSTOMARY PLACIDITY WAS NOT NOTICEABLY RUFFLED
0016-122827-0038 BUT ANNE AND DIANA BETWEEN THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT AND THE REACTION FROM THEIR EXCITEMENT OF THE FORENOON COULD NEITHER TALK NOR EAT ANNE TRIED HEROICALLY TO BEAR HER PART IN THE CONVERSATION FOR THE SAKE OF HER GUESTS BUT ALL THE SPARKLE HAD BEEN QUENCHED IN HER FOR THE TIME BEING
0016-122827-0039 AND IN SPITE OF HER LOVE FOR THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY SHE COULDN'T HELP THINKING HOW NICE IT WOULD BE WHEN EVERYBODY HAD GONE HOME AND SHE COULD BURY HER WEARINESS AND DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE PILLOWS OF THE EAST GABLE THERE IS AN OLD PROVERB THAT REALLY SEEMS AT TIMES TO BE INSPIRED
0016-122827-0040 IT NEVER RAINS BUT IT POURS THE MEASURE OF THAT DAY'S TRIBULATIONS WAS NOT YET FULL JUST AS MISTER ALLAN HAD FINISHED RETURNING THANKS THERE AROSE A STRANGE OMINOUS SOUND ON THE STAIRS AS OF SOME HARD HEAVY OBJECT BOUNDING FROM STEP TO STEP
0016-122827-0041 FINISHING UP WITH A GRAND SMASH AT THE BOTTOM EVERYBODY RAN OUT INTO THE HALL
0016-122827-0042 I SET THAT PLATTER THERE AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT I AM PROPERLY PUNISHED FOR MY CARELESSNESS BUT OH WHAT WILL MISS BARRY SAY WELL YOU KNOW SHE ONLY BOUGHT IT SO IT ISN'T THE SAME AS IF IT WAS AN HEIRLOOM
0016-122827-0043 SAID DIANA TRYING TO CONSOLE THE GUESTS WENT AWAY SOON AFTER FEELING THAT IT WAS THE MOST TACTFUL THING TO DO AND ANNE AND DIANA WASHED THE DISHES TALKING LESS THAN THEY HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN TO DO BEFORE THEN DIANA WENT HOME WITH A HEADACHE
0016-122827-0044 AND OH ANNE DEAR
0016-122827-0045 FOR BY THE TIME AUNTY'S ANKLE IS WELL SHE WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO TORONTO SHE HAS TO BE THERE BY A CERTAIN DATE WELL SIGHED ANNE
0016-122827-0046 WHILE THE TWILIGHT RAINED DOWN OUT OF A DAPPLED SKY I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THAT MISSUS MORGAN SHOULD REALLY COME BUT THERE THAT SPEECH SOUNDS AS PESSIMISTIC AS MISS ELIZA ANDREWS AND I'M ASHAMED OF MAKING IT
0016-122827-0047 AFTER ALL IT WAS NOT TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THINGS JUST AS GOOD AND FAR BETTER ARE COMING TRUE FOR ME ALL THE TIME AND I SUPPOSE THE EVENTS OF TODAY HAVE A FUNNY SIDE TOO PERHAPS WHEN DIANA AND I ARE OLD AND GRAY WE SHALL BE ABLE TO LAUGH OVER THEM
0016-122827-0049 IT SEEMS TO ME ANNE THAT YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO OUTGROW YOUR FASHION OF SETTING YOUR HEART SO ON THINGS AND THEN CRASHING DOWN INTO DESPAIR BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET THEM I KNOW I'M TOO MUCH INCLINED THAT WAY AGREED ANNE RUEFULLY
0016-122827-0050 I THINK IT ALMOST PAYS FOR THE THUD WELL MAYBE IT DOES ADMITTED MARILLA I'D RATHER WALK CALMLY ALONG AND DO WITHOUT BOTH FLYING AND THUD BUT EVERYBODY HAS HER OWN WAY OF LIVING I USED TO THINK THERE WAS ONLY ONE RIGHT WAY
0016-122827-0051 BUT SINCE I'VE HAD YOU AND THE TWINS TO BRING UP I DON'T FEEL SO SURE OF IT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MISS BARRY'S PLATTER PAY HER BACK THE TWENTY DOLLARS SHE PAID FOR IT I SUPPOSE I'M SO THANKFUL IT WASN'T A CHERISHED HEIRLOOM BECAUSE THEN NO MONEY COULD REPLACE IT
0016-122827-0052 MAYBE YOU COULD FIND ONE LIKE IT SOMEWHERE AND BUY IT FOR HER I'M AFRAID NOT PLATTERS AS OLD AS THAT ARE VERY SCARCE MISSUS LYNDE COULDN'T FIND ONE ANYWHERE FOR THE SUPPER I ONLY WISH I COULD FOR OF COURSE MISS BARRY WOULD JUST AS SOON HAVE ONE PLATTER AS ANOTHER
0016-122827-0053 IF BOTH WERE EQUALLY OLD AND GENUINE MARILLA LOOK AT THAT BIG STAR OVER MISTER HARRISON'S MAPLE GROVE WITH ALL THAT HOLY HUSH OF SILVERY SKY ABOUT IT IT GIVES ME A FEELING THAT IS LIKE A PRAYER AFTER ALL WHEN ONE CAN SEE STARS AND SKIES LIKE THAT
0016-122827-0054 WHERE'S DAVY SAID MARILLA WITH AN INDIFFERENT GLANCE AT THE STAR IN BED
0016-122827-0055 OF COURSE THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WAS THAT HE MUST BE GOOD BUT HE TRIED TO BE GOOD AND I HADN'T THE HEART TO DISAPPOINT HIM YOU'LL DROWN YOURSELF OR THE TWINS ROWING ABOUT THE POND IN THAT FLAT GRUMBLED MARILLA
0016-122827-0056 I'VE LIVED HERE FOR SIXTY YEARS AND I'VE NEVER BEEN ON THE POND YET WELL IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND SAID ANNE ROGUISHLY SUPPOSE YOU COME WITH US TOMORROW WE'LL SHUT GREEN GABLES UP AND SPEND THE WHOLE DAY AT THE SHORE DAFFING THE WORLD ASIDE
0016-122827-0057 DO YOU SUPPOSE THERE IS ANY TRUTH IN THE GOSSIP THAT MISTER HARRISON IS GOING TO SEE ISABELLA ANDREWS NO I'M SURE THERE ISN'T HE JUST CALLED THERE ONE EVENING ON BUSINESS WITH MISTER HARMON ANDREWS AND MISSUS LYNDE SAW HIM AND SAID SHE KNEW HE WAS COURTING BECAUSE HE HAD A WHITE COLLAR ON
0016-122827-0058 I DON'T BELIEVE MISTER HARRISON WILL EVER MARRY HE SEEMS TO HAVE A PREJUDICE AGAINST MARRIAGE WELL YOU CAN NEVER TELL ABOUT THOSE OLD BACHELORS AND IF HE HAD A WHITE COLLAR ON I'D AGREE WITH RACHEL THAT IT LOOKS SUSPICIOUS
0016-122827-0059 I THINK HE ONLY PUT IT ON BECAUSE HE WANTED TO CONCLUDE A BUSINESS DEAL WITH HARMON ANDREWS SAID ANNE I'VE HEARD HIM SAY THAT'S THE ONLY TIME A MAN NEEDS TO BE PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE BECAUSE IF HE LOOKS PROSPEROUS THE PARTY OF THE SECOND PART WON'T BE SO LIKELY TO TRY TO CHEAT HIM
0016-122827-0060 I REALLY FEEL SORRY FOR MISTER HARRISON
0016-122828-0000 SHE TURNED HER HEAD AT DAVY'S QUESTION AND ANSWERED DREAMILY OVER THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON DOWN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW PAUL IRVING WOULD HAVE KNOWN THE MEANING OF THIS OR MADE A MEANING OUT OF IT FOR HIMSELF IF HE DIDN'T
0016-122828-0001 BUT PRACTICAL DAVY WHO AS ANNE OFTEN DESPAIRINGLY REMARKED HADN'T A PARTICLE OF IMAGINATION WAS ONLY PUZZLED AND DISGUSTED
0016-122828-0002 BELIEVE YOU'RE JUST TALKING NONSENSE
0016-122828-0003 FOR HAD SHE NOT IN KEEN REMEMBRANCE OF MANY SIMILAR SNUBS ADMINISTERED IN HER OWN EARLY YEARS SOLEMNLY VOWED THAT SHE WOULD NEVER TELL ANY CHILD IT WAS TOO LITTLE TO UNDERSTAND YET HERE SHE WAS DOING IT
0016-122828-0004 IF YOU MEAN ECONOMICAL IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING FROM BEING STINGY IT IS AN EXCELLENT TRAIT IN A PERSON IF SHE IS ECONOMICAL IF MARILLA HAD BEEN STINGY SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN YOU AND DORA WHEN YOUR MOTHER DIED
0016-122828-0005 DAVY WAS EMPHATIC ON THAT POINT NOR I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT TO UNCLE RICHARD NEITHER I'D FAR RATHER LIVE HERE EVEN IF MARILLA IS THAT LONG TAILED WORD WHEN IT COMES TO JAM CAUSE YOU'RE HERE ANNE
0016-122828-0006 THEY'RE ALL RIGHT FOR GIRLS I S'POSE BUT I WANT SOMETHING EXCITING LOTS OF KILLING AND SHOOTING IN IT
0016-122828-0007 FORTUNATELY FOR ANNE MARILLA CALLED OUT AT THIS MOMENT FROM HER ROOM ANNE DIANA'S SIGNALING AT A GREAT RATE YOU'D BETTER SEE WHAT SHE WANTS ANNE RAN TO THE EAST GABLE
0016-122828-0008 AND SAW FLASHES OF LIGHT COMING THROUGH THE TWILIGHT FROM DIANA'S WINDOW IN GROUPS OF FIVE WHICH MEANT ACCORDING TO THEIR OLD CHILDISH CODE COME OVER AT ONCE FOR I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO REVEAL ANNE THREW HER WHITE SHAWL OVER HER HEAD
0016-122828-0009 AND I SAW MARY SENTNER FROM SPENCER VALE IN MISTER BLAIR'S STORE SHE SAYS THE OLD COPP GIRLS ON THE TORY ROAD HAVE A WILLOW WARE PLATTER AND SHE THINKS IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE WE HAD AT THE SUPPER SHE SAYS THEY'LL LIKELY SELL IT
0016-122828-0010 FOR MARTHA COPP HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO KEEP ANYTHING SHE COULD SELL BUT IF THEY WON'T THERE'S A PLATTER AT WESLEY KEYSON'S AT SPENCERVALE AND SHE KNOWS THEY'D SELL IT BUT SHE ISN'T SURE IT'S JUST THE SAME KIND AS AUNT JOSEPHINE'S
0016-122828-0011 I'LL GO RIGHT OVER TO SPENCERVALE AFTER IT TOMORROW SAID ANNE RESOLUTELY AND YOU MUST COME WITH ME IT WILL BE SUCH A WEIGHT OFF MY MIND FOR I HAVE TO GO TO TOWN DAY AFTER TOMORROW AND HOW CAN I FACE YOUR AUNT JOSEPHINE WITHOUT A WILLOW WARE PLATTER
0016-122828-0012 IT WOULD BE EVEN WORSE THAN THE TIME I HAD TO CONFESS ABOUT JUMPING ON THE SPARE ROOM BED BOTH GIRLS LAUGHED OVER THE OLD MEMORY CONCERNING WHICH IF ANY OF MY READERS ARE IGNORANT AND CURIOUS I MUST REFER THEM TO ANNE'S EARLIER HISTORY
0016-122828-0013 THE NEXT AFTERNOON THE GIRLS FARED FORTH ON THEIR PLATTER HUNTING EXPEDITION IT WAS TEN MILES TO SPENCERVALE AND THE DAY WAS NOT ESPECIALLY PLEASANT FOR TRAVELING IT WAS VERY WARM AND WINDLESS
0016-122828-0014 AND THE DUST ON THE ROAD WAS SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED AFTER SIX WEEKS OF DRY WEATHER OH I DO WISH IT WOULD RAIN SOON SIGHED ANNE EVERYTHING IS SO PARCHED UP THE POOR FIELDS JUST SEEM PITIFUL TO ME
0016-122828-0015 AND THE TREES SEEM TO BE STRETCHING OUT THEIR HANDS PLEADING FOR RAIN AS FOR MY GARDEN IT HURTS ME EVERY TIME I GO INTO IT I SUPPOSE I SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT A GARDEN WHEN THE FARMERS CROPS ARE SUFFERING SO
0016-122828-0016 MISTER HARRISON SAYS HIS PASTURES ARE SO SCORCHED UP THAT HIS POOR COWS CAN HARDLY GET A BITE TO EAT AND HE FEELS GUILTY OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS EVERY TIME HE MEETS THEIR EYES AFTER A WEARISOME DRIVE
0016-122828-0017 THE GIRLS REACHED SPENCERVALE AND TURNED DOWN THE TORY ROAD A GREEN SOLITARY HIGHWAY WHERE THE STRIPS OF GRASS BETWEEN THE WHEEL TRACKS BORE EVIDENCE TO LACK OF TRAVEL ALONG MOST OF ITS EXTENT IT WAS LINED WITH THICK SET YOUNG SPRUCES
0016-122828-0018 CROWDING DOWN TO THE ROADWAY WITH HERE AND THERE A BREAK WHERE THE BACK FIELD OF A SPENCERVALE FARM CAME OUT TO THE FENCE OR AN EXPANSE OF STUMPS WAS AFLAME WITH FIREWEED AND GOLDENROD WHY IS IT CALLED THE TORY ROAD ASKED ANNE
0016-122828-0019 MISTER ALLAN SAYS IT IS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF CALLING A PLACE A GROVE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TREES IN IT SAID DIANA FOR NOBODY LIVES ALONG THE ROAD EXCEPT THE COPP GIRLS
0016-122828-0020 JUST TO SHOW THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING DIANA'S FATHER WAS A LIBERAL FOR WHICH REASON SHE AND ANNE NEVER DISCUSSED POLITICS
0016-122828-0021 FINALLY THE GIRLS CAME TO THE OLD COPP HOMESTEAD A PLACE OF SUCH EXCEEDING EXTERNAL NEATNESS THAT EVEN GREEN GABLES WOULD HAVE SUFFERED BY CONTRAST THE HOUSE WAS A VERY OLD FASHIONED ONE SITUATED ON A SLOPE
0016-122828-0022 WHICH FACT HAD NECESSITATED THE BUILDING OF A STONE BASEMENT UNDER ONE END THE HOUSE AND OUT BUILDINGS WERE ALL WHITEWASHED TO A CONDITION OF BLINDING PERFECTION AND NOT A WEED WAS VISIBLE IN THE PRIM KITCHEN GARDEN SURROUNDED BY ITS WHITE PALING
0016-122828-0023 THAT IS THE PANTRY WINDOW I FEEL SURE SHE SAID
0016-122828-0024 DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE ANY HARM NO I DON'T THINK SO DECIDED ANNE AFTER DUE REFLECTION SINCE OUR MOTIVE IS NOT IDLE CURIOSITY THIS IMPORTANT POINT OF ETHICS BEING SETTLED ANNE PREPARED TO MOUNT THE AFORESAID LITTLE HOUSE
0016-122828-0025 A CONSTRUCTION OF LATHES WITH A PEAKED ROOF WHICH HAD IN TIMES PAST SERVED AS A HABITATION FOR DUCKS THE COPP GIRLS HAD GIVEN UP KEEPING DUCKS BECAUSE THEY WERE SUCH UNTIDY BIRDS
0016-122828-0026 SAVE AS AN ABODE OF CORRECTION FOR SETTING HENS ALTHOUGH SCRUPULOUSLY WHITEWASHED IT HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT SHAKY AND ANNE FELT RATHER DUBIOUS AS SHE SCRAMBLED UP FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A KEG PLACED ON A BOX I'M AFRAID IT WON'T BEAR MY WEIGHT
0016-122828-0027 SHE SAID AS SHE GINGERLY STEPPED ON THE ROOF
0016-122828-0028 ADVISED DIANA AND ANNE ACCORDINGLY LEANED MUCH TO HER DELIGHT SHE SAW AS SHE PEERED THROUGH THE PANE A WILLOW WARE PLATTER EXACTLY SUCH AS SHE WAS IN QUEST OF ON THE SHELF IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW
0016-122828-0029 AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE HAD CRASHED THROUGH THE ROOF UP TO HER ARMPITS AND THERE SHE HUNG QUITE UNABLE TO EXTRICATE HERSELF DIANA DASHED INTO THE DUCK HOUSE AND SEIZING HER UNFORTUNATE FRIEND BY THE WAIST
0016-122828-0030 DIANA HASTILY DRAGGED IN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED KEG AND ANNE FOUND THAT IT WAS JUST SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO FURNISH A SECURE RESTING PLACE FOR HER FEET BUT SHE COULD NOT RELEASE HERSELF
0016-122828-0031 ANNE SHOOK HER HEAD HOPELESSLY NO THE SPLINTERS HURT TOO BADLY IF YOU CAN FIND AN AXE YOU MIGHT CHOP ME OUT THOUGH OH DEAR I DO REALLY BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT I WAS BORN UNDER AN ILL OMENED STAR DIANA SEARCHED FAITHFULLY
0016-122828-0032 BUT NO AXE WAS TO BE FOUND I'LL HAVE TO GO FOR HELP SHE SAID RETURNING TO THE PRISONER NO INDEED YOU WON'T SAID ANNE VEHEMENTLY IF YOU DO THE STORY OF THIS WILL GET OUT EVERYWHERE AND I SHALL BE ASHAMED TO SHOW MY FACE
0016-122828-0033 NO WE MUST JUST WAIT UNTIL THE COPP GIRLS COME HOME AND BIND THEM TO SECRECY THEY'LL KNOW WHERE THE AXE IS AND GET ME OUT I'M NOT UNCOMFORTABLE AS LONG AS I KEEP PERFECTLY STILL NOT UNCOMFORTABLE IN BODY I MEAN
0016-122828-0034 I WONDER WHAT THE COPP GIRLS VALUE THIS HOUSE AT I SHALL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGE I'VE DONE BUT I WOULDN'T MIND THAT IF I WERE ONLY SURE THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND MY MOTIVE IN PEEPING IN AT THEIR PANTRY WINDOW MY SOLE COMFORT IS THAT THE PLATTER IS JUST THE KIND I WANT
0016-122828-0035 OR TILL TOMORROW SUGGESTED DIANA IF THEY'RE NOT BACK BY SUNSET YOU'LL HAVE TO GO FOR OTHER ASSISTANCE I SUPPOSE SAID ANNE RELUCTANTLY BUT YOU MUSTN'T GO UNTIL YOU REALLY HAVE TO
0016-122828-0036 OH DEAR THIS IS A DREADFUL PREDICAMENT I WOULDN'T MIND MY MISFORTUNES SO MUCH IF THEY WERE ROMANTIC AS MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES ALWAYS ARE
0016-122828-0037 AND SEE A GIRL'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS STICKING OUT OF THE ROOF OF ONE OF THEIR OUTHOUSES LISTEN IS THAT A WAGON
0016-122828-0038 AND DIANA HAVING MADE A HASTY PILGRIMAGE AROUND THE HOUSE RETURNED TO ANNOUNCE THAT A VERY BLACK CLOUD WAS RISING RAPIDLY IN THE NORTHWEST I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HEAVY THUNDER SHOWER SHE EXCLAIMED IN DISMAY
0016-122828-0039 WE MUST PREPARE FOR IT SAID ANNE TRANQUILLY A THUNDERSTORM SEEMED A TRIFLE IN COMPARISON WITH WHAT HAD ALREADY HAPPENED YOU'D BETTER DRIVE THE HORSE AND BUGGY INTO THAT OPEN SHED FORTUNATELY MY PARASOL IS IN THE BUGGY HERE TAKE MY HAT WITH YOU
0016-122828-0040 AND SHE WAS RIGHT AS SHE ALWAYS IS DIANA UNTIED THE PONY AND DROVE INTO THE SHED JUST AS THE FIRST HEAVY DROPS OF RAIN FELL THERE SHE SAT AND WATCHED THE RESULTING DOWNPOUR WHICH WAS SO THICK AND HEAVY
0016-122828-0041 THAT SHE COULD HARDLY SEE ANNE THROUGH IT HOLDING THE PARASOL BRAVELY OVER HER BARE HEAD THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF THUNDER BUT FOR THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR THE RAIN CAME MERRILY DOWN OCCASIONALLY
0016-122828-0042 ANNE SLANTED BACK HER PARASOL AND WAVED AN ENCOURAGING HAND TO HER FRIEND BUT CONVERSATION AT THAT DISTANCE WAS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION FINALLY THE RAIN CEASED THE SUN CAME OUT AND DIANA VENTURED ACROSS THE PUDDLES OF THE YARD
0016-122828-0043 DID YOU GET VERY WET SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY OH NO RETURNED ANNE CHEERFULLY MY HEAD AND SHOULDERS ARE QUITE DRY AND MY SKIRT IS ONLY A LITTLE DAMP WHERE THE RAIN BEAT THROUGH THE LATHES
0016-122828-0044 DON'T PITY ME DIANA FOR I HAVEN'T MINDED IT AT ALL I KEPT THINKING HOW MUCH GOOD THE RAIN WILL DO AND HOW GLAD MY GARDEN MUST BE FOR IT AND IMAGINING WHAT THE FLOWERS AND BUDS WOULD THINK WHEN THE DROPS BEGAN TO FALL
0016-122828-0045 SPREAD THE WRAPPING PAPER ON A SHINGLE DIANA HANDED UP AND WROTE OUT HER GARDEN IDYL UNDER CONDITIONS THAT COULD HARDLY BE CONSIDERED AS FAVORABLE TO LITERATURE NEVERTHELESS THE RESULT WAS QUITE PRETTY AND DIANA WAS ENRAPTURED WHEN ANNE READ IT TO HER OH
0016-122828-0046 ANNE SHOOK HER HEAD OH NO IT WOULDN'T BE SUITABLE AT ALL THERE IS NO PLOT IN IT YOU SEE IT'S JUST A STRING OF FANCIES I LIKE WRITING SUCH THINGS BUT OF COURSE NOTHING OF THE SORT WOULD EVER DO FOR PUBLICATION
0016-122828-0047 FOR EDITORS INSIST ON PLOTS SO PRISCILLA SAYS OH THERE'S MISS SARAH COPP NOW PLEASE DIANA GO AND EXPLAIN MISS SARAH COPP WAS A SMALL PERSON
0016-122828-0048 MISS COPP SHE SAID EARNESTLY I ASSURE YOU I LOOKED INTO YOUR PANTRY WINDOW ONLY TO DISCOVER IF YOU HAD A WILLOW WARE PLATTER I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE I DIDN'T LOOK FOR ANYTHING ELSE BLESS YOU THAT'S ALL RIGHT
0016-122828-0049 SAID MISS SARAH AMIABLY YOU NEEDN'T WORRY THERE'S NO HARM DONE THANK GOODNESS WE COPPS KEEP OUR PANTRIES PRESENTABLE AT ALL TIMES AND DON'T CARE WHO SEES INTO THEM AS FOR THAT OLD DUCKHOUSE I'M GLAD IT'S SMASHED
0016-122828-0050 FOR MAYBE NOW MARTHA WILL AGREE TO HAVING IT TAKEN DOWN SHE NEVER WOULD BEFORE FOR FEAR IT MIGHT COME IN HANDY SOMETIME AND I'VE HAD TO WHITEWASH IT EVERY SPRING BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL ARGUE WITH A POST AS WITH MARTHA SHE WENT TO TOWN TODAY I DROVE HER TO THE STATION
0016-122828-0051 TWENTY DOLLARS SAID ANNE WHO WAS NEVER MEANT TO MATCH BUSINESS WITS WITH A COPP OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE OFFERED HER PRICE AT THE START WELL I'LL SEE SAID MISS SARAH CAUTIOUSLY
0016-122828-0052 AS IT IS I DARESAY SHE'LL RAISE A FUSS MARTHA'S THE BOSS OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT I CAN TELL YOU I'M GETTING AWFUL TIRED OF LIVING UNDER ANOTHER WOMAN'S THUMB BUT COME IN COME IN YOU MUST BE REAL TIRED AND HUNGRY
0016-122828-0053 I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN FOR YOU IN THE WAY OF TEA BUT I WARN YOU NOT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT BREAD AND BUTTER AND SOME COWCUMBERS MARTHA LOCKED UP ALL THE CAKE AND CHEESE AND PRESERVES AFORE SHE WENT SHE ALWAYS DOES BECAUSE SHE SAYS I'M TOO EXTRAVAGANT WITH THEM IF COMPANY COMES
0016-122828-0054 BUT IT'S WORTH TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IT'S A VERY OLD PLATTER DIANA GAVE ANNE'S FOOT A GENTLE KICK UNDER THE TABLE MEANING DON'T AGREE SHE'LL LET IT GO FOR TWENTY IF YOU HOLD OUT BUT ANNE WAS NOT MINDED TO TAKE ANY CHANCES IN REGARD TO THAT PRECIOUS PLATTER
0016-122828-0055 SHE PROMPTLY AGREED TO GIVE TWENTY FIVE AND MISS SARAH LOOKED AS IF SHE FELT SORRY SHE HADN'T ASKED FOR THIRTY WELL I GUESS YOU MAY HAVE IT I WANT ALL THE MONEY I CAN SCARE UP JUST NOW THE FACT IS
0016-122828-0056 BUT I WAS TIMID AND FRIGHTENED OF FATHER BESIDES I DIDN'T KNOW MEN WERE SO SKURSE WHEN THE GIRLS WERE SAFELY AWAY DIANA DRIVING AND ANNE HOLDING THE COVETED PLATTER CAREFULLY ON HER LAP
0016-122828-0057 I'VE GOT THE PLATTER AND THAT RAIN HAS LAID THE DUST BEAUTIFULLY SO ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL WE'RE NOT HOME YET SAID DIANA RATHER PESSIMISTICALLY AND THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT MAY HAPPEN BEFORE WE ARE YOU'RE SUCH A GIRL TO HAVE ADVENTURES ANNE
0017-362-0000 WHY DID I LIVE WHY IN THAT INSTANT DID I NOT EXTINGUISH THE SPARK OF EXISTENCE WHICH YOU HAD SO WANTONLY BESTOWED I KNOW NOT
0017-362-0001 WHEN NIGHT CAME I QUITTED MY RETREAT AND WANDERED IN THE WOOD AND NOW NO LONGER RESTRAINED BY THE FEAR OF DISCOVERY I GAVE VENT TO MY ANGUISH IN FEARFUL HOWLINGS
0017-362-0002 I WAS LIKE A WILD BEAST THAT HAD BROKEN THE TOILS DESTROYING THE OBJECTS THAT OBSTRUCTED ME AND RANGING THROUGH THE WOOD WITH A STAG LIKE SWIFTNESS OH WHAT A MISERABLE NIGHT I PASSED
0017-362-0003 THE COLD STARS SHONE IN MOCKERY AND THE BARE TREES WAVED THEIR BRANCHES ABOVE ME NOW AND THEN THE SWEET VOICE OF A BIRD BURST FORTH AMIDST THE UNIVERSAL STILLNESS ALL
0017-362-0004 SPREAD HAVOC AND DESTRUCTION AROUND ME AND THEN TO HAVE SAT DOWN AND ENJOYED THE RUIN BUT THIS WAS A LUXURY OF SENSATION THAT COULD NOT ENDURE
0017-362-0005 I BECAME FATIGUED WITH EXCESS OF BODILY EXERTION AND SANK ON THE DAMP GRASS IN THE SICK IMPOTENCE OF DESPAIR THERE WAS NONE AMONG THE MYRIADS OF MEN
0017-362-0006 AND SHOULD I FEEL KINDNESS TOWARDS MY ENEMIES NO FROM THAT MOMENT I DECLARED EVERLASTING WAR AGAINST THE SPECIES AND MORE THAN ALL AGAINST HIM WHO HAD FORMED ME
0017-362-0007 AND SENT ME FORTH TO THIS INSUPPORTABLE MISERY THE SUN ROSE I HEARD THE VOICES OF MEN AND KNEW THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RETURN TO MY RETREAT DURING THAT DAY
0017-362-0008 ACCORDINGLY I HID MYSELF IN SOME THICK UNDERWOOD DETERMINING TO DEVOTE THE ENSUING HOURS TO REFLECTION ON MY SITUATION THE PLEASANT SUNSHINE AND THE PURE AIR OF DAY RESTORED ME TO SOME DEGREE OF TRANQUILLITY
0017-362-0009 AND WHEN I CONSIDERED WHAT HAD PASSED AT THE COTTAGE I COULD NOT HELP BELIEVING THAT I HAD BEEN TOO HASTY IN MY CONCLUSIONS I HAD CERTAINLY ACTED IMPRUDENTLY
0017-362-0010 IT WAS APPARENT THAT MY CONVERSATION HAD INTERESTED THE FATHER IN MY BEHALF AND I WAS A FOOL IN HAVING EXPOSED MY PERSON TO THE HORROR OF HIS CHILDREN I OUGHT TO HAVE FAMILIARIZED THE OLD DE LACEY TO ME AND BY DEGREES
0017-362-0011 TO HAVE DISCOVERED MYSELF TO THE REST OF HIS FAMILY WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR MY APPROACH
0017-362-0012 THESE THOUGHTS CALMED ME AND IN THE AFTERNOON I SANK INTO A PROFOUND SLEEP BUT THE FEVER OF MY BLOOD DID NOT ALLOW ME TO BE VISITED BY PEACEFUL DREAMS THE HORRIBLE SCENE OF THE PRECEDING DAY WAS
0017-362-0013 FOREVER ACTING BEFORE MY EYES THE FEMALES WERE FLYING AND THE ENRAGED FELIX TEARING ME FROM HIS FATHER'S FEET I AWOKE EXHAUSTED
0017-362-0014 I CREPT FORTH FROM MY HIDING PLACE AND WENT IN SEARCH OF FOOD WHEN MY HUNGER WAS APPEASED I DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARDS THE WELL KNOWN PATH THAT CONDUCTED TO THE COTTAGE ALL THERE WAS AT PEACE
0017-362-0015 I TREMBLED VIOLENTLY APPREHENDING SOME DREADFUL MISFORTUNE THE INSIDE OF THE COTTAGE WAS DARK AND I HEARD NO MOTION I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE AGONY OF THIS SUSPENSE
0017-362-0016 PRESENTLY TWO COUNTRYMEN PASSED BY BUT PAUSING NEAR THE COTTAGE THEY ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION USING VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS BUT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY SAID AS THEY SPOKE THE LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY
0017-362-0017 WHICH DIFFERED FROM THAT OF MY PROTECTORS SOON AFTER HOWEVER FELIX APPROACHED WITH ANOTHER MAN I WAS SURPRISED AS I KNEW THAT HE HAD NOT QUITTED THE COTTAGE THAT MORNING
0017-362-0018 AND WAITED ANXIOUSLY TO DISCOVER FROM HIS DISCOURSE THE MEANING OF THESE UNUSUAL APPEARANCES DO YOU CONSIDER SAID HIS COMPANION TO HIM THAT YOU WILL BE OBLIGED TO PAY THREE MONTHS RENT AND TO LOSE THE PRODUCE OF YOUR GARDEN
0017-362-0019 I DO NOT WISH TO TAKE ANY UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AND I BEG THEREFORE THAT YOU WILL TAKE SOME DAYS TO CONSIDER OF YOUR DETERMINATION IT IS UTTERLY USELESS REPLIED FELIX WE CAN NEVER AGAIN INHABIT YOUR COTTAGE THE LIFE OF MY FATHER IS IN THE GREATEST DANGER
0017-362-0020 MY WIFE AND MY SISTER WILL NEVER RECOVER FROM THEIR HORROR I ENTREAT YOU NOT TO REASON WITH ME ANY MORE TAKE POSSESSION OF YOUR TENEMENT AND LET ME FLY FROM THIS PLACE FELIX TREMBLED VIOLENTLY AS HE SAID THIS
0017-362-0021 I CONTINUED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY IN MY HOVEL IN A STATE OF UTTER AND STUPID DESPAIR MY PROTECTORS HAD DEPARTED AND HAD BROKEN THE ONLY LINK THAT HELD ME TO THE WORLD
0017-362-0022 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FEELINGS OF REVENGE AND HATRED FILLED MY BOSOM AND I DID NOT STRIVE TO CONTROL THEM BUT ALLOWING MYSELF TO BE BORNE AWAY BY THE STREAM I BENT MY MIND TOWARDS INJURY AND DEATH
0017-362-0023 AND A GUSH OF TEARS SOMEWHAT SOOTHED ME BUT AGAIN WHEN I REFLECTED THAT THEY HAD SPURNED AND DESERTED ME ANGER RETURNED A RAGE OF ANGER
0017-362-0024 AND AFTER HAVING DESTROYED EVERY VESTIGE OF CULTIVATION IN THE GARDEN I WAITED WITH FORCED IMPATIENCE UNTIL THE MOON HAD SUNK TO COMMENCE MY OPERATIONS AS THE NIGHT ADVANCED A FIERCE WIND
0017-362-0025 WAS QUICKLY ENVELOPED BY THE FLAMES WHICH CLUNG TO IT AND LICKED IT WITH THEIR FORKED AND DESTROYING TONGUES AS SOON AS I WAS CONVINCED THAT NO ASSISTANCE COULD SAVE ANY PART OF THE HABITATION I QUITTED THE SCENE
0017-362-0026 HATED AND DESPISED EVERY COUNTRY MUST BE EQUALLY HORRIBLE AT LENGTH THE THOUGHT OF YOU CROSSED MY MIND I LEARNED FROM YOUR PAPERS
0017-362-0027 THAT YOU WERE MY FATHER MY CREATOR AND TO WHOM COULD I APPLY WITH MORE FITNESS THAN TO HIM WHO HAD GIVEN ME LIFE AMONG THE LESSONS THAT FELIX HAD BESTOWED UPON SAFIE GEOGRAPHY HAD NOT BEEN OMITTED
0017-362-0028 BUT HOW WAS I TO DIRECT MYSELF I KNEW THAT I MUST TRAVEL IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION TO REACH MY DESTINATION BUT THE SUN WAS MY ONLY GUIDE I DID NOT KNOW THE NAMES OF THE TOWNS THAT I WAS TO PASS THROUGH NOR COULD I ASK
0017-362-0030 UNFEELING HEARTLESS CREATOR YOU HAD ENDOWED ME WITH PERCEPTIONS AND PASSIONS AND THEN CAST ME ABROAD AN OBJECT FOR THE SCORN AND HORROR OF MANKIND BUT ON YOU ONLY
0017-362-0031 AND THE SUFFERINGS I ENDURED INTENSE IT WAS LATE IN AUTUMN WHEN I QUITTED THE DISTRICT WHERE I HAD SO LONG RESIDED I TRAVELLED ONLY AT NIGHT FEARFUL OF ENCOUNTERING THE VISAGE OF A HUMAN BEING
0017-362-0032 NATURE DECAYED AROUND ME AND THE SUN BECAME HEATLESS RAIN AND SNOW POURED AROUND ME MIGHTY RIVERS WERE FROZEN THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WAS HARD AND CHILL AND BARE
0017-362-0033 AND I FOUND NO SHELTER OH EARTH HOW OFTEN DID I IMPRECATE CURSES ON THE CAUSE OF MY BEING
0017-362-0034 AND ALL WITHIN ME WAS TURNED TO GALL AND BITTERNESS
0017-362-0035 THE MORE DEEPLY DID I FEEL THE SPIRIT OF REVENGE ENKINDLED IN MY HEART SNOW FELL AND THE WATERS WERE HARDENED BUT I RESTED NOT
0017-362-0036 NO INCIDENT OCCURRED FROM WHICH MY RAGE AND MISERY COULD NOT EXTRACT ITS FOOD BUT A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAPPENED WHEN I ARRIVED ON THE CONFINES OF SWITZERLAND
0017-362-0037 I GENERALLY RESTED DURING THE DAY AND TRAVELLED ONLY WHEN I WAS SECURED BY NIGHT FROM THE VIEW OF MAN ONE MORNING HOWEVER FINDING THAT MY PATH LAY THROUGH A DEEP WOOD I VENTURED TO CONTINUE MY JOURNEY AFTER THE SUN HAD RISEN
0017-362-0038 THE DAY WHICH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OF SPRING CHEERED EVEN ME BY THE LOVELINESS OF ITS SUNSHINE AND THE BALMINESS OF THE AIR I FELT EMOTIONS OF GENTLENESS AND PLEASURE THAT HAD LONG APPEARED DEAD
0017-362-0039 REVIVE WITHIN ME HALF SURPRISED BY THE NOVELTY OF THESE SENSATIONS I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE BORNE AWAY BY THEM AND FORGETTING MY SOLITUDE AND DEFORMITY DARED TO BE HAPPY
0017-362-0040 SOFT TEARS AGAIN BEDEWED MY CHEEKS AND I EVEN RAISED MY HUMID EYES WITH THANKFULNESS TOWARDS THE BLESSED SUN WHICH BESTOWED SUCH JOY UPON ME
0017-362-0041 HERE I PAUSED NOT EXACTLY KNOWING WHAT PATH TO PURSUE WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES
0017-362-0042 I WAS SCARCELY HID WHEN A YOUNG GIRL CAME RUNNING TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE I WAS CONCEALED LAUGHING AS IF SHE RAN FROM SOMEONE IN SPORT
0017-362-0043 I SANK TO THE GROUND AND MY INJURER WITH INCREASED SWIFTNESS ESCAPED INTO THE WOOD THIS
0017-362-0044 INFLAMED BY PAIN I VOWED ETERNAL HATRED AND VENGEANCE TO ALL MANKIND BUT THE AGONY OF MY WOUND OVERCAME ME MY PULSES PAUSED AND I FAINTED
0017-362-0045 I HAD NO MEANS OF EXTRACTING IT MY SUFFERINGS WERE AUGMENTED ALSO BY THE OPPRESSIVE SENSE OF THE INJUSTICE AND INGRATITUDE OF THEIR INFLICTION MY DAILY VOWS ROSE FOR REVENGE A DEEP AND DEADLY REVENGE
0017-362-0046 SUCH AS WOULD ALONE COMPENSATE FOR THE OUTRAGES AND ANGUISH I HAD ENDURED AFTER SOME WEEKS MY WOUND HEALED AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY
0017-362-0047 OF PLEASURE BUT MY TOILS NOW DREW NEAR A CLOSE AND IN TWO MONTHS FROM THIS TIME I REACHED THE ENVIRONS OF GENEVA IT WAS EVENING WHEN I ARRIVED AND I RETIRED TO A HIDING PLACE AMONG THE FIELDS THAT SURROUND IT
0017-362-0048 TO MEDITATE IN WHAT MANNER I SHOULD APPLY TO YOU I WAS OPPRESSED BY FATIGUE AND HUNGER AND FAR TOO UNHAPPY TO ENJOY THE GENTLE BREEZES OF EVENING OR THE PROSPECT OF THE SUN SETTING BEHIND THE STUPENDOUS MOUNTAINS OF JURA
0017-362-0049 SUDDENLY AS I GAZED ON HIM AN IDEA SEIZED ME THAT THIS LITTLE CREATURE WAS UNPREJUDICED AND HAD LIVED TOO SHORT A TIME TO HAVE IMBIBED A HORROR OF DEFORMITY
0017-362-0050 IF THEREFORE I COULD SEIZE HIM AND EDUCATE HIM AS MY COMPANION AND FRIEND I SHOULD NOT BE SO DESOLATE IN THIS PEOPLED EARTH URGED BY THIS IMPULSE I SEIZED ON THE BOY AS HE PASSED AND DREW HIM TOWARDS ME
0017-362-0051 I DO NOT INTEND TO HURT YOU LISTEN TO ME
0017-362-0052 UGLY WRETCH YOU WISH TO EAT ME AND TEAR ME TO PIECES YOU ARE AN OGRE LET ME GO OR I WILL TELL MY PAPA BOY YOU WILL NEVER SEE YOUR FATHER AGAIN YOU MUST COME WITH ME HIDEOUS MONSTER LET ME GO
0017-362-0053 HE WILL PUNISH YOU YOU DARE NOT KEEP ME FRANKENSTEIN YOU BELONG THEN TO MY ENEMY TO HIM TOWARDS WHOM I HAVE SWORN ETERNAL REVENGE YOU SHALL BE MY FIRST VICTIM
0017-362-0054 THE CHILD STILL STRUGGLED AND LOADED ME WITH EPITHETS WHICH CARRIED DESPAIR TO MY HEART I GRASPED HIS THROAT TO SILENCE HIM AND IN A MOMENT HE LAY DEAD AT MY FEET
0017-362-0055 I GAZED ON MY VICTIM AND MY HEART SWELLED WITH EXULTATION AND HELLISH TRIUMPH CLAPPING MY HANDS I EXCLAIMED I TOO CAN CREATE DESOLATION MY ENEMY IS NOT INVULNERABLE
0017-362-0056 THIS DEATH WILL CARRY DESPAIR TO HIM AND A THOUSAND OTHER MISERIES SHALL TORMENT AND DESTROY HIM AS I FIXED MY EYES ON THE CHILD I SAW SOMETHING GLITTERING ON HIS BREAST I TOOK IT
0017-362-0057 IT WAS A PORTRAIT OF A MOST LOVELY WOMAN IN SPITE OF MY MALIGNITY IT SOFTENED AND ATTRACTED ME FOR A FEW MOMENTS I GAZED WITH DELIGHT ON HER DARK EYES
0017-362-0058 AND HER LOVELY LIPS BUT PRESENTLY MY RAGE RETURNED I REMEMBERED THAT I WAS FOREVER DEPRIVED OF THE DELIGHTS THAT SUCH BEAUTIFUL CREATURES COULD BESTOW AND THAT SHE WHOSE RESEMBLANCE I CONTEMPLATED WOULD IN REGARDING ME
0017-362-0059 TO ONE EXPRESSIVE OF DISGUST AND AFFRIGHT CAN YOU WONDER THAT SUCH THOUGHTS TRANSPORTED ME WITH RAGE I ONLY WONDER THAT AT THAT MOMENT
0017-362-0060 INSTEAD OF VENTING MY SENSATIONS IN EXCLAMATIONS AND AGONY I DID NOT RUSH AMONG MANKIND AND PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT TO DESTROY THEM WHILE I WAS OVERCOME BY THESE FEELINGS I LEFT THE SPOT WHERE I HAD COMMITTED THE MURDER AND SEEKING A MORE SECLUDED HIDING PLACE
0017-362-0061 I ENTERED A BARN WHICH HAD APPEARED TO ME TO BE EMPTY A WOMAN WAS SLEEPING ON SOME STRAW SHE WAS YOUNG NOT INDEED SO BEAUTIFUL AS HER WHOSE PORTRAIT I HELD
0017-362-0062 BUT OF AN AGREEABLE ASPECT AND BLOOMING IN THE LOVELINESS OF YOUTH AND HEALTH HERE I THOUGHT IS ONE OF THOSE WHOSE JOY IMPARTING SMILES ARE BESTOWED ON ALL BUT ME AND THEN I BENT OVER HER AND WHISPERED
0017-362-0063 MY BELOVED AWAKE THE SLEEPER STIRRED A THRILL OF TERROR RAN THROUGH ME SHOULD SHE INDEED AWAKE AND SEE ME AND CURSE ME AND DENOUNCE THE MURDERER THUS
0017-362-0064 WOULD SHE ASSUREDLY ACT IF HER DARKENED EYES OPENED AND SHE BEHELD ME THE THOUGHT WAS MADNESS
0017-362-0065 NOT I BUT SHE SHALL SUFFER THE MURDER I HAVE COMMITTED BECAUSE I AM FOREVER ROBBED OF ALL THAT SHE COULD GIVE ME SHE SHALL ATONE THE CRIME HAD ITS SOURCE IN HER
0017-362-0066 BE HERS THE PUNISHMENT THANKS TO THE LESSONS OF FELIX AND THE SANGUINARY LAWS OF MAN I HAD LEARNED NOW TO WORK MISCHIEF I BENT OVER HER
0017-362-0067 AND PLACED THE PORTRAIT SECURELY IN ONE OF THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS SHE MOVED AGAIN AND I FLED FOR SOME DAYS I HAUNTED THE SPOT WHERE THESE SCENES HAD TAKEN PLACE
0017-362-0068 SOMETIMES WISHING TO SEE YOU SOMETIMES RESOLVED TO QUIT THE WORLD AND ITS MISERIES FOREVER AT LENGTH I WANDERED TOWARDS THESE MOUNTAINS AND HAVE RANGED THROUGH THEIR
0017-362-0069 IMMENSE RECESSES CONSUMED BY A BURNING PASSION WHICH YOU ALONE CAN GRATIFY WE MAY NOT PART UNTIL YOU HAVE PROMISED TO COMPLY WITH MY REQUISITION I AM ALONE AND MISERABLE
0017-362-0070 MAN WILL NOT ASSOCIATE WITH ME BUT ONE AS DEFORMED AND HORRIBLE AS MYSELF WOULD NOT DENY HERSELF TO ME MY COMPANION MUST BE OF THE SAME SPECIES AND HAVE THE SAME DEFECTS
0017-363-0000 HE CONTINUED YOU MUST CREATE A FEMALE FOR ME WITH WHOM I CAN LIVE IN THE INTERCHANGE OF THOSE SYMPATHIES NECESSARY FOR MY BEING THIS YOU ALONE CAN DO AND I DEMAND IT OF YOU AS A RIGHT
0017-363-0001 WHICH YOU MUST NOT REFUSE TO CONCEDE THE LATTER PART OF HIS TALE HAD KINDLED ANEW IN ME THE ANGER THAT HAD DIED AWAY WHILE HE NARRATED HIS PEACEFUL LIFE AMONG THE COTTAGERS AND AS HE SAID THIS
0017-363-0002 I COULD NO LONGER SUPPRESS THE RAGE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME I DO REFUSE IT I REPLIED AND NO TORTURE SHALL EVER EXTORT A CONSENT FROM ME YOU MAY RENDER ME THE MOST MISERABLE OF MEN BUT YOU SHALL NEVER MAKE ME BASE IN MY OWN EYES
0017-363-0003 SHALL I CREATE ANOTHER LIKE YOURSELF WHOSE JOINT WICKEDNESS MIGHT DESOLATE THE WORLD BEGONE I HAVE ANSWERED YOU YOU MAY TORTURE ME BUT I WILL NEVER CONSENT YOU ARE IN THE WRONG REPLIED THE FIEND
0017-363-0004 AND INSTEAD OF THREATENING I AM CONTENT TO REASON WITH YOU I AM MALICIOUS BECAUSE I AM MISERABLE AM I NOT SHUNNED AND HATED BY ALL MANKIND
0017-363-0005 REMEMBER THAT AND TELL ME WHY I SHOULD PITY MAN MORE THAN HE PITIES ME YOU WOULD NOT CALL IT MURDER IF YOU COULD PRECIPITATE ME INTO ONE OF THOSE ICE RIFTS AND DESTROY MY FRAME THE WORK OF YOUR OWN HANDS
0017-363-0006 SHALL I RESPECT MAN WHEN HE CONDEMNS ME LET HIM LIVE WITH ME IN THE INTERCHANGE OF KINDNESS AND INSTEAD OF INJURY I WOULD BESTOW EVERY BENEFIT UPON HIM WITH TEARS OF GRATITUDE AT HIS ACCEPTANCE
0017-363-0007 BUT THAT CANNOT BE THE HUMAN SENSES ARE INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS TO OUR UNION YET MINE SHALL NOT BE THE SUBMISSION OF ABJECT SLAVERY I WILL REVENGE MY INJURIES
0017-363-0008 IF I CANNOT INSPIRE LOVE I WILL CAUSE FEAR AND CHIEFLY TOWARDS YOU MY ARCH ENEMY BECAUSE MY CREATOR DO I SWEAR INEXTINGUISHABLE HATRED HAVE A CARE
0017-363-0009 I WILL WORK AT YOUR DESTRUCTION NOR FINISH UNTIL I DESOLATE YOUR HEART SO THAT YOU SHALL CURSE THE HOUR OF YOUR BIRTH A FIENDISH RAGE ANIMATED HIM AS HE SAID THIS
0017-363-0010 WHAT I ASK OF YOU IS REASONABLE AND MODERATE I DEMAND A CREATURE OF ANOTHER SEX BUT AS HIDEOUS AS MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION IS SMALL
0017-363-0011 BUT IT IS ALL THAT I CAN RECEIVE AND IT SHALL CONTENT ME IT IS TRUE WE SHALL BE MONSTERS CUT OFF FROM ALL THE WORLD BUT ON THAT ACCOUNT WE SHALL BE MORE ATTACHED TO ONE ANOTHER
0017-363-0012 LET ME FEEL GRATITUDE TOWARDS YOU FOR ONE BENEFIT LET ME SEE THAT I EXCITE THE SYMPATHY OF SOME EXISTING THING DO NOT DENY ME MY REQUEST I WAS MOVED
0017-363-0013 I SHUDDERED WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF MY CONSENT BUT I FELT THAT THERE WAS SOME JUSTICE IN HIS ARGUMENT HIS TALE AND THE FEELINGS HE NOW EXPRESSED PROVED HIM TO BE A CREATURE OF FINE SENSATIONS
0017-363-0014 AND DID I NOT AS HIS MAKER OWE HIM ALL THE PORTION OF HAPPINESS THAT IT WAS IN MY POWER TO BESTOW
0017-363-0015 AND CONTINUED IF YOU CONSENT NEITHER YOU NOR ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING SHALL EVER SEE US AGAIN I WILL GO TO THE VAST WILDS OF SOUTH AMERICA MY FOOD IS NOT THAT OF MAN

0017-363-0018 REPLIED I TO FLY FROM THE HABITATIONS OF MAN TO DWELL IN THOSE WILDS WHERE THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD WILL BE YOUR ONLY COMPANIONS HOW CAN YOU WHO LONG FOR THE LOVE AND SYMPATHY OF MAN
0017-363-0019 PERSEVERE IN THIS EXILE YOU WILL RETURN AND AGAIN SEEK THEIR KINDNESS AND YOU WILL MEET WITH THEIR DETESTATION YOUR EVIL PASSIONS WILL BE RENEWED AND YOU WILL THEN HAVE A COMPANION TO AID YOU IN THE TASK OF DESTRUCTION
0017-363-0020 AND WHY DO YOU AGAIN HARDEN YOURSELF TO MY COMPLAINTS I SWEAR TO YOU BY THE EARTH WHICH I INHABIT AND BY YOU THAT MADE ME THAT WITH THE COMPANION YOU BESTOW I WILL QUIT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AND DWELL AS IT MAY CHANCE
0017-363-0021 IN THE MOST SAVAGE OF PLACES MY EVIL PASSIONS WILL HAVE FLED FOR I SHALL MEET WITH SYMPATHY MY LIFE WILL FLOW QUIETLY AWAY AND IN MY DYING MOMENTS I SHALL NOT CURSE MY MAKER
0017-363-0022 I HAD NO RIGHT TO WITHHOLD FROM HIM THE SMALL PORTION OF HAPPINESS WHICH WAS YET IN MY POWER TO BESTOW YOU SWEAR I SAID TO BE HARMLESS BUT HAVE YOU NOT
0017-363-0023 ALREADY SHOWN A DEGREE OF MALICE THAT SHOULD REASONABLY MAKE ME DISTRUST YOU MAY NOT EVEN THIS BE A FEINT THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR TRIUMPH BY AFFORDING A WIDER SCOPE FOR YOUR REVENGE HOW IS THIS
0017-363-0024 I MUST NOT BE TRIFLED WITH AND I DEMAND AN ANSWER IF I HAVE NO TIES AND NO AFFECTIONS HATRED AND VICE MUST BE MY PORTION THE LOVE OF ANOTHER WILL DESTROY THE CAUSE OF MY CRIMES
0017-363-0025 AND I SHALL BECOME A THING OF WHOSE EXISTENCE EVERYONE WILL BE IGNORANT MY VICES ARE THE CHILDREN OF A FORCED SOLITUDE THAT I ABHOR AND MY VIRTUES WILL
0017-363-0026 NECESSARILY ARISE WHEN I LIVE IN COMMUNION WITH AN EQUAL I SHALL FEEL THE AFFECTIONS OF A SENSITIVE BEING AND BECOME LINKED TO THE CHAIN OF EXISTENCE AND EVENTS FROM WHICH I AM NOW EXCLUDED
0017-363-0027 I THOUGHT OF THE PROMISE OF VIRTUES WHICH HE HAD DISPLAYED ON THE OPENING OF HIS EXISTENCE AND THE SUBSEQUENT BLIGHT OF ALL KINDLY FEELING BY THE LOATHING AND SCORN WHICH HIS PROTECTORS HAD MANIFESTED TOWARDS HIM HIS POWER AND THREATS
0017-363-0028 ON YOUR SOLEMN OATH TO QUIT EUROPE FOREVER AND EVERY OTHER PLACE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AS SOON AS I SHALL DELIVER INTO YOUR HANDS A FEMALE WHO WILL ACCOMPANY YOU IN YOUR EXILE I SWEAR HE CRIED BY THE SUN
0017-363-0029 AND BY THE BLUE SKY OF HEAVEN AND BY THE FIRE OF LOVE THAT BURNS MY HEART THAT IF YOU GRANT MY PRAYER WHILE THEY EXIST YOU SHALL NEVER BEHOLD ME AGAIN DEPART TO YOUR HOME AND COMMENCE YOUR LABOURS
0017-363-0030 BUT THAT WHEN YOU ARE READY I SHALL APPEAR SAYING THIS HE SUDDENLY QUITTED ME FEARFUL PERHAPS OF ANY CHANGE IN MY SENTIMENTS I SAW HIM DESCEND THE MOUNTAIN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN THE FLIGHT OF AN EAGLE
0017-363-0031 AND QUICKLY LOST AMONG THE UNDULATIONS OF THE SEA OF ICE
0017-363-0032 I KNEW THAT I OUGHT TO HASTEN MY DESCENT TOWARDS THE VALLEY AS I SHOULD SOON BE ENCOMPASSED IN DARKNESS BUT MY HEART WAS HEAVY AND MY STEPS SLOW THE LABOUR OF WINDING AMONG THE LITTLE PATHS OF THE MOUNTAIN
0017-363-0033 AND FIXING MY FEET FIRMLY AS I ADVANCED PERPLEXED ME OCCUPIED AS I WAS BY THE EMOTIONS WHICH THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY HAD PRODUCED NIGHT WAS FAR ADVANCED WHEN I CAME TO THE HALFWAY RESTING PLACE AND SEATED MYSELF BESIDE THE FOUNTAIN
0017-363-0034 THE STARS SHONE AT INTERVALS AS THE CLOUDS PASSED FROM OVER THEM THE DARK PINES ROSE BEFORE ME AND EVERY HERE AND THERE A BROKEN TREE LAY ON THE GROUND IT WAS A SCENE OF WONDERFUL SOLEMNITY
0017-363-0035 AND STIRRED STRANGE THOUGHTS WITHIN ME I WEPT BITTERLY AND CLASPING MY HANDS IN AGONY I EXCLAIMED OH STARS AND CLOUDS AND WINDS YE ARE ALL ABOUT TO MOCK ME
0017-363-0036 BUT I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW THE ETERNAL TWINKLING OF THE STARS WEIGHED UPON ME AND HOW I LISTENED TO EVERY BLAST OF WIND AS IF IT WERE A DULL UGLY SIROC ON ITS WAY TO CONSUME ME MORNING DAWNED BEFORE I ARRIVED AT THE VILLAGE OF
0017-363-0037 I TOOK NO REST BUT RETURNED IMMEDIATELY TO GENEVA EVEN IN MY OWN HEART I COULD GIVE NO EXPRESSION TO MY SENSATIONS THEY WEIGHED ON ME WITH A MOUNTAIN'S WEIGHT AND THEIR EXCESS DESTROYED MY AGONY BENEATH THEM
0017-363-0038 THUS I RETURNED HOME AND ENTERING THE HOUSE PRESENTED MYSELF TO THE FAMILY MY HAGGARD AND WILD APPEARANCE AWOKE INTENSE ALARM BUT I ANSWERED NO QUESTION SCARCELY DID I SPEAK
0017-363-0039 AND TO SAVE THEM I RESOLVED TO DEDICATE MYSELF TO MY MOST ABHORRED TASK THE PROSPECT OF SUCH AN OCCUPATION MADE EVERY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE OF EXISTENCE PASS BEFORE ME LIKE A DREAM

0022-121140-0039 THE WHOLE STORY OF MY LIFE LIES BEFORE ME NOW ITS GREAT CRISES WILL BE THE TEETHING AND NUTRITION OF THE YOUNG MASTERS DE L'ESTORADE AND THE MISCHIEF THEY DO TO MY SHRUBS AND ME TO EMBROIDER THEIR CAPS
0022-121140-0040 PERHAPS SOME DAY THE COUNTRY DAME MAY GO AND SPEND A WINTER IN MARSEILLES BUT DANGER DOES NOT HAUNT THE PURLIEUS OF A NARROW PROVINCIAL STAGE THERE WILL BE NOTHING TO FEAR NOT EVEN AN ADMIRATION SUCH AS COULD ONLY MAKE A WOMAN PROUD

0022-121140-0042 THAT HE WILL LEAVE THE REINS IN HIS WIFE'S HANDS AND AS I SHALL DO NOTHING TO REMIND HIM OF THIS WISE RESOLVE IT IS LIKELY HE MAY PERSEVERE IN IT YOU MY DEAR LOUISE WILL SUPPLY THE ROMANCE OF MY LIFE

0022-121140-0044 WILL HE FIND OUT THERE ARE TWO I AM WRITING NONSENSE NOW AND AS HENCEFORTH I CAN ONLY BE FOOLISH BY PROXY I HAD BETTER STOP ONE KISS THEN ON EACH CHEEK MY LIPS ARE STILL VIRGINAL HE HAS ONLY DARED TO TAKE MY HAND
0022-121140-0045 OH OUR DEFERENCE AND PROPRIETY ARE QUITE DISQUIETING I ASSURE YOU THERE I AM OFF AGAIN GOOD BYE DEAR P S I HAVE JUST OPENED YOUR THIRD LETTER
0022-121148-0000 LA CRAMPADE FEBRUARY MY DEAR LOUISE I WAS BOUND TO WAIT SOME TIME BEFORE WRITING TO YOU BUT NOW I KNOW OR RATHER I HAVE LEARNED MANY THINGS WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR FUTURE HAPPINESS I MUST TELL YOU
0022-121148-0001 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GIRL AND A MARRIED WOMAN IS SO VAST THAT THE GIRL CAN NO MORE COMPREHEND IT THAN THE MARRIED WOMAN CAN GO BACK TO GIRLHOOD AGAIN
0022-121148-0002 RATHER THAN RETURN TO THE CONVENT THAT AT LEAST IS PLAIN SO SOON AS I REALIZED THAT THE CONVENT WAS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO MARRYING LOUIS I HAD AS GIRLS SAY TO SUBMIT
0022-121148-0003 AND TRY TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT THE SERIOUS NATURE OF WHAT I WAS UNDERTAKING FILLED ME AT FIRST WITH TERROR MARRIAGE IS A MATTER CONCERNING THE WHOLE OF LIFE WHILST LOVE AIMS ONLY AT PLEASURE
0022-121148-0004 ON THE OTHER HAND MARRIAGE WILL REMAIN WHEN PLEASURES HAVE VANISHED AND IT IS THE SOURCE OF INTERESTS FAR MORE PRECIOUS THAN THOSE OF THE MAN AND WOMAN ENTERING ON THE ALLIANCE MIGHT IT NOT THEREFORE BE THAT THE ONLY REQUISITE FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE WAS FRIENDSHIP
0022-121148-0005 A FRIENDSHIP WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF THESE ADVANTAGES WOULD SHUT ITS EYES TO MANY OF THE IMPERFECTIONS OF HUMANITY NOW THERE WAS NO OBSTACLE TO THE EXISTENCE OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MYSELF AND LOUIS DE L'ESTORADE
0022-121148-0006 HAVING RENOUNCED ALL IDEA OF FINDING IN MARRIAGE THOSE TRANSPORTS OF LOVE ON WHICH OUR MINDS USED SO OFTEN AND WITH SUCH PERILOUS RAPTURE TO DWELL I FOUND A GENTLE CALM SETTLING OVER ME IF DEBARRED FROM LOVE
0022-121148-0007 WHY NOT SEEK FOR HAPPINESS I SAID TO MYSELF MOREOVER I AM LOVED AND THE LOVE OFFERED ME I SHALL ACCEPT MY MARRIED LIFE WILL BE NO SLAVERY BUT RATHER A PERPETUAL REIGN
0022-121148-0008 THE IMPORTANT POINT OF SEPARATING MARRIAGE FROM MARITAL RIGHTS WAS SETTLED IN A CONVERSATION BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME IN THE COURSE OF WHICH HE GAVE PROOF OF AN EXCELLENT TEMPER AND A TENDER HEART
0022-121148-0009 RETAINING PERFECT INDEPENDENCE WHAT COULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE MORE HONORABLE A CONTRACT OF THIS KIND DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE LEGAL CONTRACT AND EVEN TO THE SACRAMENT ITSELF COULD BE CONCLUDED ONLY BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME
0022-121148-0010 THIS DIFFICULTY THE FIRST WHICH HAS ARISEN IS THE ONLY ONE WHICH HAS DELAYED THE COMPLETION OF OUR MARRIAGE ALTHOUGH AT FIRST I MAY HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO ACCEPT ANYTHING RATHER THAN RETURN TO THE CONVENT IT IS ONLY IN HUMAN NATURE
0022-121148-0011 HAVING GOT AN INCH TO ASK FOR AN ELL AND YOU AND I SWEET LOVE ARE OF THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE IT ALL I WATCHED LOUIS OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE AND PUT IT TO MYSELF HAS SUFFERING HAD A SOFTENING OR A HARDENING EFFECT ON HIM
0022-121148-0012 BY DINT OF CLOSE STUDY I ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS LOVE AMOUNTED TO A PASSION ONCE TRANSFORMED INTO AN IDOL WHOSE SLIGHTEST FROWN WOULD TURN HIM WHITE AND TREMBLING I REALIZED THAT I MIGHT VENTURE ANYTHING
0022-121148-0013 I DREW HIM ASIDE IN THE MOST NATURAL MANNER ON SOLITARY WALKS DURING WHICH I DISCREETLY SOUNDED HIS FEELINGS I MADE HIM TALK AND GOT HIM TO EXPOUND TO ME HIS IDEAS AND PLANS FOR OUR FUTURE MY QUESTIONS BETRAYED SO MANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS
0022-121148-0014 THAT LOUIS HAS SINCE CONFESSED TO ME THE ALARM IT CAUSED HIM TO FIND IN ME SO LITTLE OF THE IGNORANT MAIDEN THEN I LISTENED TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY IN REPLY HE GOT MIXED UP IN HIS ARGUMENTS AS PEOPLE DO WHEN HANDICAPPED BY FEAR
0022-121148-0015 AND BEFORE LONG IT BECAME CLEAR THAT CHANCE HAD GIVEN ME FOR ADVERSARY ONE WHO WAS THE LESS FITTED FOR THE CONTEST BECAUSE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF WHAT YOU MAGNILOQUENTLY CALL MY GREATNESS OF SOUL BROKEN BY SUFFERINGS AND MISFORTUNE
0022-121148-0016 IN THE NEXT PLACE HE SHARES OUR VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT OF MY BEAUTY AND IT IS CRUEL FOR HIM TO SEE HOW THE HARDSHIPS OF HIS LIFE HAVE ROBBED HIM OF YOUTH FINALLY HE FELT THE SUPERIORITY OF MY WOMANHOOD OVER HIS MANHOOD
0022-121148-0017 THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THESE THREE OBVIOUS DRAWBACKS MADE HIM DISTRUSTFUL OF HIMSELF HE DOUBTED HIS POWER TO MAKE ME HAPPY AND GUESSED THAT HE HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS
0022-121148-0018 ONE EVENING HE TENTATIVELY SUGGESTED THAT I ONLY MARRIED HIM TO ESCAPE THE CONVENT I CANNOT DENY IT WAS MY GRAVE REPLY MY DEAR IT TOUCHED ME TO THE HEART TO SEE THE TWO GREAT TEARS WHICH STOOD IN HIS EYES
0022-121148-0019 THE FAVOR I AM ABOUT TO ASK FROM YOU WILL DEMAND UNSELFISHNESS ON YOUR PART FAR NOBLER THAN THE SERVITUDE TO WHICH A MAN'S LOVE WHEN SINCERE IS SUPPOSED TO REDUCE HIM THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU RISE TO THE HEIGHT OF FRIENDSHIP SUCH AS I UNDERSTAND IT
0022-121148-0020 LIFE GIVES US BUT ONE FRIEND AND I WISH TO BE YOURS FRIENDSHIP IS THE BOND BETWEEN A PAIR OF KINDRED SOULS UNITED IN THEIR STRENGTH AND YET INDEPENDENT LET US BE FRIENDS AND COMRADES TO BEAR JOINTLY THE BURDEN OF LIFE
0022-121148-0021 LEAVE ME ABSOLUTELY FREE I WOULD PUT NO HINDRANCE IN THE WAY OF YOUR INSPIRING ME WITH A LOVE SIMILAR TO YOUR OWN BUT I AM DETERMINED TO BE YOURS ONLY OF MY OWN FREE GIFT CREATE IN ME THE WISH TO GIVE UP MY FREEDOM
0022-121148-0022 INFUSE WITH PASSION THEN IF YOU WILL THIS FRIENDSHIP AND LET THE VOICE OF LOVE DISTURB ITS CALM ON MY PART I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO BRING MY FEELINGS INTO ACCORD WITH YOURS ONE THING ABOVE ALL I WOULD BEG OF YOU
0022-121148-0023 SPARE ME THE ANNOYANCES TO WHICH THE STRANGENESS OF OUR MUTUAL POSITION MIGHT GIVE RISE TO OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHERS I AM NEITHER WHIMSICAL NOR PRUDISH AND SHOULD BE SORRY TO GET THAT REPUTATION
0022-121148-0024 DO NOT FANCY I CONCLUDED THAT I ASK THIS FROM ANY WISH TO BE ECCENTRIC IT IS THE GREAT DESIRE I HAVE FOR YOUR RESPECT WHICH PROMPTS MY REQUEST IF YOU OWE THE CROWN OF YOUR LOVE MERELY TO THE LEGAL AND RELIGIOUS CEREMONY
0022-121148-0025 WHAT GRATITUDE COULD YOU FEEL TO ME LATER FOR A GIFT IN WHICH MY GOODWILL COUNTED FOR NOTHING IF DURING THE TIME THAT I REMAINED INDIFFERENT TO YOU YIELDING ONLY A PASSIVE OBEDIENCE SUCH AS MY MOTHER HAS JUST BEEN URGING ON ME A CHILD WERE BORN TO US
0022-121148-0026 IN A COUNTRY LIFE SUCH AS OURS WILL BE OUGHT WE NOT TO BEAR IN MIND THE EVANESCENT NATURE OF PASSION IS IT NOT SIMPLE PRUDENCE TO MAKE PROVISION BEFOREHAND AGAINST THE CALAMITIES INCIDENT TO CHANGE OF FEELING
0022-121148-0027 HE WAS GREATLY ASTONISHED TO FIND ME AT ONCE SO REASONABLE AND SO APT AT REASONING BUT HE MADE ME A SOLEMN PROMISE AFTER WHICH I TOOK HIS HAND AND PRESSED IT AFFECTIONATELY WE WERE MARRIED AT THE END OF THE WEEK
0022-121148-0028 SECURE OF MY FREEDOM I WAS ABLE TO THROW MYSELF GAILY INTO THE PETTY DETAILS WHICH ALWAYS ACCOMPANY A CEREMONY OF THE KIND AND TO BE MY NATURAL SELF PERHAPS I MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR AN OLD BIRD AS THEY SAY AT BLOIS
0022-121148-0029 DEAR THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH WOULD BESET MY LIFE HAD APPEARED TO ME CLEARLY AS IN A VISION AND I WAS SINCERELY ANXIOUS TO MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF THE MAN I MARRIED NOW IN THE SOLITUDE OF A LIFE LIKE OURS
0022-121148-0030 MARRIAGE SOON BECOMES INTOLERABLE UNLESS THE WOMAN IS THE PRESIDING SPIRIT A WOMAN IN SUCH A CASE NEEDS THE CHARM OF A MISTRESS COMBINED WITH THE SOLID QUALITIES OF A WIFE
0022-121148-0031 AND INVEST HER WITH AN EXHAUSTLESS POWER A REDUNDANCY OF LIFE THAT MAKES EVERYTHING BLOSSOM AROUND HER THE MORE SHE IS MISTRESS OF HERSELF THE MORE CERTAINLY WILL THE LOVE AND HAPPINESS SHE CREATES BE FIT TO WEATHER THE STORMS OF LIFE
0022-121148-0032 BUT ABOVE ALL I HAVE INSISTED ON THE GREATEST SECRECY IN REGARD TO OUR DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS A HUSBAND WHO SUBMITS TO HIS WIFE'S YOKE IS JUSTLY HELD AN OBJECT OF RIDICULE A WOMAN'S INFLUENCE OUGHT TO BE ENTIRELY CONCEALED
0022-121148-0033 IN THIS TASK TOWARDS WHICH MY EVERY ENERGY SHALL BE BENT WHILE IT REMAINS CONCEALED FROM ALL BUT GOD AND YOU I AM VERY NEARLY HAPPY NOW BUT SHOULD I BE SO WITHOUT A FRIENDLY HEART IN WHICH TO POUR THE CONFESSION FOR HOW MAKE A CONFIDANT OF HIM
0022-121148-0034 MY HAPPINESS WOULD WOUND HIM AND HAS TO BE CONCEALED HE IS SENSITIVE AS A WOMAN LIKE ALL MEN WHO HAVE SUFFERED MUCH FOR THREE MONTHS WE REMAINED AS WE WERE BEFORE MARRIAGE AS YOU MAY IMAGINE
0022-121148-0035 DURING THIS TIME I MADE A CLOSE STUDY OF MANY SMALL PERSONAL MATTERS WHICH HAVE MORE TO DO WITH LOVE THAN IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED IN SPITE OF MY COLDNESS LOUIS GREW BOLDER AND HIS NATURE EXPANDED I SAW ON HIS FACE A NEW EXPRESSION
0022-121148-0036 A LOOK OF YOUTH THE GREATER REFINEMENT WHICH I INTRODUCED INTO THE HOUSE WAS REFLECTED IN HIS PERSON INSENSIBLY I BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO HIS PRESENCE AND MADE ANOTHER SELF OF HIM
0022-121148-0037 BY DINT OF CONSTANT WATCHING I DISCOVERED HOW HIS MIND AND COUNTENANCE HARMONIZE THE ANIMAL THAT WE CALL A HUSBAND TO QUOTE YOUR WORDS DISAPPEARED AND ONE BALMY EVENING I DISCOVERED IN HIS STEAD A LOVER
0022-121148-0038 WHOSE WORDS THRILLED ME AND ON WHOSE ARM I LEANT WITH PLEASURE BEYOND WORDS IN SHORT TO BE OPEN WITH YOU AS I WOULD BE WITH GOD BEFORE WHOM CONCEALMENT IS IMPOSSIBLE THE PERFECT LOYALTY WITH WHICH HE HAD KEPT HIS OATH MAY HAVE PIQUED ME
0022-121148-0039 BITTERLY ASHAMED I STRUGGLED WITH MYSELF ALAS WHEN PRIDE IS THE ONLY MOTIVE FOR RESISTANCE EXCUSES FOR CAPITULATION ARE SOON FOUND WE CELEBRATED OUR UNION IN SECRET AND SECRET IT MUST REMAIN BETWEEN US
0022-121148-0040 WHEN YOU ARE MARRIED YOU WILL APPROVE THIS RESERVE ENOUGH THAT NOTHING WAS LACKING EITHER OF SATISFACTION FOR THE MOST FASTIDIOUS SENTIMENT OR OF THAT UNEXPECTEDNESS WHICH BRINGS IN A SENSE ITS OWN SANCTION
0022-121148-0041 EVERY WITCHERY OF IMAGINATION OF PASSION OF RELUCTANCE OVERCOME OF THE IDEAL PASSING INTO REALITY PLAYED ITS PART YET IN SPITE OF ALL THIS ENCHANTMENT I ONCE MORE STOOD OUT FOR MY COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE
0022-121148-0042 I CAN'T TELL YOU ALL MY REASONS FOR THIS TO YOU ALONE SHALL I CONFIDE EVEN AS MUCH AS THIS I BELIEVE THAT WOMEN WHETHER PASSIONATELY LOVED OR NOT LOSE MUCH IN THEIR RELATION WITH THEIR HUSBANDS BY NOT CONCEALING THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT MARRIAGE AND THE WAY THEY LOOK AT IT
0022-121148-0043 MY ONE JOY AND IT IS SUPREME SPRINGS FROM THE CERTAINTY OF HAVING BROUGHT NEW LIFE TO MY HUSBAND BEFORE I HAVE BORNE HIM ANY CHILDREN LOUIS HAS REGAINED HIS YOUTH STRENGTH AND SPIRITS HE IS NOT THE SAME MAN
0022-121148-0044 WITH MAGIC TOUCH I HAVE EFFACED THE VERY MEMORY OF HIS SUFFERINGS IT IS A COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS LOUIS IS REALLY VERY ATTRACTIVE NOW FEELING SURE OF MY AFFECTION HE THROWS OFF HIS RESERVE AND DISPLAYS UNSUSPECTED GIFTS
0022-121148-0045 TO BE THE UNCEASING SPRING OF HAPPINESS FOR A MAN WHO KNOWS IT AND ADDS GRATITUDE TO LOVE AH DEAR ONE THIS IS A CONVICTION WHICH FORTIFIES THE SOUL EVEN MORE THAN THE MOST PASSIONATE LOVE CAN DO
0022-121148-0046 THE FORCE THUS DEVELOPED AT ONCE IMPETUOUS AND ENDURING SIMPLE AND DIVERSIFIED BRINGS FORTH ULTIMATELY THE FAMILY THAT NOBLE PRODUCT OF WOMANHOOD WHICH I REALIZE NOW IN ALL ITS ANIMATING BEAUTY
0022-121148-0047 EVEN THE OLD MAN WOULD NOT BE A BLOT UPON MY PRETTY HOME AND HAS BROUGHT HIMSELF INTO LINE WITH ALL MY IMPROVEMENTS TO PLEASE ME HE HAS ADOPTED THE DRESS AND WITH THE DRESS THE MANNERS OF THE DAY WE HAVE ENGLISH HORSES
0022-121148-0048 AND OBTAINING FOR IT THE MAXIMUM OF PLEASURE WITH THE MINIMUM OF COST I HAVE ALREADY CONVINCED LOUIS OF THE NECESSITY OF GETTING ROADS MADE IN ORDER THAT HE MAY EARN THE REPUTATION OF A MAN INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE OF HIS DISTRICT
0022-121148-0049 I INSIST TOO ON HIS STUDYING A GREAT DEAL BEFORE LONG I HOPE TO SEE HIM A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF MY FAMILY AND HIS MOTHER'S I HAVE TOLD HIM PLAINLY THAT I AM AMBITIOUS
0022-121148-0050 AND THAT I WAS VERY WELL PLEASED HIS FATHER SHOULD CONTINUE TO LOOK AFTER THE ESTATE AND PRACTISE ECONOMIES BECAUSE I WISHED HIM TO DEVOTE HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO POLITICS IF WE HAD CHILDREN I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM ALL PROSPEROUS AND WITH GOOD STATE APPOINTMENTS
0022-121148-0051 UNDER PENALTY THEREFORE OF FORFEITING MY ESTEEM AND AFFECTION HE MUST GET HIMSELF CHOSEN DEPUTY FOR THE DEPARTMENT AT THE COMING ELECTIONS MY FAMILY WOULD SUPPORT HIS CANDIDATURE AND WE SHOULD THEN HAVE THE DELIGHT OF SPENDING ALL OUR WINTERS IN PARIS
0022-121148-0052 AH MY LOVE BY THE ARDOR WITH WHICH HE EMBRACED MY PLANS I CAN GAUGE THE DEPTH OF HIS AFFECTION TO CONCLUDE HERE IS A LETTER HE WROTE ME YESTERDAY FROM MARSEILLES WHERE HE HAD GONE TO SPEND A FEW HOURS MY SWEET RENEE
0022-121148-0053 WHEN I AM WITH YOU LOVE SO TRANSPORTS ME THAT I AM POWERLESS TO EXPRESS THE DEPTH OF MY AFFECTION I CAN BUT WORSHIP AND ADMIRE ONLY AT A DISTANCE DOES THE POWER OF SPEECH RETURN
0022-121148-0054 YOU ARE SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL RENEE AND YOUR BEAUTY IS OF THE STATUESQUE AND REGAL TYPE ON WHICH TIME LEAVES BUT LITTLE IMPRESSION NO DOUBT THE LOVE OF HUSBAND AND WIFE DEPENDS LESS ON OUTWARD BEAUTY THAN ON GRACES OF CHARACTER
0022-121148-0055 WHICH ARE YOURS ALSO IN PERFECTION STILL LET ME SAY THAT THE CERTAINTY OF HAVING YOUR UNCHANGING BEAUTY ON WHICH TO FEAST MY EYES GIVES ME A JOY THAT GROWS WITH EVERY GLANCE THERE IS A GRACE AND DIGNITY IN THE LINES OF YOUR FACE
0022-121148-0056 YOUR FAVORS TO ME HOWEVER SLIGHT WILL ALWAYS MAKE MY HAPPINESS IN THE FAR DISTANT FUTURE AS NOW FOR I AM SENSIBLE HOW MUCH DIGNITY THERE IS IN OUR PROMISE TO RESPECT EACH OTHER'S LIBERTY
0022-121148-0057 OUR OWN IMPULSE SHALL WITH US ALONE DICTATE THE EXPRESSION OF FEELING WE SHALL BE FREE EVEN IN OUR FETTERS I SHALL HAVE THE MORE PRIDE IN WOOING YOU AGAIN NOW THAT I KNOW THE REWARD YOU PLACE ON VICTORY YOU CANNOT SPEAK BREATHE
0022-121148-0058 ACT OR THINK WITHOUT ADDING TO THE ADMIRATION I FEEL FOR YOUR CHARM BOTH OF BODY AND MIND THERE IS IN YOU A RARE COMBINATION OF THE IDEAL THE PRACTICAL AND THE BEWITCHING WHICH SATISFIES ALIKE JUDGMENT A HUSBAND'S PRIDE DESIRE AND HOPE
0022-121148-0059 I LONG FOR THE DAY WHICH SHALL MAKE YOU A MOTHER THAT I MAY SEE YOU CONTENT WITH THE FULNESS OF YOUR LIFE MAY HEAR YOU IN THE SWEET VOICE I LOVE AND WITH THE THOUGHTS BLESS THE LOVE WHICH HAS REFRESHED MY SOUL AND GIVEN NEW VIGOR TO MY POWERS
0022-121148-0060 THE LOVE WHICH IS MY PRIDE AND WHENCE I HAVE DRAWN AS FROM A MAGIC FOUNTAIN FRESH LIFE
0022-121148-0061 I SHALL TAKE A LEADING PART IN THE PUBLIC LIFE OF THE DISTRICT AND ON YOU SHALL FALL THE RAYS OF A GLORY WHICH WILL OWE ITS EXISTENCE TO THE DESIRE OF PLEASING YOU SO MUCH FOR MY PUPIL DEAR DO YOU SUPPOSE HE COULD HAVE WRITTEN LIKE THIS BEFORE
0022-121148-0062 A YEAR HENCE HIS STYLE WILL HAVE STILL FURTHER IMPROVED LOUIS IS NOW IN HIS FIRST TRANSPORT WHAT I LOOK FORWARD TO IS THE UNIFORM AND CONTINUOUS SENSATION OF CONTENT WHICH OUGHT TO BE THE FRUIT OF A HAPPY MARRIAGE
0022-121148-0063 WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN IN PERFECT TRUST AND MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF GIVING VARIETY TO THE INFINITE THIS IS THE TASK SET BEFORE EVERY TRUE WIFE THE ANSWER BEGINS TO DAWN ON ME AND I SHALL NOT REST TILL I HAVE MADE IT MINE
0022-121148-0064 YOU SEE THAT HE FANCIES HIMSELF VANITY OF MEN THE CHOSEN OF MY HEART JUST AS THOUGH THERE WERE NO LEGAL BONDS NEVERTHELESS I HAVE NOT YET GOT BEYOND THAT EXTERNAL ATTRACTION WHICH GIVES US STRENGTH TO PUT UP WITH A GOOD DEAL
0022-121148-0065 YET LOUIS IS LOVABLE HIS TEMPER IS WONDERFULLY EVEN AND HE PERFORMS AS A MATTER OF COURSE ACTS ON WHICH MOST MEN WOULD PLUME THEMSELVES IN SHORT IF I DO NOT LOVE HIM I SHALL FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN BEING GOOD TO HIM
0022-121148-0066 SO HERE ARE MY BLACK HAIR AND MY BLACK EYES WHOSE LASHES ACT ACCORDING TO YOU LIKE VENETIAN BLINDS MY COMMANDING AIR AND MY WHOLE PERSON RAISED TO THE RANK OF SOVEREIGN POWER TEN YEARS HENCE DEAR

0175-123036-0000 JERRY BARKER I NEVER KNEW A BETTER MAN THAN MY NEW MASTER HE WAS KIND AND GOOD AND AS STRONG FOR THE RIGHT AS JOHN MANLY AND SO GOOD TEMPERED AND MERRY THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE COULD PICK A QUARREL WITH HIM

0175-127696-0003 IT IS A WELL PROPORTIONED RATHER HANDSOME TREE WITH GRAYISH BROWN BARK AND CROOKED MUCH DIVIDED BRANCHES WHICH COVER THE GREATER PART OF THE TRUNK BUT NOT SO DENSELY AS TO PREVENT IT BEING SEEN
0175-127696-0004 THE LOWER LIMBS LIKE THOSE OF MOST OTHER CONIFERS THAT GROW IN SNOWY REGIONS CURVE DOWNWARD GRADUALLY TAKE A HORIZONTAL POSITION ABOUT HALF WAY UP THE TRUNK THEN ASPIRE MORE AND MORE TOWARD THE SUMMIT
0175-127696-0005 THE SHORT RIGID NEEDLES IN FASCICLES OF TWO ARE ARRANGED IN COMPARATIVELY LONG CYLINDRICAL TASSELS AT THE ENDS OF THE TOUGH UP CURVING BRANCHES THE CONES ARE ABOUT TWO INCHES LONG GROWING IN CLUSTERS AMONG THE NEEDLES
0175-127696-0006 WITHOUT ANY STRIKING EFFECT EXCEPT WHILE VERY YOUNG WHEN THE FLOWERS ARE OF A VIVID CRIMSON COLOR AND THE WHOLE TREE APPEARS TO BE DOTTED WITH BRILLIANT FLOWERS THE STAMINATE FLOWERS ARE STILL MORE SHOWY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR GREAT ABUNDANCE
0175-127696-0007 OFTEN GIVING A REDDISH YELLOW TINGE TO THE WHOLE MASS OF FOLIAGE AND FILLING THE AIR WITH POLLEN NO OTHER PINE ON THE RANGE IS SO REGULARLY PLANTED AS THIS ONE COVERING MORAINES THAT EXTEND ALONG THE SIDES OF THE HIGH ROCKY VALLEYS FOR MILES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
0175-127696-0008 THE THIN BARK IS STREAKED AND SPRINKLED WITH RESIN AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SHOWERED UPON THE FOREST LIKE RAIN THEREFORE THIS TREE MORE THAN ANY OTHER IS SUBJECT TO DESTRUCTION BY FIRE DURING STRONG WINDS EXTENSIVE FORESTS ARE DESTROYED
0175-127696-0009 THE FLAMES LEAPING FROM TREE TO TREE IN CONTINUOUS BELTS THAT GO SURGING AND RACING ONWARD ABOVE THE BENDING WOOD LIKE PRAIRIE GRASS FIRES DURING THE CALM SEASON OF INDIAN SUMMER THE FIRE CREEPS QUIETLY ALONG THE GROUND
0175-127696-0010 ARRIVING AT THE FOOT OF A TREE
0175-127696-0011 INCREASING IN VELOCITY AND DRAGGING THE FLAMES UPWARD THEN THE LEAVES CATCH FORMING AN IMMENSE COLUMN OF FIRE BEAUTIFULLY SPIRED ON THE EDGES AND TINTED A ROSE PURPLE HUE IT RUSHES ALOFT THIRTY OR FORTY FEET ABOVE THE TOP OF THE TREE
0175-127696-0012 LEAVING THE TRUNKS AND BRANCHES SCARCELY SCARRED THE HEAT HOWEVER IS SUFFICIENT TO KILL THE TREE AND IN A FEW YEARS THE BARK SHRIVELS AND FALLS OFF FORESTS MILES IN EXTENT ARE THUS KILLED AND LEFT STANDING
0175-127696-0013 WITH THE BRANCHES ON BUT PEELED AND RIGID APPEARING GRAY IN THE DISTANCE LIKE MISTY CLOUDS LATER THE BRANCHES DROP OFF LEAVING A FOREST OF BLEACHED SPARS
0175-127696-0014 AT LENGTH THE ROOTS DECAY AND THE FORLORN GRAY TRUNKS ARE BLOWN DOWN DURING SOME STORM AND PILED ONE UPON ANOTHER ENCUMBERING THE GROUND UNTIL DRY AND SEASONED THEY ARE CONSUMED BY ANOTHER FIRE AND LEAVE THE GROUND READY FOR A FRESH CROP
0175-127696-0015 IN SHELTERED LAKE HOLLOWS ON BEDS OF ALLUVIUM THIS PINE VARIES SO FAR FROM THE COMMON FORM THAT FREQUENTLY IT COULD BE TAKEN FOR A DISTINCT SPECIES GROWING IN DAMP SODS LIKE GRASSES FROM FORTY TO EIGHTY FEET HIGH
0175-127696-0016 BENDING ALL TOGETHER TO THE BREEZE AND WHIRLING IN EDDYING GUSTS MORE LIVELY THAN ANY OTHER TREE IN THE WOODS I FREQUENTLY FOUND SPECIMENS FIFTY FEET HIGH LESS THAN FIVE INCHES IN DIAMETER BEING SO SLENDER AND AT THE SAME TIME CLAD WITH LEAFY BOUGHS
0175-127696-0017 IT IS OFTEN BENT AND WEIGHED DOWN TO THE GROUND WHEN LADEN WITH SOFT SNOW THUS FORMING FINE ORNAMENTAL ARCHES MANY OF THEM TO LAST UNTIL THE MELTING OF THE SNOW IN THE SPRING THE MOUNTAIN PINE
0175-127696-0018 THE MOUNTAIN PINE PINUS MONTICOLA IS THE NOBLEST TREE OF THE ALPINE ZONE HARDY AND LONG LIVED TOWERING GRANDLY ABOVE ITS COMPANIONS AND BECOMING STRONGER AND MORE IMPOSING
0175-127696-0019 JUST WHERE OTHER SPECIES BEGIN TO CROUCH AND DISAPPEAR AT ITS BEST IT IS USUALLY ABOUT NINETY FEET HIGH AND FIVE OR SIX FEET IN DIAMETER THOUGH YOU MAY FIND SPECIMENS HERE AND THERE CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN THIS
0175-127696-0020 IT IS AS MASSIVE AND SUGGESTIVE OF ENDURING STRENGTH AS AN OAK ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE TRUNK IS COMMONLY FREE OF LIMBS BUT CLOSE FRINGY TUFTS OF SPRAY OCCUR NEARLY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE GROUND
0175-127696-0021 ON TREES THAT OCCUPY EXPOSED SITUATIONS NEAR ITS UPPER LIMIT THE BARK IS DEEP REDDISH BROWN AND RATHER DEEPLY FURROWED THE MAIN FURROWS RUNNING NEARLY PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER AND CONNECTED ON THE OLD TREES BY CONSPICUOUS CROSS FURROWS
0175-127696-0022 THE CONES ARE FROM FOUR TO EIGHT INCHES LONG SMOOTH SLENDER CYLINDRICAL AND SOMEWHAT CURVED THEY GROW IN CLUSTERS OF FROM THREE TO SIX OR SEVEN AND BECOME PENDULOUS AS THEY INCREASE IN WEIGHT
0175-127696-0023 THIS SPECIES IS NEARLY RELATED TO THE SUGAR PINE AND THOUGH NOT HALF SO TALL IT SUGGESTS ITS NOBLE RELATIVE IN THE WAY THAT IT EXTENDS ITS LONG BRANCHES IN GENERAL HABIT IT IS FIRST MET ON THE UPPER MARGIN OF THE SILVER FIR ZONE
0175-127696-0024 SINGLY IN WHAT APPEARS AS CHANCE SITUATIONS WITHOUT MAKING MUCH IMPRESSION ON THE GENERAL FOREST CONTINUING UP THROUGH THE FORESTS OF THE TWO LEAVED PINE IT BEGINS TO SHOW ITS DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC IN THE MOST MARKED WAY
0175-127696-0025 AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND FEET EXTENDING ITS TOUGH RATHER SLENDER ARMS IN THE FROSTY AIR WELCOMING THE STORMS AND FEEDING ON THEM AND REACHING SOMETIMES TO THE GRAND OLD AGE
0175-127696-0026 THE WESTERN JUNIPER THE JUNIPER OR RED CEDAR JUNIPERUS OCCIDENTALIS IS PREEMINENTLY A ROCK TREE
0175-127696-0027 OCCUPYING THE BALDEST DOMES AND PAVEMENTS IN THE UPPER SILVER FIR AND ALPINE ZONES
0175-127696-0028 IN SUCH SITUATIONS ROOTED IN NARROW CRACKS OR FISSURES WHERE THERE IS SCARCELY A HANDFUL OF SOIL IT IS FREQUENTLY OVER EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER AND NOT MUCH MORE IN HEIGHT THE TOPS OF OLD TREES ARE ALMOST ALWAYS DEAD
0175-127696-0029 DECORATED WITH A FEW LEAFY SPRAYS REMINDING ONE OF THE CRUMBLING TOWERS OF OLD CASTLES SCANTILY DRAPED WITH IVY ITS HOMES ON BARE BARREN DOME AND RIDGE TOP SEEM TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FOR SAFETY AGAINST FIRE
0175-127696-0030 WITH SCARCE A TRACE OF THE ROCKY ANGULARITY AND BROKEN LIMBS SO CHARACTERISTIC A FEATURE THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF ITS RANGE IT NEVER MAKES ANYTHING LIKE A FOREST SELDOM EVEN A GROVE USUALLY IT STANDS OUT SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT
0175-127696-0031 CLINGING BY SLIGHT JOINTS TO THE ROCKS LIVING CHIEFLY ON SNOW AND THIN AIR AND MAINTAINING SOUND HEALTH ON THIS DIET FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE EVERY FEATURE OR EVERY GESTURE IT MAKES EXPRESSES STEADFAST DOGGED ENDURANCE
0175-127696-0032 THE BARK IS OF A BRIGHT CINNAMON COLOR AND IS HANDSOMELY BRAIDED AND RETICULATED ON THRIFTY TREES FLAKING OFF IN THIN SHINING RIBBONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES USED BY THE INDIANS FOR TENT MATTING
0175-127696-0033 ITS FINE COLOR AND PICTURESQUENESS ARE APPRECIATED BY ARTISTS BUT TO ME THE JUNIPER SEEMS A SINGULARLY STRANGE AND TACITURN TREE I HAVE SPENT MANY A DAY AND NIGHT IN ITS COMPANY
0175-127696-0034 IT SEEMS TO BE A SURVIVOR OF SOME ANCIENT RACE WHOLLY UNACQUAINTED WITH ITS NEIGHBORS ITS BROAD STUMPINESS OF COURSE MAKES WIND WAVING OR EVEN SHAKING OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT IT IS NOT THIS ROCKY RIGIDITY THAT CONSTITUTES ITS SILENCE
0175-127696-0035 IN CALM SUN DAYS THE SUGAR PINE PREACHES LIKE AN ENTHUSIASTIC APOSTLE WITHOUT MOVING A LEAF ON LEVEL ROCKS THE JUNIPER DIES STANDING AND WASTES INSENSIBLY OUT OF EXISTENCE LIKE GRANITE THE WIND EXERTING ABOUT AS LITTLE CONTROL OVER IT
0175-127696-0036 ALIVE OR DEAD AS IS DOES OVER A GLACIER BOULDER I HAVE SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME TRYING TO DETERMINE THE AGE OF THESE WONDERFUL TREES BUT AS ALL OF THE VERY OLD ONES ARE HONEY COMBED WITH DRY ROT I NEVER WAS ABLE TO GET A COMPLETE COUNT OF THE LARGEST
0175-127696-0037 SOME ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS OLD FOR THOUGH ON DEEP MORAINE SOIL THEY GROW ABOUT AS FAST AS SOME OF THE PINES ON BARE PAVEMENTS AND SMOOTHLY GLACIATED OVERSWEPT RIDGES IN THE DOME REGION THEY GROW VERY SLOWLY
0175-127696-0038 ONE ON THE STARR KING RIDGE ONLY TWO FEET ELEVEN INCHES IN DIAMETER
0175-127696-0039 ANOTHER ON THE SAME RIDGE ONLY ONE FOOT SEVEN AND A HALF INCHES IN DIAMETER HAD REACHED THE AGE OF EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR YEARS THE FIRST FIFTEEN INCHES FROM THE BARK OF A MEDIUM SIZE TREE SIX FEET IN DIAMETER ON THE NORTH TENAYA PAVEMENT
0175-127696-0040 HAD EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY NINE LAYERS OF WOOD BEYOND THIS THE COUNT WAS STOPPED BY DRY ROT AND SCARS THE LARGEST EXAMINED WAS THIRTY THREE FEET IN GIRTH OR NEARLY TEN FEET IN DIAMETER AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE FAILED TO GET ANYTHING LIKE A COMPLETE COUNT
0175-129587-0000 THE HUNTING OF THE MAN IT CAME BEFORE MY MIND WITH AN UNREASONABLE HOPE OF ESCAPE THAT THE OUTER DOOR OF MY ROOM WAS STILL OPEN TO ME I WAS CONVINCED NOW ABSOLUTELY ASSURED
0175-129587-0001 THAT MOREAU HAD BEEN VIVISECTING A HUMAN BEING ALL THE TIME SINCE I HAD HEARD HIS NAME I HAD BEEN TRYING TO LINK IN MY MIND IN SOME WAY THE GROTESQUE ANIMALISM OF THE ISLANDERS WITH HIS ABOMINATIONS AND NOW I THOUGHT I SAW IT ALL
0175-129587-0002 THESE CREATURES I HAD SEEN WERE THE VICTIMS OF SOME HIDEOUS EXPERIMENT THESE SICKENING SCOUNDRELS HAD MERELY INTENDED TO KEEP ME BACK TO FOOL ME WITH THEIR DISPLAY OF CONFIDENCE AND PRESENTLY TO FALL UPON ME WITH A FATE MORE HORRIBLE THAN DEATH
0175-129587-0003 WITH TORTURE AND AFTER TORTURE
0175-129587-0004 TO SEND ME OFF A LOST SOUL A BEAST TO THE REST OF THEIR COMUS ROUT I LOOKED ROUND FOR SOME WEAPON NOTHING THEN WITH AN INSPIRATION I TURNED OVER THE DECK CHAIR PUT MY FOOT ON THE SIDE OF IT
0175-129587-0005 AND TORE AWAY THE SIDE RAIL IT HAPPENED THAT A NAIL CAME AWAY WITH THE WOOD AND PROJECTING GAVE A TOUCH OF DANGER TO AN OTHERWISE PETTY WEAPON
0175-129587-0006 AND FOUND MONTGOMERY WITHIN A YARD OF IT HE MEANT TO LOCK THE OUTER DOOR I RAISED THIS NAILED STICK OF MINE AND CUT AT HIS FACE BUT HE SPRANG BACK I HESITATED A MOMENT THEN TURNED AND FLED ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE
0175-129587-0007 AND AS READY AS A HOSPITAL RABBIT FOR MY FATE HE EMERGED BEHIND THE CORNER FOR I HEARD HIM SHOUT PRENDICK THEN HE BEGAN TO RUN AFTER ME SHOUTING THINGS AS HE RAN THIS TIME RUNNING BLINDLY
0175-129587-0008 I WENT NORTHEASTWARD IN A DIRECTION AT RIGHT ANGLES TO MY PREVIOUS EXPEDITION ONCE AS I WENT RUNNING HEADLONG UP THE BEACH I GLANCED OVER MY SHOULDER AND SAW HIS ATTENDANT WITH HIM I RAN FURIOUSLY UP THE SLOPE OVER IT
0175-129587-0009 MY CHEST STRAINING MY HEART BEATING IN MY EARS AND THEN HEARING NOTHING OF MONTGOMERY OR HIS MAN AND FEELING UPON THE VERGE OF EXHAUSTION I DOUBLED SHARPLY BACK TOWARDS THE BEACH AS I JUDGED AND LAY DOWN IN THE SHELTER OF A CANEBRAKE
0175-129587-0010 THERE I REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME TOO FEARFUL TO MOVE AND INDEED TOO FEARFUL EVEN TO PLAN A COURSE OF ACTION THE WILD SCENE ABOUT ME LAY SLEEPING SILENTLY UNDER THE SUN
0175-129587-0011 AND THE ONLY SOUND NEAR ME WAS THE THIN HUM OF SOME SMALL GNATS THAT HAD DISCOVERED ME PRESENTLY I BECAME AWARE OF A DROWSY BREATHING SOUND
0175-129587-0012 AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR I HEARD MONTGOMERY SHOUTING MY NAME FAR AWAY TO THE NORTH THAT SET ME THINKING OF MY PLAN OF ACTION AS I INTERPRETED IT THEN
0175-129587-0013 THIS ISLAND WAS INHABITED ONLY BY THESE TWO VIVISECTORS AND THEIR ANIMALISED VICTIMS SOME OF THESE NO DOUBT THEY COULD PRESS INTO THEIR SERVICE AGAINST ME IF NEED AROSE I KNEW BOTH MOREAU AND MONTGOMERY CARRIED REVOLVERS
0175-129587-0014 AND SAVE FOR A FEEBLE BAR OF DEAL SPIKED WITH A SMALL NAIL THE MEREST MOCKERY OF A MACE I WAS UNARMED
0175-129587-0015 UNTIL I BEGAN TO THINK OF FOOD AND DRINK
0175-129587-0016 I KNEW NO WAY OF GETTING ANYTHING TO EAT I WAS TOO IGNORANT OF BOTANY TO DISCOVER ANY RESORT OF ROOT OR FRUIT THAT MIGHT LIE ABOUT ME I HAD NO MEANS OF TRAPPING THE FEW RABBITS UPON THE ISLAND
0175-129587-0017 IT GREW BLANKER THE MORE I TURNED THE PROSPECT OVER AT LAST IN THE DESPERATION OF MY POSITION MY MIND TURNED TO THE ANIMAL MEN I HAD ENCOUNTERED I TRIED TO FIND SOME HOPE IN WHAT I REMEMBERED OF THEM
0175-129587-0018 IN TURN I RECALLED EACH ONE I HAD SEEN AND TRIED TO DRAW SOME AUGURY OF ASSISTANCE FROM MY MEMORY THEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A STAGHOUND BAY AND AT THAT REALISED A NEW DANGER I TOOK LITTLE TIME TO THINK
0175-129587-0019 BUT SNATCHING UP MY NAILED STICK RUSHED HEADLONG FROM MY HIDING PLACE TOWARDS THE SOUND OF THE SEA I REMEMBER A GROWTH OF THORNY PLANTS WITH SPINES THAT STABBED LIKE PEN KNIVES I EMERGED BLEEDING AND WITH TORN CLOTHES UPON THE LIP OF A LONG CREEK OPENING NORTHWARD
0175-129587-0020 WADING UP THE CREEK AND PRESENTLY FINDING MYSELF KNEEDEEP IN A LITTLE STREAM I SCRAMBLED OUT AT LAST ON THE WESTWARD BANK AND WITH MY HEART BEATING LOUDLY IN MY EARS CREPT INTO A TANGLE OF FERNS TO AWAIT THE ISSUE I HEARD THE DOG
0175-129587-0021 DRAW NEARER AND YELP WHEN IT CAME TO THE THORNS THEN I HEARD NO MORE AND PRESENTLY BEGAN TO THINK I HAD ESCAPED THE MINUTES PASSED THE SILENCE LENGTHENED OUT AND AT LAST AFTER AN HOUR OF SECURITY MY COURAGE BEGAN TO RETURN TO ME
0175-129587-0022 I REMEMBERED THAT IF I WERE TOO HARD PRESSED AT LEAST ONE PATH OF ESCAPE FROM TORMENT STILL LAY OPEN TO ME
0175-129587-0023 I HAD HALF A MIND TO DROWN MYSELF THEN BUT AN ODD WISH TO SEE THE WHOLE ADVENTURE OUT A QUEER IMPERSONAL SPECTACULAR INTEREST IN MYSELF RESTRAINED ME
0175-129587-0024 I STRETCHED MY LIMBS SORE AND PAINFUL FROM THE PRICKS OF THE SPINY PLANTS AND STARED AROUND ME AT THE TREES
0175-129587-0025 MY EYES LIT UPON A BLACK FACE WATCHING ME I SAW THAT IT WAS THE SIMIAN CREATURE WHO HAD MET THE LAUNCH UPON THE BEACH HE WAS CLINGING TO THE OBLIQUE STEM OF A PALM TREE I GRIPPED MY STICK AND STOOD UP FACING HIM
0175-129587-0026 HE BEGAN CHATTERING YOU YOU YOU WAS ALL I COULD DISTINGUISH AT FIRST SUDDENLY HE DROPPED FROM THE TREE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT WAS HOLDING THE FRONDS APART AND STARING CURIOUSLY AT ME
0175-129587-0027 YOU HE SAID IN THE BOAT HE WAS A MAN THEN AT LEAST AS MUCH OF A MAN AS MONTGOMERY'S ATTENDANT FOR HE COULD TALK YES I SAID I CAME IN THE BOAT FROM THE SHIP OH HE SAID
0175-129587-0028 AND HIS BRIGHT RESTLESS EYES TRAVELLED OVER ME TO MY HANDS TO THE STICK I CARRIED TO MY FEET TO THE TATTERED PLACES IN MY COAT AND THE CUTS AND SCRATCHES I HAD RECEIVED FROM THE THORNS HE SEEMED PUZZLED AT SOMETHING HIS EYES CAME BACK TO MY HANDS
0175-129587-0029 HE HELD HIS OWN HAND OUT AND COUNTED HIS DIGITS SLOWLY ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE EIGH I DID NOT GRASP HIS MEANING THEN
0175-129587-0030 AFTERWARDS I WAS TO FIND THAT A GREAT PROPORTION OF THESE BEAST PEOPLE HAD MALFORMED HANDS LACKING SOMETIMES EVEN THREE DIGITS BUT GUESSING THIS WAS IN SOME WAY A GREETING I DID THE SAME THING BY WAY OF REPLY HE GRINNED WITH IMMENSE SATISFACTION
0175-129587-0031 HE MADE A SWIFT MOVEMENT AND VANISHED THE FERN FRONDS HE HAD STOOD BETWEEN CAME SWISHING TOGETHER I PUSHED OUT OF THE BRAKE AFTER HIM AND WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND HIM SWINGING CHEERFULLY BY ONE LANK ARM
0175-129587-0032 FROM A ROPE OF CREEPERS THAT LOOPED DOWN FROM THE FOLIAGE OVERHEAD HIS BACK WAS TO ME HULLO SAID I HE CAME DOWN WITH A TWISTING JUMP AND STOOD FACING ME I SAY SAID I
0175-129587-0033 WHERE CAN I GET SOMETHING TO EAT EAT HE SAID EAT MAN'S FOOD NOW
0175-129587-0034 COME ALONG SAID HE I WENT WITH HIM TO SEE THE ADVENTURE OUT I GUESSED THE HUTS WERE SOME ROUGH SHELTER WHERE HE AND SOME MORE OF THESE BEAST PEOPLE LIVED I MIGHT PERHAPS FIND THEM FRIENDLY
0175-129587-0035 FIND SOME HANDLE IN THEIR MINDS TO TAKE HOLD OF
0175-129587-0036 MY APE LIKE COMPANION TROTTED ALONG BY MY SIDE WITH HIS HANDS HANGING DOWN AND HIS JAW THRUST FORWARD
0175-129587-0037 HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ON THIS ISLAND SAID I HOW LONG HE ASKED AND AFTER HAVING THE QUESTION REPEATED HE HELD UP THREE FINGERS THE CREATURE WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN AN IDIOT
0175-129587-0038 I TRIED TO MAKE OUT WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT AND IT SEEMS I BORED HIM AFTER ANOTHER QUESTION OR TWO
0175-129587-0039 AND SO TO A BARE PLACE COVERED WITH A YELLOW WHITE INCRUSTATION
0175-129587-0040 I SAW THE LEVEL BLUE OF THE SEA THE PATH COILED DOWN ABRUPTLY INTO A NARROW RAVINE BETWEEN TWO TUMBLED AND KNOTTY MASSES OF BLACKISH SCORIAE INTO THIS WE PLUNGED IT WAS EXTREMELY DARK THIS PASSAGE
0175-129587-0041 AFTER THE BLINDING SUNLIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE SULPHUROUS GROUND
0175-129587-0042 BLOTCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON DRIFTED ACROSS MY EYES MY CONDUCTOR STOPPED SUDDENLY HOME SAID HE AND I STOOD IN A FLOOR OF A CHASM THAT WAS AT FIRST ABSOLUTELY DARK TO ME
0175-129587-0043 I HEARD SOME STRANGE NOISES AND THRUST THE KNUCKLES OF MY LEFT HAND INTO MY EYES I BECAME AWARE OF A DISAGREEABLE ODOR LIKE THAT OF A MONKEY'S CAGE ILL CLEANED BEYOND THE ROCK OPENED AGAIN UPON A GRADUAL SLOPE OF SUNLIT GREENERY
0176-122025-0000 IT WAS A BRIGHT MORNING IN THE EARLY PART OF SUMMER THE RIVER HAD RESUMED ITS WONTED BANKS AND ITS ACCUSTOMED PACE AND A HOT SUN SEEMED TO BE PULLING EVERYTHING GREEN AND BUSHY AND SPIKY UP OUT OF THE EARTH TOWARDS HIM AS IF BY STRINGS
0176-122025-0001 THIS WAS A WONDERFUL THING INDEED THAT THE BADGER SHOULD PAY A FORMAL CALL ON THEM OR INDEED ON ANYBODY HE GENERALLY HAD TO BE CAUGHT IF YOU WANTED HIM BADLY AS HE SLIPPED QUIETLY ALONG A HEDGEROW OF AN EARLY MORNING OR A LATE EVENING
0176-122025-0002 OR ELSE HUNTED UP IN HIS OWN HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOOD WHICH WAS A SERIOUS UNDERTAKING THE BADGER STRODE HEAVILY INTO THE ROOM AND STOOD LOOKING AT THE TWO ANIMALS WITH AN EXPRESSION FULL OF SERIOUSNESS THE RAT LET HIS EGG SPOON FALL ON THE TABLE CLOTH AND SAT OPEN MOUTHED
0176-122025-0003 I SAID I WOULD TAKE HIM IN HAND AS SOON AS THE WINTER WAS WELL OVER AND I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM IN HAND TO DAY TOAD'S HOUR OF COURSE CRIED THE MOLE DELIGHTEDLY HOORAY
0176-122025-0004 WE'LL TEACH HIM TO BE A SENSIBLE TOAD THIS VERY MORNING CONTINUED THE BADGER TAKING AN ARM CHAIR AS I LEARNT LAST NIGHT FROM A TRUSTWORTHY SOURCE
0176-122025-0005 ANOTHER NEW AND EXCEPTIONALLY POWERFUL MOTOR CAR WILL ARRIVE AT TOAD HALL ON APPROVAL OR RETURN AT THIS VERY MOMENT PERHAPS TOAD IS BUSY ARRAYING HIMSELF IN THOSE SINGULARLY HIDEOUS HABILIMENTS SO DEAR TO HIM
0176-122025-0006 YOU TWO ANIMALS WILL ACCOMPANY ME INSTANTLY TO TOAD HALL AND THE WORK OF RESCUE SHALL BE ACCOMPLISHED RIGHT YOU ARE CRIED THE RAT STARTING UP WE'LL RESCUE THE POOR UNHAPPY ANIMAL WE'LL CONVERT HIM
0176-122025-0007 THEY SET OFF UP THE ROAD ON THEIR MISSION OF MERCY BADGER LEADING THE WAY ANIMALS WHEN IN COMPANY WALK IN A PROPER AND SENSIBLE MANNER IN SINGLE FILE INSTEAD OF SPRAWLING ALL ACROSS THE ROAD AND BEING OF NO USE OR SUPPORT TO EACH OTHER IN CASE OF SUDDEN TROUBLE OR DANGER
0176-122025-0008 THEY REACHED THE CARRIAGE DRIVE OF TOAD HALL TO FIND AS THE BADGER HAD ANTICIPATED A SHINY NEW MOTOR CAR OF GREAT SIZE
0176-122025-0009 STANDING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS THEY NEARED THE DOOR IT WAS FLUNG OPEN AND MISTER TOAD ARRAYED IN GOGGLES CAP GAITERS AND ENORMOUS OVERCOAT CAME SWAGGERING DOWN THE STEPS DRAWING ON HIS GAUNTLETED GLOVES HULLO
0176-122025-0010 COME ON YOU FELLOWS HE CRIED CHEERFULLY ON CATCHING SIGHT OF THEM YOU'RE JUST IN TIME TO COME WITH ME FOR A JOLLY TO COME FOR A JOLLY FOR A ER JOLLY
0176-122025-0011 HIS HEARTY ACCENTS FALTERED AND FELL AWAY AS HE NOTICED THE STERN UNBENDING LOOK ON THE COUNTENANCES OF HIS SILENT FRIENDS AND HIS INVITATION REMAINED UNFINISHED THE BADGER STRODE UP THE STEPS TAKE HIM INSIDE HE SAID STERNLY TO HIS COMPANIONS
0176-122025-0012 THEN AS TOAD WAS HUSTLED THROUGH THE DOOR STRUGGLING AND PROTESTING HE TURNED TO THE CHAUFFEUR IN CHARGE OF THE NEW MOTOR CAR I'M AFRAID YOU WON'T BE WANTED TO DAY HE SAID MISTER TOAD HAS CHANGED HIS MIND
0176-122025-0013 HE WILL NOT REQUIRE THE CAR PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS FINAL YOU NEEDN'T WAIT THEN HE FOLLOWED THE OTHERS INSIDE AND SHUT THE DOOR
0176-122025-0014 I DEMAND AN INSTANT EXPLANATION TAKE THEM OFF HIM THEN YOU TWO ORDERED THE BADGER BRIEFLY THEY HAD TO LAY TOAD OUT ON THE FLOOR KICKING AND CALLING ALL SORTS OF NAMES BEFORE THEY COULD GET TO WORK PROPERLY
0176-122025-0015 THEN THE RAT SAT ON HIM AND THE MOLE GOT HIS MOTOR CLOTHES OFF HIM BIT BY BIT AND THEY STOOD HIM UP ON HIS LEGS AGAIN A GOOD DEAL OF HIS BLUSTERING SPIRIT SEEMED TO HAVE EVAPORATED WITH THE REMOVAL OF HIS FINE PANOPLY
0176-122025-0016 NOW THAT HE WAS MERELY TOAD AND NO LONGER THE TERROR OF THE HIGHWAY HE GIGGLED FEEBLY AND LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER APPEALINGLY
0176-122025-0017 YOU KNEW IT MUST COME TO THIS SOONER OR LATER TOAD THE BADGER EXPLAINED SEVERELY YOU'VE DISREGARDED ALL THE WARNINGS WE'VE GIVEN YOU
0176-122025-0018 YOU'VE GONE ON SQUANDERING THE MONEY YOUR FATHER LEFT YOU AND YOU'RE GETTING US ANIMALS A BAD NAME IN THE DISTRICT BY YOUR FURIOUS DRIVING AND YOUR SMASHES AND YOUR ROWS WITH THE POLICE
0176-122025-0019 I'LL MAKE ONE MORE EFFORT TO BRING YOU TO REASON YOU WILL COME WITH ME INTO THE SMOKING ROOM AND THERE YOU WILL HEAR SOME FACTS ABOUT YOURSELF AND WE'LL SEE WHETHER YOU COME OUT OF THAT ROOM THE SAME TOAD THAT YOU WENT IN
0176-122025-0020 HE TOOK TOAD FIRMLY BY THE ARM LED HIM INTO THE SMOKING ROOM AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM THAT'S NO GOOD SAID THE RAT CONTEMPTUOUSLY
0176-122025-0021 AND PRESENTLY THEY NOTICED THAT THE SERMON BEGAN TO BE PUNCTUATED AT INTERVALS BY LONG DRAWN SOBS EVIDENTLY PROCEEDING FROM THE BOSOM OF TOAD WHO WAS A SOFT HEARTED AND AFFECTIONATE FELLOW VERY EASILY CONVERTED FOR THE TIME BEING TO ANY POINT OF VIEW
0176-122025-0022 AFTER SOME THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR THE DOOR OPENED AND THE BADGER REAPPEARED SOLEMNLY LEADING BY THE PAW A VERY LIMP AND DEJECTED TOAD HIS SKIN HUNG BAGGILY ABOUT HIM
0176-122025-0023 AND HE HAS UNDERTAKEN TO GIVE UP MOTOR CARS ENTIRELY AND FOR EVER I HAVE HIS SOLEMN PROMISE TO THAT EFFECT THAT IS VERY GOOD NEWS SAID THE MOLE GRAVELY VERY GOOD NEWS INDEED OBSERVED THE RAT DUBIOUSLY
0176-122025-0024 HE WAS LOOKING VERY HARD AT TOAD AS HE SAID THIS AND COULD NOT HELP THINKING HE PERCEIVED SOMETHING VAGUELY RESEMBLING A TWINKLE IN THAT ANIMAL'S STILL SORROWFUL EYE THERE'S ONLY ONE THING MORE TO BE DONE CONTINUED THE GRATIFIED BADGER TOAD
0176-122025-0025 TOAD LOOKED DESPERATELY THIS WAY AND THAT WHILE THE OTHER ANIMALS WAITED IN GRAVE SILENCE AT LAST HE SPOKE NO HE SAID A LITTLE SULLENLY BUT STOUTLY I'M NOT SORRY AND IT WASN'T FOLLY AT ALL IT WAS SIMPLY GLORIOUS
0176-122025-0026 WHAT CRIED THE BADGER GREATLY SCANDALISED YOU BACKSLIDING ANIMAL

0176-122025-0028 AND I FIND THAT I'M NOT A BIT SORRY OR REPENTANT REALLY SO IT'S NO EARTHLY GOOD SAYING I AM NOW IS IT THEN YOU DON'T PROMISE SAID THE BADGER NEVER TO TOUCH A MOTOR CAR AGAIN CERTAINLY NOT REPLIED TOAD EMPHATICALLY ON THE CONTRARY
0176-122025-0029 VERY WELL THEN SAID THE BADGER FIRMLY RISING TO HIS FEET SINCE YOU WON'T YIELD TO PERSUASION WE'LL TRY WHAT FORCE CAN DO I FEARED IT WOULD COME TO THIS ALL ALONG
0176-122025-0030 YOU'VE OFTEN ASKED US THREE TO COME AND STAY WITH YOU TOAD IN THIS HANDSOME HOUSE OF YOURS WELL NOW WE'RE GOING TO WHEN WE'VE CONVERTED YOU TO A PROPER POINT OF VIEW WE MAY QUIT BUT NOT BEFORE TAKE HIM UPSTAIRS YOU TWO AND LOCK HIM UP IN HIS BEDROOM
0176-122025-0031 WHILE WE ARRANGE MATTERS BETWEEN OURSELVES IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD TOADY YOU KNOW SAID THE RAT KINDLY AS TOAD KICKING AND STRUGGLING WAS HAULED UP THE STAIRS BY HIS TWO FAITHFUL FRIENDS
0176-122025-0032 SAID THE RAT AS THEY THRUST HIM INTO HIS BEDROOM
0176-122025-0033 ADDED THE MOLE TURNING THE KEY ON HIM THEY DESCENDED THE STAIR TOAD SHOUTING ABUSE AT THEM THROUGH THE KEYHOLE AND THE THREE FRIENDS THEN MET IN CONFERENCE ON THE SITUATION IT'S GOING TO BE A TEDIOUS BUSINESS SAID THE BADGER SIGHING
0176-122025-0034 I'VE NEVER SEEN TOAD SO DETERMINED
0176-122025-0035 HE MUST NEVER BE LEFT AN INSTANT UNGUARDED WE SHALL HAVE TO TAKE IT IN TURNS TO BE WITH HIM TILL THE POISON HAS WORKED ITSELF OUT OF HIS SYSTEM THEY ARRANGED WATCHES ACCORDINGLY
0176-123269-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN BOLDLY DOWN THE CRATER
0176-123269-0001 THE BED WAS HARD THE SHELTER NOT VERY SUBSTANTIAL
0176-123269-0002 I ROSE FROM MY GRANITE BED AND WENT OUT TO ENJOY THE MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE THAT LAY UNROLLED BEFORE ME I STOOD ON THE VERY SUMMIT OF THE SOUTHERNMOST OF SNAEFELL'S PEAKS THE RANGE OF THE EYE EXTENDED OVER THE WHOLE ISLAND
0176-123269-0003 BY AN OPTICAL LAW WHICH OBTAINS AT ALL GREAT HEIGHTS THE SHORES SEEMED RAISED AND THE CENTRE DEPRESSED IT SEEMED AS IF ONE OF HELBESMER'S RAISED MAPS LAY AT MY FEET
0176-123269-0004 PRECIPICES LIKE LOW WALLS LAKES REDUCED TO PONDS RIVERS ABBREVIATED INTO STREAMS ON MY RIGHT WERE NUMBERLESS GLACIERS AND INNUMERABLE PEAKS SOME PLUMED WITH FEATHERY CLOUDS OF SMOKE
0176-123269-0005 THE UNDULATING SURFACE OF THESE ENDLESS MOUNTAINS CRESTED WITH SHEETS OF SNOW REMINDED ONE OF A STORMY SEA IF I LOOKED WESTWARD THERE THE OCEAN LAY SPREAD OUT IN ALL ITS MAGNIFICENCE
0176-123269-0006 LIKE A MERE CONTINUATION OF THOSE FLOCK LIKE SUMMITS THE EYE COULD HARDLY TELL WHERE THE SNOWY RIDGES ENDED AND THE FOAMING WAVES BEGAN I WAS THUS STEEPED IN THE MARVELLOUS ECSTASY WHICH ALL HIGH SUMMITS DEVELOP IN THE MIND
0176-123269-0007 THE FANCIFUL CREATION OF SCANDINAVIAN SUPERSTITIONS I FELT INTOXICATED WITH THE SUBLIME PLEASURE OF LOFTY ELEVATIONS WITHOUT THINKING OF THE PROFOUND ABYSSES INTO WHICH I WAS SHORTLY TO BE PLUNGED
0176-123269-0008 BUT I WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE REALITIES OF THINGS BY THE ARRIVAL OF HANS AND THE PROFESSOR WHO JOINED ME ON THE SUMMIT MY UNCLE POINTED OUT TO ME IN THE FAR WEST A LIGHT STEAM OR MIST A SEMBLANCE OF LAND WHICH BOUNDED THE DISTANT HORIZON OF WATERS
0176-123269-0009 GREENLAND SAID HE GREENLAND I CRIED YES
0176-123269-0010 AND DURING THAWS THE WHITE BEARS
0176-123269-0011 ARE CARRIED EVEN INTO ICELAND
0176-123269-0012 HERE WE ARE AT THE TOP OF SNAEFELL AND HERE ARE TWO PEAKS
0176-123269-0013 THE QUESTION BEING PUT HANS REPLIED SCARTARIS MY UNCLE SHOT A TRIUMPHANT GLANCE AT ME NOW FOR THE CRATER HE CRIED THE CRATER OF SNAEFELL RESEMBLED AN INVERTED CONE THE OPENING OF WHICH MIGHT BE HALF A LEAGUE IN DIAMETER
0176-123269-0014 ITS DEPTH APPEARED TO BE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET IMAGINE THE ASPECT OF SUCH A RESERVOIR BRIM FULL AND RUNNING OVER WITH LIQUID FIRE AMID THE ROLLING THUNDER THE BOTTOM OF THE FUNNEL WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FEET IN CIRCUIT
0176-123269-0016 TO GO DOWN INTO A MORTAR PERHAPS A LOADED MORTAR TO BE SHOT UP INTO THE AIR AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
0176-123269-0017 RUSHED BOUNDING DOWN THE ABYSS AND IN THEIR FALL AWOKE ECHOES REMARKABLE FOR THEIR LOUD AND WELL DEFINED SHARPNESS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CONE THERE WERE GLACIERS HERE HANS ADVANCED ONLY WITH EXTREME PRECAUTION
0176-123269-0018 SOUNDING HIS WAY WITH HIS IRON POINTED POLE TO DISCOVER ANY CREVASSES IN IT
0176-123269-0019 IN ORDER THAT ANY MAN WHO MISSED HIS FOOTING MIGHT BE HELD UP BY HIS COMPANIONS THIS SOLID FORMATION WAS PRUDENT BUT DID NOT REMOVE ALL DANGER YET NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE DESCENT DOWN STEEPS UNKNOWN TO THE GUIDE
0176-123269-0020 I RAISED MY HEAD AND SAW STRAIGHT ABOVE ME THE UPPER APERTURE OF THE CONE FRAMING A BIT OF SKY OF VERY SMALL CIRCUMFERENCE BUT ALMOST PERFECTLY ROUND
0176-123269-0021 I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO LOOK DOWN EITHER OF THEM BUT PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK HAD HASTILY SURVEYED ALL THREE HE WAS PANTING RUNNING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER GESTICULATING AND UTTERING INCOHERENT EXPRESSIONS HANS AND HIS COMRADES
0176-123269-0022 SEATED UPON LOOSE LAVA ROCKS LOOKED AT HIM WITH AS MUCH WONDER AS THEY KNEW HOW TO EXPRESS AND PERHAPS TAKING HIM FOR AN ESCAPED LUNATIC SUDDENLY MY UNCLE UTTERED A CRY I THOUGHT HIS FOOT MUST HAVE SLIPPED AND THAT HE HAD FALLEN DOWN ONE OF THE HOLES
0176-123269-0023 BUT NO I SAW HIM WITH ARMS OUTSTRETCHED AND LEGS STRADDLING WIDE APART ERECT BEFORE A GRANITE ROCK THAT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE CRATER JUST LIKE A PEDESTAL MADE READY TO RECEIVE A STATUE OF PLUTO
0176-123269-0024 HANS AND THE ICELANDERS NEVER STIRRED
0176-123269-0025 CRIED THE PROFESSOR AND SHARING HIS ASTONISHMENT BUT I THINK NOT HIS JOY I READ ON THE WESTERN FACE OF THE BLOCK IN RUNIC CHARACTERS HALF MOULDERED AWAY WITH LAPSE OF AGES
0176-123269-0026 AT THIS POINT A RUNIC TEXT APPEARS
0176-123269-0027 THAT ON RAISING MY HEAD AGAIN I SAW ONLY MY UNCLE AND HANS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER THE ICELANDERS HAD BEEN DISMISSED
0176-123269-0028 HANS SLEPT PEACEABLY AT THE FOOT OF A ROCK IN A LAVA BED WHERE HE HAD FOUND A SUITABLE COUCH FOR HIMSELF BUT MY UNCLE WAS PACING AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE I HAD NEITHER THE WISH NOR THE STRENGTH TO RISE
0176-123269-0029 THE NEXT MORNING A GREY HEAVY CLOUDY SKY SEEMED TO DROOP OVER THE SUMMIT OF THE CONE I DID NOT KNOW THIS FIRST FROM THE APPEARANCES OF NATURE BUT I FOUND IT OUT BY MY UNCLE'S IMPETUOUS WRATH
0176-123269-0030 I SOON FOUND OUT THE CAUSE AND HOPE DAWNED AGAIN IN MY HEART FOR THIS REASON OF THE THREE WAYS OPEN BEFORE US ONE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY SAKNUSSEMM THE INDICATIONS OF THE LEARNED ICELANDER HINTED AT IN THE CRYPTOGRAM
0176-123269-0031 POINTED TO THIS FACT THAT THE SHADOW OF SCARTARIS CAME TO TOUCH THAT PARTICULAR WAY DURING THE LATTER DAYS OF THE MONTH OF JUNE THAT SHARP PEAK MIGHT HENCE BE CONSIDERED AS THE GNOMON OF A VAST SUN DIAL
0176-123269-0032 THE SHADOW PROJECTED FROM WHICH ON A CERTAIN DAY WOULD POINT OUT THE ROAD TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH NOW NO SUN NO SHADOW AND THEREFORE NO GUIDE HERE WAS JUNE TWENTY FIFTH
0176-123269-0033 IF THE SUN WAS CLOUDED FOR SIX DAYS WE MUST POSTPONE OUR VISIT TILL NEXT YEAR MY LIMITED POWERS OF DESCRIPTION WOULD FAIL WERE I TO ATTEMPT A PICTURE OF THE PROFESSOR'S ANGRY IMPATIENCE
0176-123269-0034 THE DAY WORE ON AND NO SHADOW CAME TO LAY ITSELF ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER HANS DID NOT MOVE FROM THE SPOT HE HAD SELECTED YET HE MUST BE ASKING HIMSELF WHAT WERE WE WAITING FOR IF HE ASKED HIMSELF ANYTHING AT ALL
0176-123269-0035 HANS BUILT A HUT OF PIECES OF LAVA I FELT A MALICIOUS PLEASURE IN WATCHING THE THOUSAND RILLS AND CASCADES THAT CAME TUMBLING DOWN THE SIDES OF THE CONE
0176-123269-0036 MY UNCLE'S RAGE KNEW NO BOUNDS IT WAS ENOUGH TO IRRITATE A MEEKER MAN THAN HE FOR IT WAS FOUNDERING ALMOST WITHIN THE PORT BUT HEAVEN NEVER SENDS UNMIXED GRIEF
0176-123269-0037 AND FOR PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK THERE WAS A SATISFACTION IN STORE PROPORTIONED TO HIS DESPERATE ANXIETIES
0176-123269-0038 BUT ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF JUNE THE LAST DAY BUT ONE OF THE MONTH WITH THE CHANGE OF THE MOON CAME A CHANGE OF WEATHER THE SUN POURED A FLOOD OF LIGHT DOWN THE CRATER EVERY HILLOCK
0176-123269-0039 MY UNCLE TURNED TOO AND FOLLOWED IT AT NOON BEING AT ITS LEAST EXTENT IT CAME AND SOFTLY FELL UPON THE EDGE OF THE MIDDLE CHIMNEY THERE IT IS
0176-123270-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN VERTICAL DESCENT NOW BEGAN OUR REAL JOURNEY HITHERTO OUR TOIL HAD OVERCOME ALL DIFFICULTIES NOW DIFFICULTIES WOULD SPRING UP AT EVERY STEP
0176-123270-0001 THE SUPREME HOUR HAD COME I MIGHT NOW EITHER SHARE IN THE ENTERPRISE OR REFUSE TO MOVE FORWARD BUT I WAS ASHAMED TO RECOIL IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HUNTER HANS ACCEPTED THE ENTERPRISE WITH SUCH CALMNESS SUCH INDIFFERENCE
0176-123270-0002 SUCH PERFECT DISREGARD OF ANY POSSIBLE DANGER THAT I BLUSHED AT THE IDEA OF BEING LESS BRAVE THAN HE
0176-123270-0003 BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GUIDE I HELD MY PEACE MY HEART FLEW BACK TO MY SWEET VIRLANDAISE AND I APPROACHED THE CENTRAL CHIMNEY I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT IT WAS A HUNDRED FEET IN DIAMETER AND THREE HUNDRED FEET ROUND
0176-123270-0004 MY HAIR STOOD ON END WITH TERROR THE BEWILDERING FEELING OF VACUITY LAID HOLD UPON ME I FELT MY CENTRE OF GRAVITY SHIFTING ITS PLACE AND GIDDINESS MOUNTING INTO MY BRAIN LIKE DRUNKENNESS
0176-123270-0005 I WAS JUST ABOUT TO DROP DOWN WHEN A HAND LAID HOLD OF ME IT WAS THAT OF HANS
0176-123270-0006 A ROPE FASTENED TO THE EDGE OF THE APERTURE MIGHT HAVE HELPED US DOWN BUT HOW WERE WE TO UNFASTEN IT WHEN ARRIVED AT THE OTHER END MY UNCLE EMPLOYED A VERY SIMPLE EXPEDIENT TO OBVIATE THIS DIFFICULTY HE UNCOILED A CORD OF THE THICKNESS OF A FINGER
0176-123270-0007 AND FOUR HUNDRED FEET LONG FIRST HE DROPPED HALF OF IT DOWN THEN HE PASSED IT ROUND A LAVA BLOCK THAT PROJECTED CONVENIENTLY AND THREW THE OTHER HALF DOWN THE CHIMNEY EACH OF US COULD THEN DESCEND BY HOLDING WITH THE HAND BOTH HALVES OF THE ROPE
0176-123270-0008 EACH OF US WILL STRAP ONE UPON HIS BACK I MEAN ONLY FRAGILE ARTICLES OF COURSE WE WERE NOT INCLUDED UNDER THAT HEAD HANS SAID HE
0176-123270-0009 BUT SAID I THE CLOTHES AND THAT MASS OF LADDERS AND ROPES WHAT IS TO BECOME OF THEM
0176-123270-0010 HOW SO I ASKED YOU WILL SEE PRESENTLY MY UNCLE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO EMPLOY MAGNIFICENT RESOURCES OBEYING ORDERS HANS TIED ALL THE NON FRAGILE ARTICLES IN ONE BUNDLE CORDED THEM FIRMLY
0176-123270-0011 AND SENT THEM BODILY DOWN THE GULF BEFORE US I LISTENED TO THE DULL THUDS OF THE DESCENDING BALE MY UNCLE LEANING OVER THE ABYSS FOLLOWED THE DESCENT OF THE LUGGAGE WITH A SATISFIED NOD AND ONLY ROSE ERECT WHEN HE HAD QUITE LOST SIGHT OF IT
0176-123270-0012 NOW IT IS OUR TURN NOW I ASK ANY SENSIBLE MAN IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HEAR THOSE WORDS WITHOUT A SHUDDER THE PROFESSOR FASTENED HIS PACKAGE OF INSTRUMENTS UPON HIS SHOULDERS HANS TOOK THE TOOLS I TOOK THE ARMS
0176-123270-0013 AND THE DESCENT COMMENCED IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER HANS MY UNCLE AND MYSELF IT WAS EFFECTED IN PROFOUND SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY THE DESCENT OF LOOSENED STONES DOWN THE DARK GULF
0176-123270-0014 I DROPPED AS IT WERE FRANTICALLY CLUTCHING THE DOUBLE CORD WITH ONE HAND AND BUTTRESSING MYSELF FROM THE WALL WITH THE OTHER BY MEANS OF MY STICK ONE IDEA OVERPOWERED ME ALMOST FEAR LEST THE ROCK SHOULD GIVE WAY FROM WHICH I WAS HANGING
0176-123270-0015 THIS CORD SEEMED A FRAGILE THING FOR THREE PERSONS TO BE SUSPENDED FROM I MADE AS LITTLE USE OF IT AS POSSIBLE PERFORMING WONDERFUL FEATS OF EQUILIBRIUM UPON THE LAVA PROJECTIONS WHICH MY FOOT SEEMED TO CATCH HOLD OF LIKE A HAND
0176-123270-0016 WHEN ONE OF THESE SLIPPERY STEPS SHOOK UNDER THE HEAVIER FORM OF HANS HE SAID IN HIS TRANQUIL VOICE
0176-123270-0017 IN HALF AN HOUR WE WERE STANDING UPON THE SURFACE OF A ROCK JAMMED IN ACROSS THE CHIMNEY FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER HANS PULLED THE ROPE BY ONE OF ITS ENDS THE OTHER ROSE IN THE AIR
0176-123270-0018 LEANING OVER THE EDGE OF OUR NARROW STANDING GROUND I OBSERVED THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE WAS STILL INVISIBLE THE SAME MANOEUVRE WAS REPEATED WITH THE CORD AND HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE HAD DESCENDED ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED FEET
0176-123270-0019 I DON'T SUPPOSE THE MADDEST GEOLOGIST UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE STUDIED THE NATURE OF THE ROCKS THAT WE WERE PASSING I AM SURE I DID TROUBLE MY HEAD ABOUT THEM
0176-123270-0020 CARBONIFEROUS DEVONIAN SILURIAN OR PRIMITIVE WAS ALL ONE TO ME BUT THE PROFESSOR NO DOUBT WAS PURSUING HIS OBSERVATIONS OR TAKING NOTES FOR IN ONE OF OUR HALTS HE SAID TO ME THE FARTHER I GO THE MORE CONFIDENCE I FEEL
0176-123270-0021 THE ORDER OF THESE VOLCANIC FORMATIONS AFFORDS THE STRONGEST CONFIRMATION TO THE THEORIES OF DAVY
0176-123270-0022 I REPUDIATE THE NOTION OF CENTRAL HEAT ALTOGETHER
0176-123270-0023 NO VARIATION ALWAYS THE SAME CONCLUSION
0176-123270-0024 MY SILENCE WAS TAKEN FOR CONSENT AND THE DESCENT WENT ON ANOTHER THREE HOURS AND I SAW NO BOTTOM TO THE CHIMNEY YET WHEN I LIFTED MY HEAD I PERCEIVED THE GRADUAL CONTRACTION OF ITS APERTURE ITS WALLS BY A GENTLE INCLINE WERE DRAWING CLOSER TO EACH OTHER
0176-123270-0025 AND IT WAS BEGINNING TO GROW DARKER STILL WE KEPT DESCENDING IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE FALLING STONES WERE MEETING WITH AN EARLIER RESISTANCE AND THAT THE CONCUSSION GAVE A MORE ABRUPT AND DEADENED SOUND
0176-123270-0026 WHICH I KNEW THAT WE HAD REPEATED FOURTEEN TIMES EACH DESCENT OCCUPYING HALF AN HOUR THE CONCLUSION WAS EASY THAT WE HAD BEEN SEVEN HOURS PLUS FOURTEEN QUARTERS OF REST MAKING TEN HOURS AND A HALF WE HAD STARTED AT ONE IT MUST THEREFORE NOW BE ELEVEN O'CLOCK
0176-123270-0027 I STOPPED SHORT JUST AS I WAS GOING TO PLACE MY FEET UPON MY UNCLE'S HEAD
0176-123270-0028 WE WILL SEE ABOUT THAT TO MORROW LET US HAVE OUR SUPPER AND GO TO SLEEP THE DARKNESS WAS NOT YET COMPLETE THE PROVISION CASE WAS OPENED WE REFRESHED OURSELVES AND WENT TO SLEEP AS WELL AS WE COULD UPON A BED OF STONES AND LAVA FRAGMENTS
0176-123270-0029 WHEN LYING ON MY BACK I OPENED MY EYES AND SAW A BRIGHT SPARKLING POINT OF LIGHT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE GIGANTIC TUBE THREE THOUSAND FEET LONG NOW A VAST TELESCOPE IT WAS A STAR WHICH SEEN FROM THIS DEPTH
0176-123270-0030 HAD LOST ALL SCINTILLATION AND WHICH BY MY COMPUTATION SHOULD BE FORTY SIX URSA MINOR
0176-123271-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE WONDERS OF TERRESTRIAL DEPTHS AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING A RAY OF DAYLIGHT CAME TO WAKE US UP THE THOUSAND SHINING SURFACES OF LAVA ON THE WALLS RECEIVED IT ON ITS PASSAGE AND SCATTERED IT LIKE A SHOWER OF SPARKS
0176-123271-0001 THERE WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO DISTINGUISH SURROUNDING OBJECTS WELL AXEL WHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT CRIED MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS DID YOU EVER SPEND A QUIETER NIGHT IN OUR LITTLE HOUSE AT KOENIGSBERG
0176-123271-0002 NO CRIES OF BASKET WOMEN NO BOATMEN SHOUTING
0176-123271-0003 THERE IS SOMETHING ALARMING IN THE QUIETNESS ITSELF NOW COME MY UNCLE CRIED IF YOU ARE FRIGHTENED ALREADY
0176-123271-0004 IN FACT THE MERCURY WHICH HAD RISEN IN THE INSTRUMENT AS FAST AS WE DESCENDED HAD STOPPED AT TWENTY NINE INCHES YOU SEE SAID THE PROFESSOR
0176-123271-0005 WE SHALL DESCEND AT A SLOW RATE AND OUR LUNGS WILL BECOME INURED TO A DENSER ATMOSPHERE AERONAUTS FIND THE WANT OF AIR AS THEY RISE TO HIGH ELEVATIONS BUT WE SHALL PERHAPS HAVE TOO MUCH
0176-123271-0006 I THEN REMEMBERED THAT WE HAD SEARCHED FOR IT IN VAIN THE EVENING BEFORE MY UNCLE QUESTIONED HANS WHO AFTER HAVING EXAMINED ATTENTIVELY WITH THE EYE OF A HUNTSMAN REPLIED
0176-123271-0007 AND SO IT WAS THE BUNDLE HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY A PROJECTION A HUNDRED FEET ABOVE US IMMEDIATELY THE ICELANDER CLIMBED UP LIKE A CAT AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE PACKAGE WAS IN OUR POSSESSION NOW SAID MY UNCLE LET US BREAKFAST
0176-123271-0008 BUT WE MUST LAY IN A GOOD STOCK FOR WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE MAY HAVE TO GO ON THE BISCUIT AND EXTRACT OF MEAT WERE WASHED DOWN WITH A DRAUGHT OF WATER MINGLED WITH A LITTLE GIN BREAKFAST OVER MY UNCLE DREW FROM HIS POCKET A SMALL NOTEBOOK
0176-123271-0009 INTENDED FOR SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATIONS HE CONSULTED HIS INSTRUMENTS AND RECORDED
0176-123271-0010 SO SAYING MY UNCLE TOOK IN ONE HAND RUHMKORFF'S APPARATUS WHICH WAS HANGING FROM HIS NECK AND WITH THE OTHER HE FORMED AN ELECTRIC COMMUNICATION WITH THE COIL IN THE LANTERN AND A SUFFICIENTLY BRIGHT LIGHT DISPERSED THE DARKNESS OF THE PASSAGE
0176-123271-0011 HANS CARRIED THE OTHER APPARATUS WHICH WAS ALSO PUT INTO ACTION THIS INGENIOUS APPLICATION OF ELECTRICITY WOULD ENABLE US TO GO ON FOR A LONG TIME BY CREATING AN ARTIFICIAL LIGHT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST INFLAMMABLE GASES NOW MARCH CRIED MY UNCLE
0176-123271-0012 EACH SHOULDERED HIS PACKAGE HANS DROVE BEFORE HIM THE LOAD OF CORDS AND CLOTHES
0176-123271-0013 I RAISED MY HEAD AND SAW FOR THE LAST TIME THROUGH THE LENGTH OF THAT VAST TUBE THE SKY OF ICELAND WHICH I WAS NEVER TO BEHOLD AGAIN THE LAVA IN THE LAST ERUPTION OF TWELVE TWENTY NINE HAD FORCED A PASSAGE THROUGH THIS TUNNEL
0176-123271-0014 IT STILL LINED THE WALLS WITH A THICK AND GLISTENING COAT THE ELECTRIC LIGHT WAS HERE INTENSIFIED A HUNDREDFOLD BY REFLECTION THE ONLY DIFFICULTY IN PROCEEDING LAY IN NOT SLIDING TOO FAST DOWN AN INCLINE OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE DEGREES
0176-123271-0015 HAPPILY CERTAIN ASPERITIES AND A FEW BLISTERINGS HERE AND THERE FORMED STEPS AND WE DESCENDED LETTING OUR BAGGAGE SLIP BEFORE US FROM THE END OF A LONG ROPE BUT THAT WHICH FORMED STEPS UNDER OUR FEET BECAME STALACTITES OVERHEAD
0176-123271-0016 IT IS MAGNIFICENT I CRIED SPONTANEOUSLY MY UNCLE WHAT A SIGHT DON'T YOU ADMIRE THOSE BLENDING HUES OF LAVA PASSING FROM REDDISH BROWN TO BRIGHT YELLOW BY IMPERCEPTIBLE SHADES AND THESE CRYSTALS ARE JUST LIKE GLOBES OF LIGHT
0176-123271-0017 THIS GAVE REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT OUR DESCENT WAS MORE HORIZONTAL THAN VERTICAL AS FOR THE EXACT DEPTH REACHED IT WAS VERY EASY TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE PROFESSOR MEASURED ACCURATELY THE ANGLES OF DEVIATION AND INCLINATION ON THE ROAD BUT HE KEPT THE RESULTS TO HIMSELF
0176-123271-0018 ABOUT EIGHT IN THE EVENING HE SIGNALLED TO STOP HANS SAT DOWN AT ONCE THE LAMPS WERE HUNG UPON A PROJECTION IN THE LAVA WE WERE IN A SORT OF CAVERN WHERE THERE WAS PLENTY OF AIR CERTAIN PUFFS OF AIR REACHED US
0176-123271-0019 WHAT ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WAS THE CAUSE OF THEM I COULD NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION AT THE MOMENT HUNGER AND FATIGUE MADE ME INCAPABLE OF REASONING A DESCENT OF SEVEN HOURS CONSECUTIVELY IS NOT MADE WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE EXPENDITURE OF STRENGTH I WAS EXHAUSTED
0176-123271-0020 THE ORDER TO HALT THEREFORE GAVE ME PLEASURE HANS LAID OUR PROVISIONS UPON A BLOCK OF LAVA AND WE ATE WITH A GOOD APPETITE BUT ONE THING TROUBLED ME OUR SUPPLY OF WATER WAS HALF CONSUMED
0176-123271-0021 MY UNCLE RECKONED UPON A FRESH SUPPLY FROM SUBTERRANEAN SOURCES BUT HITHERTO WE HAD MET WITH NONE I COULD NOT HELP DRAWING HIS ATTENTION TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE
0176-123271-0022 MORE THAN THAT I AM ANXIOUS ABOUT IT WE HAVE ONLY WATER ENOUGH FOR FIVE DAYS
0176-123271-0023 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE HAVE MADE NO GREAT PROGRESS VERTICALLY WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT
0176-123271-0024 ACCORDING TO YOUR SYSTEM SAID MY UNCLE
0176-123271-0025 THIS IS MY CONCLUSION ACCORDING TO EXACT OBSERVATIONS THE INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE IN THE INTERIOR OF THE GLOBE ADVANCES AT THE RATE OF ONE DEGREE
0176-123271-0026 MOREOVER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF AN EXTINCT VOLCANO THROUGH GNEISS
0176-123271-0027 LET US THEREFORE ASSUME THIS LAST HYPOTHESIS AS THE MOST SUITABLE TO OUR SITUATION AND CALCULATE
0176-123271-0028 DO CALCULATE MY BOY NOTHING IS EASIER SAID I PUTTING DOWN FIGURES IN MY NOTE BOOK NINE TIMES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET GIVES A DEPTH OF ELEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET VERY ACCURATE INDEED WELL
0176-123271-0029 IS THAT POSSIBLE YES OR FIGURES ARE OF NO USE THE PROFESSOR'S CALCULATIONS WERE QUITE CORRECT
0176-123271-0030 SUCH AS THE MINES OF KITZ BAHL IN TYROL AND THOSE OF WUTTEMBOURG IN BOHEMIA
0188-135249-0000 THERE WAS MORE EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR OF GREEN GABLES THAN THERE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE IN ALL ITS HISTORY EVEN MARILLA WAS SO EXCITED THAT SHE COULDN'T HELP SHOWING IT WHICH WAS LITTLE SHORT OF BEING PHENOMENAL
0188-135249-0001 AND HIS WIFE HAD A BABY HERE BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN A WEDDING BEFORE IT DOES SEEM SO STRANGE TO THINK OF ANNE BEING MARRIED IN A WAY SHE JUST SEEMS TO ME THE LITTLE GIRL MATTHEW BROUGHT HOME HERE FOURTEEN YEARS AGO
0188-135249-0002 I CAN'T REALIZE THAT SHE'S GROWN UP I SHALL NEVER FORGET WHAT I FELT WHEN I SAW MATTHEW BRINGING IN A GIRL
0188-135249-0003 I WONDER WHAT HIS FATE WAS WELL IT WAS A FORTUNATE MISTAKE SAID MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE THOUGH MIND YOU THERE WAS A TIME I DIDN'T THINK SO THAT EVENING I CAME UP TO SEE ANNE AND SHE TREATED US TO SUCH A SCENE
0188-135249-0004 I'M GOING TO GIVE ANNE TWO OF MY COTTON WARP SPREADS SHE RESUMED A TOBACCO STRIPE ONE AND AN APPLE LEAF ONE SHE TELLS ME THEY'RE GETTING TO BE REAL FASHIONABLE AGAIN
0188-135249-0005 WELL FASHION OR NO FASHION I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING PRETTIER FOR A SPARE ROOM BED THAN A NICE APPLE LEAF SPREAD THAT'S WHAT I MUST SEE ABOUT GETTING THEM BLEACHED I'VE HAD THEM SEWED UP IN COTTON BAGS EVER SINCE THOMAS DIED
0188-135249-0006 AND NO DOUBT THEY'RE AN AWFUL COLOR BUT THERE'S A MONTH YET AND DEW BLEACHING WILL WORK WONDERS ONLY A MONTH MARILLA SIGHED AND THEN SAID PROUDLY I'M GIVING ANNE THAT HALF DOZEN BRAIDED RUGS I HAVE IN THE GARRET
0188-135249-0007 I NEVER SUPPOSED SHE'D WANT THEM THEY'RE SO OLD FASHIONED AND NOBODY SEEMS TO WANT ANYTHING BUT HOOKED MATS NOW BUT SHE ASKED ME FOR THEM SAID SHE'D RATHER HAVE THEM THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR HER FLOORS THEY ARE PRETTY
0188-135249-0008 I MADE THEM OF THE NICEST RAGS AND BRAIDED THEM IN STRIPES IT WAS SUCH COMPANY THESE LAST FEW WINTERS
0188-135249-0009 IT SEEMS REAL STRANGE
0188-135249-0010 AND I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE CUT DOWN AND THIS LAST SPRING THEY WERE WHITE AND SUCH A CROP OF PLUMS I NEVER REMEMBER AT GREEN GABLES
0188-135249-0011 IT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS PRAYED FOR SAID MISSUS RACHEL IN THE TONE OF ONE WHO IS COMFORTABLY SURE THAT HER PRAYERS HAVE AVAILED MUCH IT WAS A GREAT RELIEF TO FIND OUT THAT SHE REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO TAKE THE KINGSPORT MAN
0188-135249-0012 HE WAS RICH TO BE SURE AND GILBERT IS POOR AT LEAST TO BEGIN WITH BUT THEN HE'S AN ISLAND BOY HE'S GILBERT BLYTHE SAID MARILLA CONTENTEDLY MARILLA WOULD HAVE DIED THE DEATH BEFORE SHE WOULD HAVE
0188-135249-0013 PUT INTO WORDS THE THOUGHT THAT WAS ALWAYS IN THE BACKGROUND OF HER MIND WHENEVER SHE HAD LOOKED AT GILBERT FROM HIS CHILDHOOD UP THE THOUGHT THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HER OWN WILFUL PRIDE LONG LONG AGO HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HER SON
0188-135249-0014 MARILLA FELT THAT IN SOME STRANGE WAY HIS MARRIAGE WITH ANNE WOULD PUT RIGHT THAT OLD MISTAKE GOOD HAD COME OUT OF THE EVIL OF THE ANCIENT BITTERNESS AS FOR ANNE HERSELF SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE ALMOST FELT FRIGHTENED
0188-135249-0015 THE GODS SO SAYS THE OLD SUPERSTITION DO NOT LIKE TO BEHOLD TOO HAPPY MORTALS IT IS CERTAIN AT LEAST THAT SOME HUMAN BEINGS DO NOT
0188-135249-0016 TWO OF THAT ILK DESCENDED UPON ANNE ONE VIOLET DUSK AND PROCEEDED TO DO WHAT IN THEM LAY TO PRICK THE RAINBOW BUBBLE OF HER SATISFACTION IF SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GETTING ANY PARTICULAR PRIZE IN YOUNG DOCTOR BLYTHE
0188-135249-0017 IT WAS SURELY THEIR DUTY TO PUT THE MATTER BEFORE HER IN ANOTHER LIGHT YET THESE TWO WORTHY LADIES WERE NOT ENEMIES OF ANNE ON THE CONTRARY THEY WERE REALLY QUITE FOND OF HER
0188-135249-0018 HUMAN NATURE IS NOT OBLIGED TO BE CONSISTENT
0188-135249-0019 CAME WITH HER MOTHER AND MISSUS JASPER BELL BUT IN JANE THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS HAD NOT BEEN CURDLED BY YEARS OF MATRIMONIAL BICKERINGS HER LINES HAD FALLEN IN PLEASANT PLACES IN SPITE OF THE FACT AS MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WOULD SAY
0188-135249-0020 HER MARRIAGE HAD BEEN HAPPY WEALTH HAD NOT SPOILED HER SHE WAS STILL THE PLACID AMIABLE PINK CHEEKED JANE OF THE OLD QUARTETTE SYMPATHISING WITH HER OLD CHUM'S HAPPINESS AND AS KEENLY INTERESTED IN ALL THE DAINTY DETAILS OF ANNE'S TROUSSEAU
0188-135249-0021 JANE WAS NOT BRILLIANT AND HAD PROBABLY NEVER MADE A REMARK WORTH LISTENING TO IN HER LIFE BUT SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING THAT WOULD HURT ANYONE'S FEELINGS WHICH MAY BE A NEGATIVE TALENT BUT IS LIKEWISE A RARE AND ENVIABLE ONE
0188-135249-0022 SO GILBERT DIDN'T GO BACK ON YOU AFTER ALL SAID MISSUS HARMON ANDREWS CONTRIVING TO CONVEY AN EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE IN HER TONE
0188-135249-0023 RED HAIR IS VERY FASHIONABLE NOW SAID ANNE TRYING TO SMILE BUT SPEAKING RATHER COLDLY LIFE HAD DEVELOPED IN HER A SENSE OF HUMOR WHICH HELPED HER OVER MANY DIFFICULTIES
0188-135249-0024 BUT AS YET NOTHING HAD AVAILED TO STEEL HER AGAINST A REFERENCE TO HER HAIR SO IT IS SO IT IS CONCEDED MISSUS HARMON THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT QUEER FREAKS FASHION WILL TAKE
0188-135249-0025 I HOPE YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY YOU HAVE MY BEST WISHES I'M SURE A LONG ENGAGEMENT DOESN'T OFTEN TURN OUT WELL BUT OF COURSE IN YOUR CASE IT COULDN'T BE HELPED
0188-135249-0026 GILBERT LOOKS VERY YOUNG FOR A DOCTOR I'M AFRAID PEOPLE WON'T HAVE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM SAID MISSUS JASPER BELL GLOOMILY THEN SHE SHUT HER MOUTH TIGHTLY AS IF SHE HAD SAID WHAT SHE CONSIDERED IT HER DUTY TO SAY AND HELD HER CONSCIENCE CLEAR
0188-135249-0027 SHE BELONGED TO THE TYPE WHICH ALWAYS HAS A STRINGY BLACK FEATHER IN ITS HAT AND STRAGGLING LOCKS OF HAIR ON ITS NECK ANNE'S SURFACE PLEASURE IN HER PRETTY BRIDAL THINGS WAS TEMPORARILY SHADOWED
0188-135249-0028 BUT THE DEEPS OF HAPPINESS BELOW COULD NOT THUS BE DISTURBED AND THE LITTLE STINGS OF MESDAMES BELL AND ANDREWS WERE FORGOTTEN WHEN GILBERT CAME LATER AND THEY WANDERED DOWN TO THE BIRCHES OF THE BROOK WHICH HAD BEEN SAPLINGS WHEN ANNE HAD COME TO GREEN GABLES
0188-135249-0029 BUT WERE NOW TALL IVORY COLUMNS IN A FAIRY PALACE OF TWILIGHT AND STARS IN THEIR SHADOWS ANNE AND GILBERT TALKED IN LOVER FASHION OF THEIR NEW HOME AND THEIR NEW LIFE TOGETHER I'VE FOUND A NEST FOR US ANNE OH WHERE

0188-136483-0035 BUT HER EYES WERE TROUBLED THE DOCTOR WAS OPENLY NERVOUS AND IMPATIENT MISS POLLY SAID LITTLE BUT EVEN THE SOFTENING WAVES OF HAIR ABOUT HER FACE AND THE BECOMING LACES AT HER THROAT COULD NOT HIDE THE FACT
0188-136483-0036 THAT SHE WAS GROWING THIN AND PALE AS TO POLLYANNA POLLYANNA PETTED THE DOG SMOOTHED THE CAT'S SLEEK HEAD ADMIRED THE FLOWERS AND ATE THE FRUITS AND JELLIES THAT WERE SENT IN TO HER
0188-136483-0037 AND RETURNED INNUMERABLE CHEERY ANSWERS TO THE MANY MESSAGES OF LOVE AND INQUIRY THAT WERE BROUGHT TO HER BEDSIDE BUT SHE TOO GREW PALE AND THIN AND THE NERVOUS ACTIVITY OF THE POOR LITTLE HANDS AND ARMS
0188-136483-0038 ONLY EMPHASIZED THE PITIFUL MOTIONLESSNESS OF THE ONCE ACTIVE LITTLE FEET AND LEGS NOW LYING SO WOEFULLY QUIET UNDER THE BLANKETS AS TO THE GAME POLLYANNA TOLD NANCY THESE DAYS HOW GLAD SHE WAS GOING TO BE
0188-141613-0000 THIS TIME BELDINGSVILLE DID NOT LITERALLY WELCOME POLLYANNA HOME WITH BRASS BANDS AND BUNTING PERHAPS BECAUSE THE HOUR OF HER EXPECTED ARRIVAL WAS KNOWN TO BUT FEW OF THE TOWNSPEOPLE
0188-141613-0001 BUT THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO LACK OF JOYFUL GREETINGS ON THE PART OF EVERYBODY FROM THE MOMENT SHE STEPPED FROM THE RAILWAY TRAIN WITH HER AUNT POLLY AND DOCTOR CHILTON NOR DID POLLYANNA LOSE ANY TIME
0188-141613-0002 IN STARTING ON A ROUND OF FLY AWAY MINUTE CALLS ON ALL HER OLD FRIENDS INDEED FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS ACCORDING TO NANCY THERE WASN'T NO PUTTING OF YOUR FINGER ON HER ANYWHERES
0188-141613-0003 SHE WA'N'T THERE AND ALWAYS EVERYWHERE SHE WENT POLLYANNA MET THE QUESTION WELL HOW DID YOU LIKE BOSTON PERHAPS TO NO ONE DID SHE ANSWER THIS MORE FULLY THAN SHE DID TO MISTER PENDLETON
0188-141613-0005 NO THERE'S PARTS OF IT OH I WAS GLAD TO BE THERE SHE EXPLAINED HASTILY I HAD A PERFECTLY LOVELY TIME AND LOTS OF THINGS WERE SO QUEER AND DIFFERENT YOU KNOW
0188-141613-0006 LIKE EATING DINNER AT NIGHT INSTEAD OF NOONS WHEN YOU OUGHT TO EAT IT BUT EVERYBODY WAS SO GOOD TO ME AND I SAW SUCH A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS BUNKER HILL AND THE PUBLIC GARDEN AND THE SEEING BOSTON AUTOS
0188-141613-0007 AND MILES OF PICTURES AND STATUES AND STORE WINDOWS AND STREETS THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY END AND FOLKS I NEVER SAW SUCH A LOT OF FOLKS WELL I'M SURE
0188-141613-0008 I THOUGHT YOU LIKED FOLKS COMMENTED THE MAN I DO POLLYANNA FROWNED AGAIN AND PONDERED BUT WHAT'S THE USE OF SUCH A LOT OF THEM IF YOU DON'T KNOW EM AND MISSUS CAREW WOULDN'T LET ME
0188-141613-0009 SHE DIDN'T KNOW EM HERSELF SHE SAID FOLKS DIDN'T DOWN THERE THERE WAS A SLIGHT PAUSE THEN WITH A SIGH POLLYANNA RESUMED
0188-141613-0010 I RECKON MAYBE THAT'S THE PART I DON'T LIKE THE MOST THAT FOLKS DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER IT WOULD BE SUCH A LOT NICER IF THEY DID WHY JUST THINK MISTER PENDLETON THERE ARE LOTS OF FOLKS THAT LIVE ON DIRTY NARROW STREETS
0188-141613-0011 AND HAVE MORE THINGS TO EAT AND WEAR THAN THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH NOW IF THOSE FOLKS ONLY KNEW THE OTHER FOLKS BUT MISTER PENDLETON INTERRUPTED WITH A LAUGH MY DEAR CHILD DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
0188-141613-0012 THAT THESE PEOPLE DON'T CARE TO KNOW EACH OTHER HE ASKED QUIZZICALLY OH BUT SOME OF THEM DO MAINTAINED POLLYANNA IN EAGER DEFENSE
0188-141613-0013 SHE SELLS BOWS LOVELY BOWS IN A BIG STORE SHE WANTS TO KNOW PEOPLE AND I INTRODUCED HER TO MISSUS CAREW AND WE HAD HER UP TO THE HOUSE AND WE HAD JAMIE AND LOTS OF OTHERS THERE TOO AND SHE WAS SO GLAD TO KNOW THEM
0188-141613-0014 AND THAT'S WHAT MADE ME THINK THAT IF ONLY A LOT OF MISSUS CAREW'S KIND COULD KNOW THE OTHER KIND BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T DO THE INTRODUCING I DIDN'T KNOW MANY OF THEM MYSELF ANYWAY BUT IF THEY COULD KNOW EACH OTHER
0188-141613-0015 SO THAT THE RICH PEOPLE COULD GIVE THE POOR PEOPLE PART OF THEIR MONEY BUT AGAIN MISTER PENDLETON INTERRUPTED WITH A LAUGH OH POLLYANNA POLLYANNA HE CHUCKLED I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GETTING INTO PRETTY DEEP WATER
0188-141613-0016 I'D LIKE TO BE ONE I DON'T DOUBT IT POLLYANNA SMILED THE MAN BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SCHEME OF YOURS FOR THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM ON YOUR HANDS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH
0188-141613-0017 BRIDLED THE LITTLE GIRL AGGRIEVEDLY AS THE MAN BEGAN TO LAUGH AND ANYWAY I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOME FOLKS SHOULD HAVE SUCH A LOT AND OTHER FOLKS SHOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING AND I DON'T LIKE IT
0188-141613-0018 SURRENDERED AND LAUGHED WITH HIM WELL ANYWAY SHE REITERATED WHEN SHE HAD CAUGHT HER BREATH I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ALL THE SAME NO DEAR I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T AGREED THE MAN
0188-141613-0019 IN TALKING OF JAMIE POLLYANNA LOST HER WORRIED BAFFLED LOOK POLLYANNA LOVED TO TALK OF JAMIE HERE WAS SOMETHING SHE UNDERSTOOD HERE WAS NO PROBLEM
0188-141613-0020 THAT HAD TO DEAL WITH BIG FEARSOME SOUNDING WORDS BESIDES IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE WOULD NOT MISTER PENDLETON BE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN MISSUS CAREW'S TAKING THE BOY INTO HER HOME
0188-141613-0021 FOR WHO BETTER THAN HIMSELF COULD UNDERSTAND THE NEED OF A CHILD'S PRESENCE FOR THAT MATTER POLLYANNA TALKED TO EVERYBODY ABOUT JAMIE SHE ASSUMED THAT EVERYBODY WOULD BE AS INTERESTED AS SHE HERSELF WAS

0192-128345-0047 HE KNOWS THAT A WOOD SAWYER LIVING BY THE PRISON WALL IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE DEFARGES AND HAS BEEN REHEARSED BY MADAME DEFARGE AS TO HIS HAVING SEEN HER HE NEVER MENTIONED LUCIE'S NAME MAKING SIGNS AND SIGNALS TO PRISONERS

0192-128345-0050 YOU KNOW IT IS A CAPITAL CRIME TO MOURN FOR OR SYMPATHISE WITH A VICTIM OF THE GUILLOTINE SHE AND HER FATHER WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY BE GUILTY OF THIS CRIME AND THIS WOMAN THE INVETERACY OF WHOSE PURSUIT CANNOT BE DESCRIBED

0192-128345-0059 THOUGH HE SAID IT WITH A GRAVE SMILE OF EARNESTNESS AND THOUGH HE EVEN PUT THE OLD MAN'S HAND TO HIS LIPS HE DID NOT PART FROM HIM THEN HE HELPED HIM SO FAR TO AROUSE THE ROCKING FIGURE BEFORE THE DYING EMBERS AS TO GET A CLOAK AND HAT PUT UPON IT
0192-128345-0060 AND TO TEMPT IT FORTH TO FIND WHERE THE BENCH AND WORK WERE HIDDEN THAT IT STILL MOANINGLY BESOUGHT TO HAVE HE WALKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND PROTECTED IT TO THE COURTYARD OF THE HOUSE WHERE THE AFFLICTED HEART SO HAPPY IN THE MEMORABLE TIME
0192-128345-0061 WHEN HE HAD REVEALED HIS OWN DESOLATE HEART TO IT OUTWATCHED THE AWFUL NIGHT HE ENTERED THE COURTYARD AND REMAINED THERE FOR A FEW MOMENTS ALONE LOOKING UP AT THE LIGHT IN THE WINDOW OF HER ROOM BEFORE HE WENT AWAY HE BREATHED A BLESSING TOWARDS IT
0329-861-0000 CHAPTER NINE THE SIEGE OF HENNEBON THE BESIEGERS OF HENNEBON WERE GREATLY DISCOURAGED AT THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE OF THE COUNTESS THEY HAD ALREADY ATTEMPTED SEVERAL DESPERATE ASSAULTS
0329-861-0001 BUT HAD EACH TIME BEEN REPULSED WITH VERY HEAVY LOSS THEY NOW SENT TO RENNES FOR TWELVE OF THE IMMENSE MACHINES USED IN BATTERING WALLS WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND THERE ON A FALSE REPORT OF THE WEAKNESS OF HENNEBON
0329-861-0002 IN A FEW DAYS THESE ARRIVED AND WERE SPEEDILY SET TO WORK AND IMMENSE MASSES OF STONE WERE HURLED AT THE WALLS WALTER CONTINUED TO ACT AS THE COUNTESS'S ESPECIAL SQUIRE SHE HAD INFORMED SIR WILLIAM CADDOUDAL
0329-861-0003 AND SIR JOHN POWIS THAT IT WAS AT HIS SUGGESTION THAT SHE HAD MADE THE SUDDEN ATTACK UPON THE FRENCH CAMP AND HE HAD GAINED GREAT CREDIT THEREBY THE EFFECT OF THE NEW MACHINES WAS SPEEDILY VISIBLE
0329-861-0004 THE WALLS CRUMBLED UNDER THE TREMENDOUS BLOWS AND ALTHOUGH THE ARCHERS HARASSED BY THEIR ARROWS THE MEN WORKING THEM THE FRENCH SPEEDILY ERECTED SCREENS WHICH SHELTERED THEM FROM THEIR FIRE THE SPIRITS OF THE DEFENDERS BEGAN TO SINK RAPIDLY
0329-861-0005 AS THEY SAW THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME GREAT BREACHES WOULD BE MADE IN THE WALLS AND THAT ALL THE HORRORS AND DISASTERS OF A CITY TAKEN BY ASSAULT AWAITED THEM THE BISHOP OF QUIMPER WHO WAS WITHIN THE WALLS ENTERED INTO SECRET NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIS NEPHEW
0329-861-0006 WHO HAD GONE OVER TO THE ENEMY
0329-861-0007 AND WAS NOW WITH THE BESIEGING ARMY THE BESIEGERS DELIGHTED TO FIND AN ALLY WITHIN THE WALLS WHO MIGHT SAVE THEM FROM THE HEAVY LOSSES WHICH AN ASSAULT WOULD ENTAIL UPON THEM AT ONCE EMBRACED HIS OFFERS AND PROMISED HIM A LARGE RECOMPENSE
0329-861-0008 IF HE WOULD BRING OVER THE OTHER COMMANDERS AND NOBLES THE WILY BISHOP SET TO WORK AND THE CONSEQUENCES WERE SOON VISIBLE OPEN GRUMBLING BROKE FORTH AT THE HARDSHIPS WHICH WERE ENDURED
0329-861-0009 AND AT THE PROSPECT OF THE WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER WHICH WOULD ATTEND A STORM WHEN ALL HOPE OF A SUCCESSFUL RESISTANCE WAS AT AN END I FEAR WALTER SIR JOHN SAID ONE MORNING THAT THE END IS AT HAND
0329-861-0010 AND ALL THAT I CAN SAY TO KEEP UP THEIR SPIRITS IS USELESS UPON OUR OWN LITTLE BAND WE CAN RELY BUT I DOUBT IF OUTSIDE THEM A SINGLE DETERMINED MAN IS TO BE FOUND IN THE TOWN IN VAIN DO I SPEAK OF THE ARRIVAL OF SIR WALTER MANNY
0329-861-0011 NEARLY NINETY DAYS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE WE SAILED AND ALL HOPE OF HIS COMING IS GONE I POINT OUT TO THEM THAT CONTRARY WINDS HAVE BEEN BLOWING AND THAT AT ANY MOMENT HE MAY ARRIVE BUT THEY WILL NOT HEAR ME
0329-861-0012 THE BISHOP HAS GAINED OVER THE WHOLE OF THEM BY HIS PROMISES THAT NONE SHALL BE MOLESTED IN PROPERTY OR ESTATE SHOULD THEY SURRENDER IT IS SAD TO SEE THE COUNTESS WALTER REPLIED SHE WHO HAS SHOWN SUCH HIGH SPIRIT THROUGHOUT THE SIEGE
0329-861-0013 NOW DOES NOTHING BUT WEEP FOR SHE KNOWS THAT WITH HER AND HER CHILD IN THE HANDS OF THE FRENCH THE CAUSE OF THE COUNT IS LOST IF SHE COULD CARRY OFF THE CHILD BY SEA SHE WOULD NOT SO MUCH CARE FOR THE FALL OF THE TOWN BUT THE FRENCH SHIPS LIE THICK ROUND THE PORT

0329-861-0015 WHO SUMMONED THE TOWN TO SURRENDER MANY STANDING ON THE WALLS SHOUTED THAT THE GATES SHOULD BE THROWN OPEN BUT SIR JOHN RETURNED FOR ANSWER THAT HE MUST CONSULT THE COUNTESS AND THAT UPON HER ANSWER MUST DEPEND WHETHER HE AND HIS MEN WOULD DEFEND THE BREACH UNTIL THE LAST
0329-861-0016 COME WITH ME WALTER HE SAID WE MUST FAIN PERSUADE THE COUNTESS IF SHE SAYS NO WE ENGLISHMEN WILL DIE IN THE BREACH BUT THOUGH READY TO GIVE MY LIFE FOR SO BRAVE A LADY I OWN THAT IT IS USELESS TO FIGHT LONGER
0329-861-0017 SAVE OUR OWN LITTLE BAND NOT ONE IN THE TOWN WILL LIFT A SWORD AGAIN SUCH RESISTANCE AS WE CAN OFFER WILL BUT INFLAME THEM TO FURY AND ALL THE HORRORS OF A SACK WILL BE INFLICTED UPON THE INHABITANTS THERE SHE IS POOR LADY ON THE TURRET
0329-861-0018 GAZING AS USUAL SEAWARD SUDDENLY THEY SAW HER THROW UP HER ARMS AND THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE CITY SHE CRIED AS SHE PERCEIVED THE ENGLISH KNIGHT I SEE THEM I SEE THEM THE ENGLISH FLEET ARE COMING RUN UP WALTER

0329-861-0024 WHO WERE FAST APPROACHING THEIR SHIPS IMPELLED BY A STRONG AND FAVOURABLE BREEZE THE VESSELS OF THE FRENCH HASTILY DREW OFF AND THE ENGLISH FLEET SAILED INTO THE PORT HAILED BY THE CHEERS OF THE INHABITANTS THE COUNTESS HERSELF RECEIVED SIR WALTER MANNY
0329-861-0025 ON HIS LANDING AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN OFFERING HOSPITALITY TO THE MEN AT ARMS AND ARCHERS AH SIR JOHN POWIS SIR WALTER EXCLAIMED WHAT

0329-861-0029 AND STOOD BY ME AND TO WHOSE SUGGESTIONS I OWE IT THAT I WAS ABLE AT THE FIRST TO SALLY OUT AND DESTROY THE FRENCH CAMP WHILE THEY WERE ATTACKING THE WALLS AND SO GREATLY HINDERED THEIR MEASURES AGAINST THE TOWN AND NOW SIR WILL YOU FOLLOW ME

0329-861-0031 THAT EVENING THERE WAS HIGH FEASTING IN THE TOWN ALTHOUGH THE CRASH OF THE HEAVY STONES CAST BY THE FRENCH MACHINES AGAINST THE WALLS NEVER CEASED EARLY THE NEXT MORNING SIR WALTER MANNY MADE A SURVEY OF THE PLACE AND OF THE DISPOSITION OF THE ENEMY
0329-861-0032 AND PROPOSED TO HIS KNIGHTS TO SALLY FORTH AT ONCE AND DESTROY THE LARGEST OF THE ENEMY'S MACHINES WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP CLOSE TO THE WALLS IN A FEW MINUTES THE KNIGHTS WERE ARMED AND MOUNTED THREE HUNDRED KNIGHTS AND ESQUIRES WERE TO TAKE PART IN THE SORTIE
0329-861-0033 THEY WERE TO BE FOLLOWED BY A STRONG BODY OF MEN AT ARMS AS SOON AS THE GATES WERE OPENED A NUMBER OF ARCHERS ISSUED OUT AND TAKING THEIR PLACE AT THE EDGE OF THE MOAT POURED A RAIN OF ARROWS UPON THE MEN WORKING THE MACHINE AND THOSE GUARDING IT MOST OF THESE
0329-861-0034 CUT DOWN ALL WHO OPPOSED THEM AND SETTING FIRE TO THE HUTS RETIRED TOWARDS THE CITY BY THIS TIME THE FRENCH WERE THOROUGHLY ALARMED AND NUMBERS OF KNIGHTS AND MEN AT ARMS DASHED AFTER THE LITTLE BODY OF ENGLISH CAVALRY
0329-861-0035 AND MANY ON BOTH SIDES WERE OVERTHROWN THEN AS LARGE REINFORCEMENTS WERE CONTINUALLY ARRIVING TO THE FRENCH SIR WALTER CALLED OFF HIS MEN AND RETIRED SLOWLY ON REACHING THE MOAT HE HALTED HIS FORCES
0329-861-0036 THE KNIGHTS WHEELED AND PRESENTED A FIRM FACE TO THE ENEMY COVERING THE ENTRANCE OF THEIR FOLLOWERS INTO THE GATE THE FRENCH CHIVALRY THUNDERED DOWN UPON THE LITTLE BODY
0329-861-0037 MANY KNIGHTS WERE STRUCK THROUGH THE BARS OF THEIR VIZORS OR THE JOINTS OF THEIR MAIL THE HORSES THOUGH DEFENDED BY IRON TRAPPINGS
0329-861-0038 THE ARRIVAL OF THE REINFORCEMENTS AND THE PROOF OF SKILL AND VIGOUR GIVEN BY THE ENGLISH LEADER TOGETHER WITH THE TERROR CAUSED BY THE TERRIBLE EFFECT OF THE ENGLISH ARROWS SHOOK THE RESOLUTION OF DON LOUIS AND HIS TROOPS
0329-862-0000 CHAPTER TEN A PLACE OF REFUGE THE FRENCH EXCITED TO THE UTMOST BY THE EXHORTATIONS OF THEIR COMMANDERS AND BY THEIR DESIRE TO WIPE OUT THE DISGRACE
0329-862-0001 ADVANCED WITH ARDOUR TO THE ASSAULT AND OFFICERS AND MEN VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN THE VALOUR WHICH THEY DISPLAYED IN VAIN DID THE GARRISON SHOWER ARROWS AND CROSS BOW BOLTS AMONG THEM AND POUR DOWN BURNING OIL AND QUICKLIME UPON THEM
0329-862-0002 WHO SHOT SUCH A STORM OF BOLTS THAT GREAT NUMBERS OF THE DEFENDERS WERE KILLED THE ASSAULT WAS MADE AT A SCORE OF DIFFERENT POINTS AND THE GARRISON WAS TOO WEAK TO DEFEND ALL WITH SUCCESS
0329-862-0003 SIR JOHN POWIS AND HIS PARTY REPULSED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE EFFORTS OF THE ASSAILANTS AGAINST THAT PART OF THE WALL ENTRUSTED TO THEM BUT AT OTHER POINTS THE FRENCH GAINED A FOOTING AND SWARMING UP RUSHED ALONG THE WALLS

0329-862-0005 EVERY HOUSE WAS CLOSED AND BARRED AND FROM THE UPPER WINDOWS THE BURGHERS HURLED DOWN STONES AND BRICKS UPON THE FUGITIVES WHILE PARTIES OF THE FRENCH SOLDIERS FELL UPON THEM FIERCELY MANY THREW DOWN THEIR ARMS AND CRIED FOR QUARTER BUT WERE INSTANTLY SLAIN
0329-862-0006 SOME TRIED IN VAIN TO GAIN SHELTER IN THE HOUSES SIR JOHN POWIS'S BAND WAS SOON BROKEN AND SCATTERED AND THEIR LEADER SLAIN BY A HEAVY STONE FROM A HOUSETOP WALTER FOUGHT HIS WAY BLINDLY FORWARD TOWARDS THE CASTLE
0329-862-0007 THEY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THEIR ASSAILANTS AND DASHED IN AT THE CASTLE GATE A CROWD OF THEIR ASSAILANTS WERE CLOSE UPON THEIR HEELS WALTER GLANCED ROUND DASHING ACROSS THE COURTYARD HE RAN THROUGH SOME PASSAGES INTO AN INNER YARD IN WHICH AS HE KNEW WAS THE WELL
0329-862-0008 THE BUCKET HUNG AT THE WINDLASS CATCH HOLD RALPH HE EXCLAIMED
0329-862-0009 WITH GREAT EFFORTS THEY MANAGED TO RID THEMSELVES OF THEIR ARMOUR AND THEN HELD ON WITH EASE TO THE ROPE THEY HAULED THE BUCKET TO THE SURFACE AND TIED A KNOT IN THE SLACK OF THE ROPE SO THAT THE BUCKET HUNG FOUR FEET BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE WATER
0329-862-0010 I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS WELL TO HAVE BEEN KILLED AT ONCE THEY ARE SURE TO FIND US HERE AND IF THEY DON'T WE SHALL DIE OF COLD BEFORE TOMORROW MORNING I DON'T THINK THEY WILL FIND US WALTER SAID CHEERFULLY
0329-862-0011 WHEN THEY HAVE SEARCHED THE CASTLE THOROUGHLY IT MAY OCCUR TO SOME OF THEM THAT WE HAVE JUMPED DOWN THE WELL BUT IT WILL BE NO PARTICULAR BUSINESS OF ANYONE TO LOOK FOR US AND THEY WILL ALL BE TOO ANXIOUS
0329-862-0012 TO GET AT THE WINE BUTTS TO TROUBLE THEIR HEADS ABOUT THE MATTER BESIDES IT MUST BE A HEAVY JOB TO WIND UP THIS BUCKET AND IT IS NOT LIKELY THERE WILL BE SUCH URGENT NEED OF WATER THAT ANYONE WILL UNDERTAKE THE TASK
0329-862-0013 FOR WE MUST DIE HERE IF WE ARE NOT HAULED OUT I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T INTEND TO TRY AND CLIMB THAT ROPE I MIGHT DO TWENTY FEET OR SO ON A PINCH BUT I COULD NO MORE GET UP TO THE TOP THERE THAN I COULD FLY WE
0329-862-0014 WHERE THERE IS A WILL THERE IS A WAY YOU KNOW WE WILL TAKE IT BY TURNS TO WATCH THAT LITTLE PATCH OF LIGHT OVERHEAD
0329-862-0015 AND SWIM TO THE SIDE WITHOUT MAKING THE LEAST NOISE THEY MAY GIVE A FEW TURNS OF THE WINDLASS TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS HOLD OF THE ROPE BELOW BE SURE YOU DO NOT MAKE THE SLIGHTEST SPLASHING OR NOISE FOR THE SOUND WOULD BE HEARD ABOVE
0329-862-0016 THEN THOUGH IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING THEY HEARD THE BUCKET LIFTED FROM THE WATER A MINUTE LATER IT FELL BACK AGAIN WITH A SPLASH
0329-862-0017 THEY ARE SATISFIED THAT IF WE DID JUMP DOWN HERE WE ARE DROWNED AND NOW WE MUST THINK ABOUT CLIMBING UP AYE THAT WILL REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF THINKING RALPH GRUMBLED FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS SILENCE THEN WALTER SAID
0329-862-0018 THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO CUT OFF THE SLACK OF THE ROPE THERE ARE SOME TWELVE FEET OF IT THEN WE WILL UNWIND THE STRANDS OF THAT THERE ARE FIVE OR SIX LARGE STRANDS AS FAR AS I CAN FEEL WE WILL CUT THEM UP INTO LENGTHS OF ABOUT A COUPLE OF FEET
0329-862-0019 AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TIE THESE TO THE ROPE IN SUCH A WAY AS NOT TO SLIP DOWN WITH OUR WEIGHT IF WE TIE THEM FOUR FEET APART
0329-862-0020 NO RALPH SAID MUCH MORE CHEERFULLY
0329-862-0021 BY WHICH IT WOULD NOT SLIP DOWN THE ROPE THEY MADE MANY FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS
0329-862-0022 IT SLID DOWN THE ROPE WHEN THEIR WEIGHT WAS APPLIED TO IT AT LAST THEY SUCCEEDED IN FINDING OUT A KNOT WHICH WOULD HOLD THIS WAS DONE BY TYING A KNOT CLOSE TO ONE END OF A PIECE OF THE STRAND THEN SUFFICIENT WAS LEFT TO FORM THE LOOP
0329-862-0023 THE VIBRATION OF THE ROPE WHEN OUR WEIGHT ONCE GETS ON IT MIGHT BE NOTICED BY ANYONE CROSSING THE COURTYARD DO YOU THINK WE HAVE SUFFICIENT BITS OF ROPE RALPH ASKED JUST ENOUGH I THINK WALTER REPLIED
0329-862-0024 THERE WERE SIX STRANDS AND EACH HAS MADE SIX PIECES SO WE HAVE THIRTY SIX I KNOW THE WELL IS ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET DEEP
0329-862-0025 WHICH WILL LEAVE THREE OVER BUT WE HAD BETTER PLACE THEM A LITTLE OVER A YARD
0329-862-0026 IN A SHORT TIME THE FADING BRIGHTNESS OF THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT FAR OVERHEAD TOLD THEM THAT TWILIGHT HAD COMMENCED AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THEY ATTACHED THE FIRST STRAND TO THE ROPE SOME THREE FEET ABOVE THE WATER NOW WALTER SAID
0329-862-0027 I WILL GO FIRST AT ANY RATE FOR A TIME I MUST PUT ONE LEG THROUGH THE LOOP AND SIT AS IT WERE WHILE I FASTEN THE ONE ABOVE AS I SHALL WANT BOTH HANDS FOR THE WORK YOU WILL FIND IT A GOOD DEAL EASIER TO STAND WITH YOUR FOOT IN THE LOOP
0329-862-0028 IF I GET TIRED I WILL FASTEN ANOTHER LOOP BY THE SIDE OF THAT ON WHICH I AM RESTING SO YOU CAN COME UP AND PASS ME THERE IS NO HURRY IT OUGHT NOT TO TAKE UP ABOVE AN HOUR
0329-862-0029 AND IT WILL NOT DO FOR US TO GET TO THE TOP UNTIL THE PLACE BECOMES A LITTLE QUIET TONIGHT THEY ARE SURE TO BE DRINKING AND FEASTING OVER THEIR VICTORY UNTIL LATE THEY NOW SET TO WORK AND STEP BY STEP MOUNTED THE ROPE
0329-862-0030 THEY FOUND THE WORK LESS ARDUOUS THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED THE ROPE WAS DRY AND THE STRANDS HELD TIGHTLY TO IT TWO OR THREE TIMES THEY CHANGED PLACES RESTING IN TURN FROM THE WORK BUT IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS FROM THE TIME THEY MADE THE FIRST LOOP WALTER'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS
0329-862-0031 APPEARED ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE COURTYARD HE COULD HEAR SOUNDS OF SHOUTING AND SINGING WITHIN THE CASTLE AND KNEW THAT A GREAT FEAST WAS GOING ON DESCENDING A STEP OR TWO HE HELD PARLEY WITH RALPH
0329-862-0032 EVERYONE IS INTENT ON HIS OWN PLEASURE AND WE SHALL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN SLIPPING OUT OF THE CASTLE UNNOTICED
0329-862-0033 BESIDES THE GATES OF THE TOWN WILL STAND OPEN LATE FOR PEOPLE FROM THE VILLAGES ROUND WILL HAVE COME IN TO JOIN IN THE REVELS I AM READY TO TRY IT MASTER WALTER RALPH REPLIED FOR I ACHE FROM HEAD TO FOOT
0329-862-0034 WITH HOLDING ON TO THIS ROPE THE SOONER THE BETTER SAY I IN ANOTHER MINUTE BOTH STOOD IN THE COURTYARD IT WAS A RETIRED SPOT AND NONE WERE PASSING GOING ALONG THE PASSAGE THEY ISSUED INTO THE MAIN YARD HERE GREAT FIRES WERE BLAZING
0329-862-0035 AND GROUPS OF MEN SAT ROUND THEM DRINKING AND SHOUTING MANY LAY ABOUT IN DRUNKEN SLEEP
0329-862-0036 YOU HAD BEST LIE DOWN BY THE FOOT OF THE WALL ANYONE WHO PASSES WILL THINK THAT YOU ARE IN A DRUNKEN SLEEP
0329-862-0037 AND BY DINT OF UNBUCKLING THE CLOAKS AND ROLLING THEIR WEARERS GENTLY OVER WALTER SUCCEEDED AT LAST IN OBTAINING TWO OF THEM HE ALSO PICKED UP A SWORD FOR RALPH HIS OWN STILL HUNG IN ITS SHEATH AND THEN HE JOINED HIS COMPANION
0329-862-0038 AND THE TWO PUTTING ON THE STEEL CAPS AND CLOAKS WALKED QUIETLY TO THE GATE THERE WERE NONE ON GUARD AND THEY ISSUED UNMOLESTED INTO THE TOWN
0329-862-0039 THEN TURNING OFF FROM THE PRINCIPAL STREETS THEY MADE THEIR WAY BY QUIET LANES DOWN TO ONE OF THE GATES TO THEIR DISMAY THEY FOUND THAT THIS WAS CLOSED THE FRENCH COMMANDERS KNEW THAT SIR WALTER MANNY OR SALISBURY
0329-862-0040 TO THE MAIN BODY OF THEIR FORCES THEY HAD PLACED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THEIR BEST TROOPS ON THE WALLS GIVING THEM A HANDSOME LARGESS TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR LOSS OF THE FESTIVITIES
0329-862-0041 AND I CANNOT KEEP OPENING AND CLOSING THE GATE
0329-862-0042 BEFORE THAT TIME ELAPSED SOME FIFTY OR SIXTY PEOPLE ANXIOUS TO RETURN TO THEIR VILLAGES GATHERED ROUND THE GATE BEST LAY ASIDE YOUR STEEL CAP RALPH BEFORE WE JOIN THEM WALTER SAID IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THAT LAMP
0329-862-0043 PRESENTLY THE OFFICER CAME OUT FROM THE GUARD ROOM AGAIN THERE WAS A FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THE LITTLE CROWD AND WALTER AND RALPH CLOSED IN TO THEIR MIDST THE GATES WERE OPENED AND WITHOUT ANY QUESTION THE VILLAGERS PASSED OUT
0329-862-0044 AND THE GATES WERE SHUT INSTANTLY BEHIND THEM WALTER AND HIS COMRADE AT ONCE STARTED AT A BRISK PACE
0329-862-0045 IN THE DIRECTION OF HENNEBON THEIR CLOTHES SOON DRIED AND ELATED AT THEIR ESCAPE FROM DANGER THEY STRUGGLED ON BRISKLY WHEN MORNING BROKE THEY ENTERED A WOOD AND LAY THERE TILL EVENING
0329-862-0046 AS THEY FEARED TO CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY LEST THEY MIGHT FALL INTO THE HANDS OF SOME ROVING BAND OF FRENCH HORSE THEY WERE TOO DOG TIRED AND WERE ASLEEP A FEW MINUTES AFTER THEY LAY DOWN THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THEY AWOKE
0329-862-0047 AND AS SOON AS IT WAS DARK THEY RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL MASTER WALTER BUT I AM WELL NIGH FAMISHED IT IS THIRTY SIX HOURS SINCE I SWALLOWED A BIT OF FOOD
0329-862-0048 JUST AS THE FRENCH WERE MOVING TO THE ATTACK HARD BLOWS I DON'T MIND I HAVE BEEN USED TO IT BUT WHAT WITH FIGHTING AND BEING IN THE WATER FOR FIVE OR SIX HOURS AND CLIMBING UP THAT ENDLESS ROPE
0329-862-0049 AND WALKING ALL NIGHT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH IT DOES NOT SUIT ME AT ALL I FEEL RAVENOUS TOO RALPH
0329-862-0050 WE SHALL EAT NOTHING TILL WE ARE WITHIN THE WALLS OF HENNEBON AND THAT WILL BE BY DAYLIGHT TOMORROW IF ALL GOES WELL DRAW YOUR BELT AN INCH OR TWO TIGHTER IT WILL HELP TO KEEP OUT THE WOLF
0329-862-0051 THAT THEY COULD WITH DIFFICULTY DRAG THEIR LEGS ALONG UPON ENTERING THE TOWN WALTER MADE HIS WAY AT ONCE TO THE QUARTERS OF THE LEADER SIR WALTER HAD JUST RISEN AND WAS DELIGHTED AT THE SIGHT OF HIS ESQUIRE

0329-862-0055 WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HIS HUNGER THE YOUNG ESQUIRE RELATED HIS ADVENTURES TO SIR WALTER AND SEVERAL OTHER KNIGHTS AND NOBLES WHO HAD BY THIS TIME GATHERED IN THE ROOM IN FAITH MASTER SOMERS
0329-862-0056 THAN DROP DOWN INTO THE DEEP HOLE OF THAT WELL AND YOUR BRAINS SERVED YOU SHREWDLY IN DEVISING A METHOD OF ESCAPE WHAT SAY YOU GENTLEMEN ALL PRESENT JOINED IN EXPRESSIONS OF PRAISE AT THE LAD'S COOLNESS AND PRESENCE OF MIND

0329-862-0058 WHEN THE TIME COMES TO BESTOW UPON YOU MYSELF THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD IF OUR KING DOES NOT TAKE THE MATTER OFF MY HANDS A LITTLE LATER ROBERT OF ARTOIS DIED OF HIS WOUNDS AND DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE FAILURE OF HIS HOPES
0329-862-0059 IN OCTOBER KING EDWARD HIMSELF SET SAIL WITH A GREAT ARMY AND LANDING IN BRITTANY EARLY IN NOVEMBER MARCHED FORWARD THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND SOON REDUCED PLOERMEL MALESTRAIL REDON
0329-862-0060 AND THE REST OF THE PROVINCE IN THE VICINITY OF VANNES AND THEN LAID SIEGE TO THAT TOWN AS HIS FORCE WAS FAR MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR THE SIEGE THE EARLS OF NORFOLK AND WARWICK WERE DESPATCHED IN THE DIRECTION OF NANTES
0329-862-0061 TO RECONNOITRE THE COUNTRY AND CLEAR IT OF ANY SMALL BODIES OF THE ENEMY THEY MIGHT ENCOUNTER IN THE MEANTIME EDWARD OPENED NEGOTIATIONS WITH MANY OF THE BRETON LORDS
0329-862-0062 WHO SEEING THAT SUCH POWERFUL AID HAD ARRIVED FOR THE CAUSE OF THE COUNTESS OF MONTFORD WERE EASILY PERSUADED TO CHANGE SIDES AMONG THEM WERE THE LORDS OF CLISSON
0329-862-0063 WHO COMMANDED THE GARRISON OF VANNES SUPPORTED THE SIEGE WITH GREAT COURAGE AND FORTITUDE KNOWING THAT CHARLES OF BLOIS AND THE KING OF FRANCE WERE COLLECTING A GREAT ARMY FOR HIS RELIEF UNITING THEIR FORCES THEY ADVANCED TOWARDS THE TOWN
0329-862-0064 BEFORE THE FORCE OF THE FRENCH FORTY THOUSAND STRONG THE EARL OF NORFOLK HAD FALLEN BACK AND REJOINED THE KING BUT EVEN AFTER THIS JUNCTION THE FRENCH FORCES EXCEEDED THOSE OF EDWARD FOURFOLD THEY ADVANCED TOWARDS VANNES
0329-862-0065 AND FORMED A LARGE ENTRENCHED CAMP NEAR THAT OF THE ENGLISH WHO THUS WHILE STILL BESIEGING VANNES WERE THEMSELVES ENCLOSED BY A VASTLY SUPERIOR FORCE THE KING OF FRANCE HIMSELF ARRIVED AT THE FRENCH CAMP THE FRENCH ALTHOUGH SO GREATLY SUPERIOR
0329-862-0066 WHICH CRUISED OFF THE COAST AND CAPTURED ALL VESSELS ARRIVING WITH STORES AT THIS MOMENT TWO LEGATES
0329-862-0067 AND THE CARDINAL BISHOP OF TUSCULUM ARRIVED FROM THE POPE AND STROVE TO MEDIATE BETWEEN THE TWO SOVEREIGNS AND TO BRING ABOUT A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES POINTING OUT TO THEM
0329-862-0068 THE SCANDAL AND DESOLATION WHICH THEIR RIVALRY CAUSED IN CHRISTENDOM THE WASTE OF NOBLE LIVES THE DEVASTATION OF ONCE HAPPY PROVINCES AND THE EFFUSION OF INNOCENT BLOOD GOING FROM CAMP TO CAMP THEY EXHORTED
0329-862-0069 KING EDWARD HOWEVER FELT THAT HIS POSITION WAS GROWING DESPERATE FOR STARVATION WAS STARING HIM IN THE FACE AND ONLY BY A VICTORY OVER AN IMMENSELY SUPERIOR FORCE IN A STRONGLY ENTRENCHED POSITION COULD HE EXTRICATE HIMSELF
0329-862-0070 UPON THE PART OF THE FRENCH HOWEVER CIRCUMSTANCES WERE OCCURRING WHICH RENDERED THEM ANXIOUS FOR A RELEASE FROM THEIR POSITION
0329-862-0071 WHILE THE ENGLISH ARMY LAY ON A HILL THE FRENCH CAMP WAS PITCHED ON LOW GROUND AN UNUSUALLY WET SEASON HAD SET IN WITH BITTERLY COLD WIND THE RAIN WAS INCESSANT A PESTILENCE HAD DESTROYED A VAST NUMBER OF THEIR HORSES
0329-862-0072 AND THEIR ENCAMPMENT WAS FLOODED THEIR FORCES WERE THEREFORE OBLIGATED TO SPREAD THEMSELVES OVER THE NEIGHBOURING FIELDS AND A SUDDEN ATTACK BY THE ENGLISH MIGHT HAVE BEEN FATAL THUS DISTRESS PRESSED UPON BOTH COMMANDERS
0329-862-0074 AND THE CITY OF VANNES WAS TO BE GIVEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE CARDINALS TO DISPOSE OF AS THEY CHOSE IT WAS SPECIALLY PROVIDED
0329-862-0075 ON THE NINETEENTH OF JANUARY THIRTEEN FORTY THREE THE KING OF FRANCE DISMISSED HIS ARMY AND EDWARD SAILED FOR ENGLAND WITH THE GREATER PART OF HIS TROOPS THE COUNTESS OF MONTFORD AND HER SON ACCOMPANIED HIM AND THE POSSESSIONS OF HER HUSBAND IN BRITTANY
0329-862-0076 WERE LEFT TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF HER PARTISANS WITH A SMALL BUT CHOICE BODY OF ENGLISH TROOPS THE TOWNS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO THEIR HANDS AND STILL REMAINED WERE BREST QUIMPER CORENTIN QUIMPERLE REDON
0329-862-0077 AND HENNEBON OF COURSE REMAINED IN THEIR POSSESSION
0329-862-0078 WHO WERE NEVER TIRED OF LISTENING TO HIS TALES OF THE WARS
0329-862-0079 THE TIME NOW FOR A WHILE PASSED VERY QUIETLY WALTER AND THE OTHER YOUNG SQUIRES PRACTISED DILIGENTLY UNDER THE INSTRUCTIONS OF SIR WALTER AT KNIGHTLY EXERCISES WALTER LEARNED TO BEAR HIMSELF WELL ON HORSEBACK AND TO TILT IN THE RING
0335-125941-0000 THE SCARECROW PLANS AN ESCAPE TIP SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE GIRLS AND FOLLOWED SWIFTLY AFTER THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS
0335-125941-0001 THE INVADING ARMY ENTERED THE CITY MORE SLOWLY FOR THEY STOPPED TO DIG EMERALDS OUT OF THE WALLS AND PAVING STONES WITH THE POINTS OF THEIR KNITTING NEEDLES SO THE SOLDIER AND THE BOY REACHED THE PALACE BEFORE THE NEWS HAD SPREAD THAT THE CITY WAS CONQUERED
0335-125941-0002 THE SCARECROW AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD WERE STILL PLAYING AT QUOITS IN THE COURTYARD WHEN THE GAME WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE ABRUPT ENTRANCE OF THE ROYAL ARMY OF OZ WHO CAME FLYING IN WITHOUT HIS HAT OR GUN
0335-125941-0003 YOUR MAJESTY THE CITY IS CONQUERED GASPED THE ROYAL ARMY WHO WAS ALL OUT OF BREATH THIS IS QUITE SUDDEN SAID THE SCARECROW BUT PLEASE GO AND BAR ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS OF THE PALACE WHILE I SHOW THIS PUMPKINHEAD HOW TO THROW A QUOIT
0335-125941-0004 THE SOLDIER HASTENED TO DO THIS WHILE TIP WHO HAD ARRIVED AT HIS HEELS REMAINED IN THE COURTYARD TO LOOK AT THE SCARECROW WITH WONDERING EYES HIS MAJESTY CONTINUED TO THROW THE QUOITS
0335-125941-0005 AS COOLLY AS IF NO DANGER THREATENED HIS THRONE BUT THE PUMPKINHEAD HAVING CAUGHT SIGHT OF TIP AMBLED TOWARD THE BOY AS FAST AS HIS WOODEN LEGS WOULD GO GOOD AFTERNOON NOBLE PARENT HE CRIED DELIGHTEDLY

0335-125941-0009 FOR NO MAN COULD FACE THE TERRIBLE WEAPONS OF THE INVADERS WELL SAID THE SCARECROW AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT
0335-125941-0010 AND THIS CROWN IS SO HEAVY THAT IT MAKES MY HEAD ACHE BUT I HOPE THE CONQUERORS HAVE NO INTENTION OF INJURING ME JUST BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE THE KING I HEARD THEM SAY REMARKED TIP WITH SOME HESITATION THAT THEY
0335-125941-0011 THEN I AM REALLY IN DANGER DECLARED HIS MAJESTY POSITIVELY AND IT WILL BE WISE FOR ME TO CONSIDER A MEANS TO ESCAPE
0335-125941-0012 IT IS TOO LATE TO ESCAPE THEY WOULD SOON TEAR YOU TO PIECES THE SCARECROW SIGHED IN AN EMERGENCY HE ANNOUNCED IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO PAUSE AND REFLECT
0335-125941-0013 NONSENSE EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW THEY'RE TOO BUSY TO COOK EVEN IF THEY KNOW HOW BUT SHOULD I REMAIN HERE A PRISONER FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME PROTESTED JACK I'M LIABLE TO SPOIL

0335-125941-0016 IF YOU'LL KEEP QUIET LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO THINK I'LL TRY TO FIND SOME WAY FOR US ALL TO ESCAPE
0335-125941-0017 AT THE END OF THAT TIME HE FACED THEM WITH A MORE CHEERFUL EXPRESSION UPON HIS PAINTED FACE WHERE IS THE SAW HORSE YOU RODE HERE HE ASKED THE PUMPKINHEAD
0335-125941-0018 IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE I COULD THINK OF YOUR MAJESTY ADDED THE SOLDIER FEARING HE HAD MADE A BLUNDER IT PLEASES ME VERY MUCH SAID THE SCARECROW HAS THE ANIMAL BEEN FED

0335-125941-0022 I HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN HIS POWERS STILL HE CAN RUN
0335-125941-0023 I EXPECTED THIS BLOW SAID THE SOLDIER SULKILY BUT I CAN BEAR IT I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF BY CUTTING OFF MY LOVELY GREEN WHISKERS AND AFTER ALL
0335-125941-0024 IT IS NO MORE DANGEROUS TO FACE THOSE RECKLESS GIRLS THAN TO RIDE THIS FIERY UNTAMED WOODEN HORSE PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT OBSERVED HIS MAJESTY BUT FOR MY PART NOT BEING A SOLDIER I AM FOND OF DANGER
0335-125941-0025 NOW MY BOY YOU MUST MOUNT FIRST AND PLEASE SIT AS CLOSE TO THE HORSE'S NECK AS POSSIBLE TIP CLIMBED QUICKLY TO HIS PLACE AND THE SOLDIER AND THE SCARECROW MANAGED TO HOIST THE PUMPKINHEAD TO A SEAT JUST BEHIND HIM
0335-125941-0026 THERE REMAINED SO LITTLE SPACE FOR THE KING THAT HE WAS LIABLE TO FALL OFF AS SOON AS THE HORSE STARTED FETCH A CLOTHESLINE SAID THE KING TO HIS ARMY AND TIE US ALL TOGETHER
0335-125941-0027 THEN IF ONE FALLS OFF WE WILL ALL FALL OFF AND WHILE THE SOLDIER WAS GONE FOR THE CLOTHESLINE HIS MAJESTY CONTINUED
0335-125941-0028 NOT EXACTLY REPLIED THE SCARECROW FOR IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO ME
0335-125941-0029 THEY COULD USE YOU FOR SEED THE SOLDIER NOW RETURNED WITH A LONG LINE AND TIED ALL THREE FIRMLY TOGETHER ALSO LASHING THEM TO THE BODY OF THE SAW HORSE SO THERE SEEMED LITTLE DANGER OF THEIR TUMBLING OFF NOW THROW OPEN THE GATES COMMANDED THE SCARECROW
0335-125941-0030 AND WE WILL MAKE A DASH TO LIBERTY OR TO DEATH THE COURTYARD IN WHICH THEY WERE STANDING WAS LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE GREAT PALACE WHICH SURROUNDED IT ON ALL SIDES BUT IN ONE PLACE A PASSAGE LED TO AN OUTER GATEWAY
0335-125941-0031 IT WAS THROUGH THIS GATEWAY HIS MAJESTY PROPOSED TO ESCAPE AND THE ROYAL ARMY NOW LED THE SAW HORSE ALONG THE PASSAGE
0335-125941-0032 OTHERS RAN SCREAMING OUT OF THE WAY AND ONLY ONE OR TWO JABBED THEIR KNITTING NEEDLES FRANTICALLY AT THE ESCAPING PRISONERS
0335-125941-0033 WHICH SMARTED FOR AN HOUR AFTERWARD BUT THE NEEDLES HAD NO EFFECT UPON THE SCARECROW OR JACK PUMPKINHEAD WHO NEVER EVEN SUSPECTED THEY WERE BEING PRODDED AS FOR THE SAW HORSE HE MADE A WONDERFUL RECORD UPSETTING A FRUIT CART
0335-125941-0034 OVERTURNING SEVERAL MEEK LOOKING MEN AND FINALLY BOWLING OVER THE NEW GUARDIAN OF THE GATE A FUSSY LITTLE FAT WOMAN APPOINTED BY GENERAL JINJUR NOR DID THE IMPETUOUS CHARGER STOP THEN
0335-125941-0035 SO THE SAW HORSE CONTINUED HIS WILD CAREER UNCHECKED AND WITH UNABATED SPEED PRESENTLY THEY CAME TO THE BANKS OF A WIDE RIVER
0335-125941-0036 AND WITHOUT A PAUSE THE WOODEN STEED GAVE ONE FINAL LEAP AND LAUNCHED THEM ALL IN MID AIR A SECOND LATER THEY WERE ROLLING SPLASHING AND BOBBING ABOUT IN THE WATER
0335-125943-0000 A NICKEL PLATED EMPEROR TIP AWOKE SOON AFTER DAWN BUT THE SCARECROW HAD ALREADY RISEN AND PLUCKED WITH HIS CLUMSY FINGERS A DOUBLE HANDFUL OF RIPE BERRIES FROM SOME BUSHES NEAR BY
0335-125943-0001 AND AFTERWARD THE LITTLE PARTY RESUMED ITS JOURNEY
0335-125943-0002 SCARECROW BECAME GREATLY ANIMATED AT THIS SIGHT AND EXCLAIMED HOW DELIGHTED I SHALL BE TO SEE MY OLD FRIEND THE TIN WOODMAN AGAIN
0335-125943-0003 DON'T MENTION THAT TO THE TIN WOODMAN EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW EARNESTLY YOU WOULD HURT HIS FEELINGS TERRIBLY HE IS A PROUD MAN AS HE HAS EVERY REASON TO BE AND IT PLEASES HIM TO BE TERMED EMPEROR RATHER THAN KING
0335-125943-0004 I'M SURE IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME REPLIED THE BOY THE SAW HORSE NOW AMBLED FORWARD AT A PACE SO FAST THAT ITS RIDERS HAD HARD WORK TO STICK UPON ITS BACK SO THERE WAS LITTLE FURTHER CONVERSATION
0335-125943-0005 UNTIL THEY DREW UP BESIDE THE PALACE STEPS AN AGED WINKIE DRESSED IN A UNIFORM OF SILVER CLOTH CAME FORWARD TO ASSIST THEM TO ALIGHT SAID THE SCARECROW TO HIS PERSONAGE SHOW US AT ONCE TO YOUR MASTER THE EMPEROR

0335-125943-0009 CAUGHT UP INTO KNOTS AND FASTENED WITH TINY SILVER AXES UPON A HANDSOME CENTER TABLE STOOD A LARGE SILVER OIL CAN RICHLY ENGRAVED WITH SCENES FROM THE PAST ADVENTURES OF THE TIN WOODMAN DOROTHY
0335-125943-0010 THE COWARDLY LION AND THE SCARECROW THE LINES OF THE ENGRAVING BEING TRACED UPON THE SILVER IN YELLOW GOLD ON THE WALLS HUNG SEVERAL PORTRAITS
0335-125943-0011 IN ACT OF PRESENTING THE TIN WOODMAN WITH A HEART COVERED ALMOST ONE ENTIRE END OF THE ROOM WHILE THE VISITORS GAZED AT THESE THINGS IN SILENT ADMIRATION THEY SUDDENLY HEARD A LOUD VOICE IN THE NEXT ROOM EXCLAIM
0335-125943-0012 THE FACE OF THE SCARECROW AND MANY PORTIONS OF HIS BODY BORE GREAT BLOTCHES OF PUTZ POMADE FOR THE TIN WOODMAN IN HIS EAGERNESS TO WELCOME HIS FRIEND HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE CONDITION OF HIS TOILET AND HAD RUBBED THE THICK COATING OF PASTE FROM HIS OWN BODY
0335-125943-0013 TO THAT OF HIS COMRADE DEAR ME SAID THE SCARECROW DOLEFULLY WHAT A MESS I'M IN NEVER MIND MY FRIEND RETURNED THE TIN WOODMAN I'LL SEND YOU TO MY IMPERIAL LAUNDRY AND YOU'LL COME OUT AS GOOD AS NEW

0335-125943-0016 TIP DURING THIS CONVERSATION WAS LOOKING AT THE WOODMAN WITH UNDISGUISED AMAZEMENT AND NOTICED THAT THE CELEBRATED EMPEROR OF THE WINKIES WAS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF PIECES OF TIN
0335-125943-0017 HE RATTLED AND CLANKED A LITTLE AS HE MOVED BUT IN THE MAIN HE SEEMED TO BE MOST CLEVERLY CONSTRUCTED AND HIS APPEARANCE WAS ONLY MARRED BY THE THICK COATING OF POLISHING PASTE THAT COVERED HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT
0335-125943-0018 SO HE BEGGED HIS FRIENDS TO EXCUSE HIM WHILE HE RETIRED TO HIS PRIVATE APARTMENT AND ALLOWED HIS SERVANTS TO POLISH HIM THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN A SHORT TIME AND WHEN THE EMPEROR RETURNED HIS NICKEL PLATED BODY SHONE SO MAGNIFICENTLY
0335-125943-0019 THAT THE SCARECROW HEARTILY CONGRATULATED HIM ON HIS IMPROVED APPEARANCE THAT NICKEL PLATE WAS I CONFESS A HAPPY THOUGHT SAID NICK

0335-125943-0023 AND ARE RUNNING THINGS TO SUIT THEMSELVES DEAR ME WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY IDEA CRIED THE EMPEROR WHO WAS BOTH SHOCKED
0335-125943-0024 HOW LARGE AN ARMY CAN YOU ASSEMBLE WE DO NOT NEED AN ARMY REPLIED THE WOODMAN WE FOUR WITH THE AID OF MY GLEAMING AXE ARE ENOUGH TO STRIKE TERROR INTO THE HEARTS OF THE REBELS WE FIVE CORRECTED THE PUMPKINHEAD FIVE
0335-125943-0025 REPEATED THE TIN WOODMAN YES
0335-125943-0026 THE TIN WOODMAN LOOKED AROUND HIM IN A PUZZLED WAY FOR THE SAW HORSE HAD UNTIL NOW REMAINED QUIETLY STANDING IN A CORNER WHERE THE EMPEROR HAD NOT NOTICED HIM TIP IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE ODD LOOKING CREATURE TO THEM
0335-125943-0027 AND THE ENGRAVED OIL CAN I BEGIN TO THINK
0335-125943-0028 THE SAW HORSE ANSWERED FOR HIMSELF BUT I SEEM TO LEARN VERY QUICKLY AND OFTEN IT OCCURS TO ME THAT I KNOW MORE THAN ANY OF THOSE AROUND ME PERHAPS YOU DO SAID THE EMPEROR FOR EXPERIENCE DOES NOT ALWAYS MEAN WISDOM
0335-125943-0029 BUT TIME IS PRECIOUS JUST NOW SO LET US QUICKLY MAKE PREPARATIONS TO START UPON OUR JOURNEY THE EMPEROR CALLED HIS LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR AND INSTRUCTED HIM HOW TO RUN THE KINGDOM DURING HIS ABSENCE MEANWHILE THE SCARECROW WAS TAKEN APART
0335-125943-0030 AND THE PAINTED SACK THAT SERVED HIM FOR A HEAD WAS CAREFULLY LAUNDERED AND RESTUFFED WITH THE BRAINS ORIGINALLY GIVEN HIM BY THE GREAT WIZARD HIS CLOTHES WERE ALSO CLEANED AND PRESSED BY THE IMPERIAL TAILORS AND HIS CROWN POLISHED AND AGAIN SEWED UPON HIS HEAD
0335-125943-0031 THEN BRIGHT AND EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THEY SET OUT UPON THE RETURN JOURNEY TO THE EMERALD CITY
0335-125945-0000 KNOWING NO BETTER I USED MY ARMS AS WELL AS MY LEGS FOR WALKING AND CRAWLED UNDER THE EDGES OF STONES OR HID AMONG THE ROOTS OF GRASSES WITH NO THOUGHT BEYOND FINDING A FEW INSECTS SMALLER THAN MYSELF TO FEED UPON
0335-125945-0002 YOU MUST REMEMBER IT IS THE REGULAR ORDAINED EXISTENCE OF WOGGLE BUGS
0335-125945-0003 I RESOLVED TO ESTABLISH MY FUTURE HOME BESIDE IT SO I FOUND A CHARMING NEST BETWEEN TWO BRICKS AND HID MYSELF THEREIN FOR MANY MANY MONTHS
0335-125945-0004 PROFESSOR NOWITALL IS DOUBTLESS THE MOST FAMOUS SCHOLAR IN THE LAND OF OZ AND AFTER A FEW DAYS I BEGAN TO LISTEN TO THE LECTURES AND DISCOURSES HE GAVE HIS PUPILS NOT ONE OF THEM WAS MORE ATTENTIVE THAN THE HUMBLE UNNOTICED WOGGLE BUG
0335-125945-0005 AND I ACQUIRED IN THIS WAY A FUND OF KNOWLEDGE THAT I WILL MYSELF CONFESS IS SIMPLY MARVELOUS THAT IS WHY I PLACE T E THOROUGHLY EDUCATED UPON MY CARDS
0335-125945-0006 TO ME SAID THE SAW HORSE A GOOD LEG IS MORE DESIRABLE THAN EITHER
0335-125945-0007 KEEP QUIET COMMANDED TIP STERNLY VERY WELL DEAR FATHER ANSWERED THE OBEDIENT JACK THE WOGGLE BUG LISTENED PATIENTLY EVEN RESPECTFULLY TO THESE REMARKS AND THEN RESUMED HIS STORY
0335-125945-0008 I MUST HAVE LIVED FULLY THREE YEARS IN THAT SECLUDED SCHOOL HOUSE HEARTH SAID HE DRINKING THIRSTILY OF THE EVER FLOWING FOUNT OF LIMPID KNOWLEDGE BEFORE ME QUITE POETICAL
0335-125945-0009 SAID HE I HAVE CAPTURED A WOGGLE BUG A VERY RARE AND INTERESTING SPECIMEN DO ANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT A WOGGLE BUG IS NO YELLED THE SCHOLARS IN CHORUS THEN SAID THE PROFESSOR
0335-125945-0010 I WILL GET OUT MY FAMOUS MAGNIFYING GLASS AND THROW THE INSECT UPON A SCREEN IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED CONDITION THAT YOU MAY ALL STUDY CAREFULLY ITS PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION
0335-125945-0011 IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED STATE EVEN AS YOU NOW BEHOLD ME THE STUDENTS STOOD UP ON THEIR STOOLS AND CRANED THEIR HEADS FORWARD TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF ME AND TWO LITTLE GIRLS JUMPED UPON THE SILL OF AN OPEN WINDOW WHERE THEY COULD SEE MORE PLAINLY BEHOLD
0335-125945-0012 CRIED THE PROFESSOR IN A LOUD VOICE THIS HIGHLY MAGNIFIED WOGGLE BUG
0335-125945-0013 FOR ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS PERCHED UPON THE WINDOW SILL GAVE A SCREAM AND FELL BACKWARD OUT THE WINDOW DRAWING HER COMPANION WITH HER AS SHE DISAPPEARED THE PROFESSOR UTTERED A CRY OF HORROR AND RUSHED AWAY THROUGH THE DOOR TO SEE IF THE POOR CHILDREN WERE INJURED BY THE FALL
0335-125945-0014 THE SCHOLARS FOLLOWED AFTER HIM IN A WILD MOB AND I WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE SCHOOL ROOM STILL IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED STATE AND FREE TO DO AS I PLEASED IT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO ME
0335-125945-0015 I WAS PROUD OF MY GREAT SIZE AND REALIZED THAT NOW I COULD SAFELY TRAVEL ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHILE MY SUPERIOR CULTURE WOULD MAKE ME A FIT ASSOCIATE FOR THE MOST LEARNED PERSON I MIGHT CHANCE TO MEET SO WHILE THE PROFESSOR PICKED THE LITTLE GIRLS
0335-125945-0016 WHO WERE MORE FRIGHTENED THAN HURT OFF THE GROUND AND THE PUPILS CLUSTERED AROUND HIM CLOSELY GROUPED I CALMLY WALKED OUT OF THE SCHOOL HOUSE TURNED A CORNER AND ESCAPED UNNOTICED
0335-125945-0017 THAT INSECTS WORE CLOTHES NOR DO THEY IN THEIR NATURAL STATE RETURNED THE STRANGER BUT IN THE COURSE OF MY WANDERINGS I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SAVE THE NINTH LIFE OF A TAILOR
0335-125945-0018 TAILORS HAVING LIKE CATS NINE LIVES AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE FELLOW WAS EXCEEDINGLY GRATEFUL FOR HAD HE LOST THAT NINTH LIFE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF HIM SO HE BEGGED PERMISSION TO FURNISH ME WITH THE STYLISH COSTUME I NOW WEAR
0335-125945-0019 IT FITS VERY NICELY DOES IT NOT AND THE WOGGLE BUG STOOD UP AND TURNED HIMSELF AROUND SLOWLY
0335-125945-0020 NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR WAS THE REPLY ALTHOUGH IT IS MY INTENTION SOON TO VISIT THE EMERALD CITY

0335-125945-0022 BUT PARDON ME IF I SEEM INQUISITIVE
0335-125945-0023 ASKED THE WOGGLE BUG LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WITH UNCONCEALED INTEREST NOT MORE SO THAN YOURSELF ANSWERED THE SCARECROW EVERYTHING IN LIFE IS UNUSUAL UNTIL YOU GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT WHAT RARE PHILOSOPHY
0335-125945-0024 EXCLAIMED THE WOGGLE BUG ADMIRINGLY YES MY BRAINS ARE WORKING WELL TODAY ADMITTED THE SCARECROW AN ACCENT OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE THEN
0335-125945-0025 LET US BEND OUR STEPS TOWARD THE EMERALD CITY
0335-125945-0026 WHY NOT USE ONE OF HIS LEGS TO MAKE A LEG FOR THE HORSE THAT CARRIES HIM I JUDGE THAT BOTH ARE MADE OF WOOD NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL REAL CLEVERNESS SAID THE SCARECROW APPROVINGLY I WONDER MY BRAINS DID NOT THINK OF THAT LONG AGO
0335-125945-0027 GET TO WORK MY DEAR NICK AND FIT THE PUMPKINHEAD'S LEG TO THE SAW HORSE JACK WAS NOT ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THIS IDEA BUT HE SUBMITTED TO HAVING HIS LEFT LEG AMPUTATED BY THE TIN WOODMAN AND WHITTLED DOWN TO FIT THE LEFT LEG OF THE SAW HORSE
0335-125945-0028 NOR WAS THE SAW HORSE ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THE OPERATION EITHER FOR HE GROWLED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT BEING BUTCHERED AS HE CALLED IT AND AFTERWARD DECLARED THAT THE NEW LEG WAS A DISGRACE TO A RESPECTABLE SAW HORSE
0335-125945-0029 I BEG YOU TO BE MORE CAREFUL IN YOUR SPEECH SAID THE PUMPKINHEAD SHARPLY REMEMBER IF YOU PLEASE THAT IT IS MY LEG YOU ARE ABUSING I CANNOT FORGET IT RETORTED THE SAW HORSE
0335-125945-0030 AS A MATTER OF FACT WE ARE NONE OF US ABOVE CRITICISM SO LET US BEAR WITH EACH OTHERS FAULTS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION SAID THE WOGGLE BUG APPROVINGLY YOU MUST HAVE AN EXCELLENT HEART MY METALLIC FRIEND I HAVE
0335-125945-0031 RETURNED NICK WELL PLEASED MY HEART IS QUITE THE BEST PART OF ME BUT NOW LET US START UPON OUR JOURNEY THEY PERCHED THE ONE LEGGED PUMPKINHEAD UPON THE SAW HORSE AND TIED HIM TO HIS SEAT WITH CORDS
0335-125951-0000 DOCTOR NIKIDIK'S FAMOUS WISHING PILLS THE TIN WOODMAN WAS USUALLY A PEACEFUL MAN BUT WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED HE COULD FIGHT AS FIERCELY AS A ROMAN GLADIATOR
0335-125951-0001 SO WHEN THE JACKDAWS NEARLY KNOCKED HIM DOWN IN THEIR RUSH OF WINGS AND THEIR SHARP BEAKS AND CLAWS THREATENED TO DAMAGE HIS BRILLIANT PLATING THE WOODMAN PICKED UP HIS AXE AND MADE IT WHIRL SWIFTLY AROUND HIS HEAD
0335-125951-0002 BUT ALTHOUGH MANY WERE BEATEN OFF IN THIS WAY THE BIRDS WERE SO NUMEROUS AND SO BRAVE THAT THEY CONTINUED THE ATTACK AS FURIOUSLY AS BEFORE SOME OF THEM PECKED AT THE EYES OF THE GUMP WHICH HUNG OVER THE NEST IN A HELPLESS CONDITION
0335-125951-0003 BUT THE GUMP'S EYES WERE OF GLASS AND COULD NOT BE INJURED
0335-125951-0004 BUT THAT ANIMAL BEING STILL UPON HIS BACK KICKED OUT SO VICIOUSLY WITH HIS WOODEN LEGS
0335-125951-0005 COVERING TIP AND THE WOGGLE BUG AND JACK'S PUMPKIN HEAD AND BEGAN TEARING IT AWAY AND FLYING OFF WITH IT ONLY TO LET IT DROP STRAW BY STRAW INTO THE GREAT GULF BENEATH THE SCARECROW'S HEAD NOTING WITH DISMAY THIS WANTON DESTRUCTION OF HIS INTERIOR
0335-125951-0006 CRIED TO THE TIN WOODMAN TO SAVE HIM AND THAT GOOD FRIEND RESPONDED WITH RENEWED ENERGY HIS AXE FAIRLY FLASHED AMONG THE JACKDAWS AND FORTUNATELY THE GUMP BEGAN WILDLY WAVING THE TWO WINGS REMAINING ON THE LEFT SIDE OF ITS BODY
0335-125951-0007 THE FLUTTER OF THESE GREAT WINGS FILLED THE JACKDAWS WITH TERROR AND WHEN THE GUMP
0335-125951-0008 AND THEY FLED SCREAMING OVER THE MOUNTAINS WHEN THE LAST FOE HAD DISAPPEARED TIP CRAWLED FROM UNDER THE SOFAS AND ASSISTED THE WOGGLE BUG TO FOLLOW HIM
0335-125951-0009 WE OWE YOU MANY THANKS FOR THE GALLANT FIGHT YOU MADE I REALLY THINK WE HAVE ESCAPED VERY NICELY REMARKED THE TIN WOODMAN IN A TONE OF PRIDE NOT SO EXCLAIMED A HOLLOW VOICE
0335-125951-0010 AT THIS THEY ALL TURNED IN SURPRISE TO LOOK AT THE SCARECROW'S HEAD WHICH LAY AT THE BACK OF THE NEST I AM COMPLETELY RUINED DECLARED THE SCARECROW AS HE NOTED THEIR ASTONISHMENT
0335-125951-0011 SAID THE TIN WOODMAN TAKING UP THE SCARECROW'S HEAD AND CARESSING IT TENDERLY
0335-125951-0012 I DID IT TO SAVE MY FRIENDS RETURNED THE HEAD AND I AM GLAD THAT I PERISHED IN SO NOBLE AND UNSELFISH A MANNER BUT WHY ARE YOU ALL SO DESPONDENT INQUIRED THE WOGGLE BUG THE SCARECROW'S CLOTHING IS STILL SAFE
0335-125951-0013 YES ANSWERED THE TIN WOODMAN BUT OUR FRIEND'S CLOTHES ARE USELESS WITHOUT STUFFING WHY NOT STUFF HIM WITH MONEY
0335-125951-0014 AND TIP'S SUGGESTION WAS WITH THE SCARECROW'S CONSENT QUICKLY ACTED UPON THEY SELECTED ALL THE NEWEST AND CLEANEST BILLS AND ASSORTED THEM INTO VARIOUS PILES THE SCARECROW'S LEFT LEG AND BOOT WERE STUFFED WITH FIVE DOLLAR BILLS
0335-125951-0015 HOW ABOUT THESE WISHING PILLS ENQUIRED THE SCARECROW TAKING THE BOX FROM HIS JACKET POCKET CAN'T WE USE THEM TO ESCAPE NOT UNLESS WE CAN COUNT SEVENTEEN BY TWOS ANSWERED THE TIN WOODMAN
0335-125951-0016 BUT OUR FRIEND THE WOGGLE BUG CLAIMS TO BE HIGHLY EDUCATED SO HE OUGHT EASILY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT CAN BE DONE IT ISN'T A QUESTION OF EDUCATION
0335-125951-0017 ADDED THE SCARECROW YOUR MATHEMATICS SEEM TO ME VERY LIKE A BOTTLE OF MIXED PICKLES THE MORE YOU FISH FOR WHAT YOU WANT THE LESS CHANCE YOU HAVE OF GETTING IT I AM CERTAIN THAT IF THE THING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED AT ALL IT IS IN A VERY SIMPLE MANNER
0335-125951-0018 YES SAID TIP
0335-125951-0019 FOR SHE NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL WHY NOT START COUNTING AT A HALF OF ONE ASKED THE SAW HORSE ABRUPTLY THEN ANYONE CAN COUNT UP TO SEVENTEEN BY TWOS VERY EASILY THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN SURPRISE FOR THE SAW HORSE WAS CONSIDERED
0335-125951-0020 THE MOST STUPID OF THE ENTIRE PARTY YOU MAKE ME QUITE ASHAMED OF MYSELF SAID THE SCARECROW BOWING LOW TO THE SAW HORSE NEVERTHELESS THE CREATURE IS RIGHT DECLARED THE WOGGLE BUG
0335-125951-0021 SUGGESTED TIP I CAN'T SAID THE SCARECROW WHY NOT YOU'VE A MOUTH HAVEN'T YOU ASKED THE BOY YES BUT MY MOUTH IS PAINTED ON AND THERE'S NO SWALLOW CONNECTED WITH IT ANSWERED THE SCARECROW IN FACT HE CONTINUED
0335-125951-0022 LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER CRITICALLY I BELIEVE THE BOY AND THE WOGGLE BUG ARE THE ONLY ONES IN OUR PARTY THAT ARE ABLE TO SWALLOW OBSERVING THE TRUTH OF THIS REMARK TIP SAID THEN I WILL UNDERTAKE TO MAKE THE FIRST WISH
0335-125951-0023 THIS THE SCARECROW TRIED TO DO BUT HIS PADDED GLOVES WERE TOO CLUMSY TO CLUTCH SO SMALL AN OBJECT AND HE HELD THE BOX TOWARD THE BOY WHILE TIP SELECTED ONE OF THE PILLS AND SWALLOWED IT COUNT CRIED THE SCARECROW
0335-125951-0024 ENTREATED THE TIN WOODMAN TEARS OF SYMPATHY RUNNING DOWN HIS NICKEL CHEEKS I I DON'T KNOW
0335-125951-0025 THEN AT ONCE THE PAIN STOPPED AND THE BOY ROSE TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND FOUND THE SCARECROW LOOKING WITH AMAZEMENT AT THE END OF THE PEPPER BOX WHAT'S HAPPENED ASKED THE BOY A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HIS RECENT EXHIBITION
0335-125951-0026 WHY THE THREE PILLS ARE IN THE BOX AGAIN SAID THE SCARECROW OF COURSE THEY ARE THE WOGGLE BUG DECLARED
0335-125951-0027 THAT MAY BE BUT THE PILL GAVE ME A DREADFUL PAIN JUST THE SAME
0335-125951-0028 BUT I WON'T TAKE ANOTHER PILL I PROMISE YOU AND WITH THIS REMARK HE RETIRED SULKILY TO THE BACK OF THE NEST WELL SAID THE WOGGLE BUG IT REMAINS FOR ME TO SAVE US IN MY MOST HIGHLY MAGNIFIED AND THOROUGHLY EDUCATED MANNER FOR I SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE AND WILLING TO MAKE A WISH
0337-123025-0000 THE LADY ANNE OR A RUNAWAY HORSE EARLY IN THE SPRING LORD W AND PART OF HIS FAMILY WENT UP TO LONDON AND TOOK YORK WITH THEM
0337-123025-0001 AND THE HEAD GROOM WAS LEFT IN CHARGE THE LADY HARRIET WHO REMAINED AT THE HALL WAS A GREAT INVALID AND NEVER WENT OUT IN THE CARRIAGE AND THE LADY ANNE PREFERRED RIDING ON HORSEBACK WITH HER BROTHER OR COUSINS

0337-123025-0004 BUT GINGER WHO KNEW MORE OF HER THAN I DID TOLD ME SHE WAS RATHER NERVOUS
0337-123025-0005 STAYING AT THE HALL HE ALWAYS RODE LIZZIE AND PRAISED HER SO MUCH THAT ONE DAY LADY ANNE ORDERED THE SIDE SADDLE TO BE PUT ON HER AND THE OTHER SADDLE ON ME WHEN WE CAME TO THE DOOR THE GENTLEMAN SEEMED VERY UNEASY
0337-123025-0006 HOW IS THIS HE SAID ARE YOU TIRED OF YOUR GOOD BLACK AUSTER OH NO NOT AT ALL SHE REPLIED BUT I AM AMIABLE ENOUGH TO LET YOU RIDE HIM FOR ONCE

0337-123025-0012 WOULD THEY ASK THIS QUESTION FOR HER AT DOCTOR ASHLEY'S AND BRING THE ANSWER THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT A MILE OFF AND THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE WAS THE LAST IN IT WE WENT ALONG GAYLY ENOUGH

0337-123025-0014 AND WAS SOON HIDDEN AMONG THE TREES LIZZIE WAS STANDING QUIETLY BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A FEW PACES OFF WITH HER BACK TO ME MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS SITTING EASILY WITH A LOOSE REIN
0337-123025-0015 HUMMING A LITTLE SONG I LISTENED TO MY RIDER'S FOOTSTEPS UNTIL THEY REACHED THE HOUSE AND HEARD HIM KNOCK AT THE DOOR THERE WAS A MEADOW ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD THE GATE OF WHICH STOOD OPEN
0337-123025-0016 JUST THEN SOME CART HORSES AND SEVERAL YOUNG COLTS CAME TROTTING OUT IN A VERY DISORDERLY MANNER WHILE A BOY BEHIND WAS CRACKING A GREAT WHIP THE COLTS WERE WILD AND FROLICSOME
0337-123025-0017 AND WHETHER IT WAS THE STUPID COLT OR THE LOUD CRACKING OF THE WHIP
0337-123025-0018 BUT SHE GAVE A VIOLENT KICK AND DASHED OFF INTO A HEADLONG GALLOP IT WAS SO SUDDEN THAT LADY ANNE WAS NEARLY UNSEATED BUT SHE SOON RECOVERED HERSELF I GAVE A LOUD SHRILL NEIGH FOR HELP

0337-123025-0021 AND LEANING A LITTLE FORWARD WE DASHED AFTER THEM FOR ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF THE ROAD RAN STRAIGHT AND THEN BENT TO THE RIGHT AFTER WHICH IT DIVIDED INTO TWO ROADS
0337-123025-0022 LONG BEFORE WE CAME TO THE BEND SHE WAS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH WAY HAD SHE TURNED A WOMAN WAS STANDING AT HER GARDEN GATE SHADING HER EYES WITH HER HAND AND LOOKING EAGERLY UP THE ROAD
0337-123025-0023 SCARCELY DRAWING THE REIN BLANTYRE SHOUTED WHICH WAY TO THE RIGHT CRIED THE WOMAN POINTING WITH HER HAND AND AWAY WE WENT UP THE RIGHT HAND ROAD THEN FOR A MOMENT WE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER
0337-123025-0024 ANOTHER BEND AND SHE WAS HIDDEN AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES WE CAUGHT GLIMPSES AND THEN LOST THEM WE SCARCELY SEEMED TO GAIN GROUND UPON THEM AT ALL AN OLD ROAD MENDER WAS STANDING NEAR A HEAP OF STONES
0337-123025-0025 HIS SHOVEL DROPPED AND HIS HANDS RAISED AS WE CAME NEAR HE MADE A SIGN TO SPEAK
0337-123025-0026 TO THE COMMON TO THE COMMON SIR SHE HAS TURNED OFF THERE I KNEW THIS COMMON VERY WELL IT WAS FOR THE MOST PART VERY UNEVEN GROUND COVERED WITH HEATHER AND DARK GREEN FURZE BUSHES
0337-123025-0027 THERE WERE ALSO OPEN SPACES OF FINE SHORT GRASS WITH ANT HILLS AND MOLE TURNS EVERYWHERE
0337-123025-0028 WE HAD HARDLY TURNED ON THE COMMON WHEN WE CAUGHT SIGHT AGAIN OF THE GREEN HABIT FLYING ON BEFORE US MY LADY'S HAT WAS GONE AND HER LONG BROWN HAIR WAS STREAMING BEHIND HER HER HEAD AND BODY WERE THROWN BACK
0337-123025-0029 BUT NOW WITH A LIGHT HAND AND A PRACTICED EYE HE GUIDED ME OVER THE GROUND IN SUCH A MASTERLY MANNER THAT MY PACE WAS SCARCELY SLACKENED AND WE WERE DECIDEDLY GAINING ON THEM
0337-123025-0030 THERE HAD BEEN A WIDE DIKE RECENTLY CUT AND THE EARTH FROM THE CUTTING WAS CAST UP ROUGHLY ON THE OTHER SIDE SURELY THIS WOULD STOP THEM BUT NO WITH SCARCELY A PAUSE LIZZIE TOOK THE LEAP
0337-123025-0031 AND WITH ONE DETERMINED LEAP CLEARED BOTH DIKE AND BANK MOTIONLESS AMONG THE HEATHER WITH HER FACE TO THE EARTH
0337-123025-0032 THERE WAS NO SOUND GENTLY HE TURNED HER FACE UPWARD IT WAS GHASTLY WHITE AND THE EYES WERE CLOSED ANNIE DEAR ANNIE DO SPEAK BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER HE UNBUTTONED HER HABIT
0337-123025-0033 LOOSENED HER COLLAR FELT HER HANDS AND WRIST THEN STARTED UP AND LOOKED WILDLY ROUND HIM FOR HELP AT NO GREAT DISTANCE THERE WERE TWO MEN CUTTING TURF WHO SEEING LIZZIE RUNNING WILD WITHOUT A RIDER
0337-123025-0034 HAD LEFT THEIR WORK TO CATCH HER BLANTYRE'S HALLOO SOON BROUGHT THEM TO THE SPOT THE FOREMOST MAN SEEMED MUCH TROUBLED AT THE SIGHT AND ASKED WHAT HE COULD DO CAN YOU RIDE
0337-123025-0035 SHE WAS UNCOMMON GOOD TO MY WIFE IN THE WINTER THEN MOUNT THIS HORSE MY FRIEND YOUR NECK WILL BE QUITE SAFE AND RIDE TO THE DOCTOR'S AND ASK HIM TO COME INSTANTLY
0337-123025-0036 WITH LADY ANNE'S MAID AND HELP I SHALL STAY HERE ALL RIGHT SIR
0337-123025-0037 MAY OPEN HER EYES SOON THEN SEEING THE OTHER MAN HE CALLED OUT HERE JOE RUN FOR SOME WATER AND TELL MY MISSIS
0337-123025-0038 HE THEN SOMEHOW SCRAMBLED INTO THE SADDLE AND WITH A GEE UP AND A CLAP ON MY SIDES WITH BOTH HIS LEGS HE STARTED ON HIS JOURNEY MAKING A LITTLE CIRCUIT TO AVOID THE DIKE HE HAD NO WHIP WHICH SEEMED TO TROUBLE HIM
0337-123025-0039 BUT MY PACE SOON CURED THAT DIFFICULTY AND HE FOUND THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO STICK TO THE SADDLE AND HOLD ME IN WHICH HE DID MANFULLY I SHOOK HIM AS LITTLE AS I COULD HELP BUT ONCE OR TWICE
0337-123025-0040 STEADY WOAH STEADY ON THE HIGHROAD WE WERE ALL RIGHT AND AT THE DOCTOR'S AND THE HALL HE DID HIS ERRAND LIKE A GOOD MAN AND TRUE THEY ASKED HIM IN TO TAKE A DROP OF SOMETHING
0337-123025-0041 NO NO HE SAID I'LL BE BACK TO EM AGAIN BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE FIELDS
0337-123025-0042 THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE WERE TAKEN OFF AND A CLOTH THROWN OVER ME GINGER WAS SADDLED AND SENT OFF IN GREAT HASTE FOR LORD GEORGE AND I SOON HEARD THE CARRIAGE ROLL OUT OF THE YARD
0337-123025-0043 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE GINGER CAME BACK AND BEFORE WE WERE LEFT ALONE AND THEN SHE TOLD ME ALL THAT SHE HAD SEEN I CAN'T TELL MUCH SHE SAID WE WENT A GALLOP NEARLY ALL THE WAY
0337-123025-0044 AND GOT THERE JUST AS THE DOCTOR RODE UP THERE WAS A WOMAN SITTING ON THE GROUND WITH THE LADY'S HEAD IN HER LAP THE DOCTOR POURED SOMETHING INTO HER MOUTH BUT ALL THAT I HEARD WAS SHE IS NOT DEAD THEN I WAS LED OFF BY A MAN
0337-123025-0045 TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AFTER AWHILE SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE CARRIAGE AND WE CAME HOME TOGETHER I HEARD MY MASTER SAY TO A GENTLEMAN WHO STOPPED HIM TO INQUIRE THAT HE HOPED NO BONES WERE BROKEN BUT THAT SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN YET
0337-123025-0046 WHEN LORD GEORGE TOOK GINGER FOR HUNTING YORK SHOOK HIS HEAD HE SAID IT OUGHT TO BE A STEADY HAND TO TRAIN A HORSE FOR THE FIRST SEASON AND NOT A RANDOM RIDER LIKE LORD GEORGE GINGER USED TO LIKE IT VERY MUCH
0337-123025-0047 BUT SOMETIMES WHEN SHE CAME BACK I COULD SEE THAT SHE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH STRAINED AND NOW AND THEN SHE GAVE A SHORT COUGH SHE HAD TOO MUCH SPIRIT TO COMPLAIN BUT I COULD NOT HELP FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT HER
0337-123025-0048 TWO DAYS AFTER THE ACCIDENT BLANTYRE PAID ME A VISIT HE PATTED ME AND PRAISED ME VERY MUCH HE TOLD LORD GEORGE THAT HE WAS SURE THE HORSE KNEW OF ANNIE'S DANGER AS WELL AS HE DID
0337-123025-0049 I FOUND BY THEIR CONVERSATION THAT MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS NOW OUT OF DANGER AND WOULD SOON BE ABLE TO RIDE AGAIN
0337-123033-0000 NO DOUBT A HORSE FAIR IS A VERY AMUSING PLACE TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AT ANY RATE THERE IS PLENTY TO SEE
0337-123033-0001 LONG STRINGS OF YOUNG HORSES OUT OF THE COUNTRY FRESH FROM THE MARSHES AND DROVES OF SHAGGY LITTLE WELSH PONIES NO HIGHER THAN MERRYLEGS AND HUNDREDS OF CART HORSES OF ALL SORTS
0337-123033-0002 AND A GOOD MANY LIKE MYSELF HANDSOME AND HIGH BRED
0337-123033-0003 THROUGH SOME ACCIDENT OR BLEMISH UNSOUNDNESS OF WIND OR SOME OTHER COMPLAINT THERE WERE SOME SPLENDID ANIMALS QUITE IN THEIR PRIME AND FIT FOR ANYTHING THEY WERE THROWING OUT THEIR LEGS AND SHOWING OFF THEIR PACES IN HIGH STYLE
0337-123033-0004 AS THEY WERE TROTTED OUT WITH A LEADING REIN THE GROOM RUNNING BY THE SIDE BUT ROUND IN THE BACKGROUND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF POOR THINGS SADLY BROKEN DOWN WITH HARD WORK WITH THEIR KNEES KNUCKLING OVER
0337-123033-0005 AND THERE WERE SOME VERY DEJECTED LOOKING OLD HORSES WITH THE UNDER LIP HANGING DOWN AND THE EARS LYING BACK HEAVILY AS IF THERE WERE NO MORE PLEASURE IN LIFE AND NO MORE HOPE THERE WERE SOME SO THIN YOU MIGHT SEE ALL THEIR RIBS
0337-123033-0006 AND SOME WITH OLD SORES ON THEIR BACKS AND HIPS THESE WERE SAD SIGHTS FOR A HORSE TO LOOK UPON WHO KNOWS NOT BUT HE MAY COME TO THE SAME STATE THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF BARGAINING OF RUNNING UP AND BEATING DOWN
0337-123033-0007 AND IF A HORSE MAY SPEAK HIS MIND SO FAR AS HE UNDERSTANDS I SHOULD SAY THERE WERE MORE LIES TOLD AND MORE TRICKERY AT THAT HORSE FAIR
0337-123033-0008 I WAS PUT WITH TWO OR THREE OTHER STRONG USEFUL LOOKING HORSES AND A GOOD MANY PEOPLE CAME TO LOOK AT US THE GENTLEMEN ALWAYS TURNED FROM ME WHEN THEY SAW MY BROKEN KNEES
0337-123033-0009 THOUGH THE MAN WHO HAD ME SWORE IT WAS ONLY A SLIP IN THE STALL THE FIRST THING WAS TO PULL MY MOUTH OPEN
0337-123033-0010 THEN FEEL ALL THE WAY DOWN MY LEGS AND GIVE ME A HARD FEEL OF THE SKIN AND FLESH AND THEN TRY MY PACES IT WAS WONDERFUL WHAT A DIFFERENCE THERE WAS IN THE WAY THESE THINGS WERE DONE SOME DID IT IN A ROUGH OFFHAND WAY AS IF
0337-123033-0011 WHILE OTHERS WOULD TAKE THEIR HANDS GENTLY OVER ONE'S BODY WITH A PAT NOW AND THEN AS MUCH AS TO SAY BY YOUR LEAVE OF COURSE I JUDGED A GOOD DEAL OF THE BUYERS BY THEIR MANNERS TO MYSELF
0337-123033-0012 THERE WAS ONE MAN I THOUGHT IF HE WOULD BUY ME I SHOULD BE HAPPY HE WAS NOT A GENTLEMAN NOR YET ONE OF THE LOUD FLASHY SORT THAT CALL THEMSELVES SO HE WAS RATHER A SMALL MAN BUT WELL MADE
0337-123033-0013 AND QUICK IN ALL HIS MOTIONS I KNEW IN A MOMENT BY THE WAY HE HANDLED ME THAT HE WAS USED TO HORSES HE SPOKE GENTLY AND HIS GRAY EYE HAD A KINDLY CHEERY LOOK IN IT IT MAY SEEM STRANGE TO SAY
0337-123033-0014 NO SMELL OF OLD BEER AND TOBACCO WHICH I HATED BUT A FRESH SMELL AS IF HE HAD COME OUT OF A HAYLOFT HE OFFERED TWENTY THREE POUNDS FOR ME BUT THAT WAS REFUSED AND HE WALKED AWAY
0337-123033-0015 BUT HE WALKED OFF ONE OR TWO MORE CAME WHO DID NOT MEAN BUSINESS THEN THE HARD FACED MAN CAME BACK AGAIN AND OFFERED TWENTY THREE POUNDS A VERY CLOSE BARGAIN WAS BEING DRIVEN FOR MY SALESMAN
0337-123033-0016 BEGAN TO THINK HE SHOULD NOT GET ALL HE ASKED AND MUST COME DOWN BUT JUST THEN THE GRAY EYED MAN CAME BACK AGAIN I COULD NOT HELP REACHING OUT MY HEAD TOWARD HIM HE STROKED MY FACE KINDLY
0337-123033-0017 WELL OLD CHAP HE SAID I THINK WE SHOULD SUIT EACH OTHER I'LL GIVE TWENTY FOUR FOR HIM SAY TWENTY FIVE AND YOU SHALL HAVE HIM TWENTY FOUR TEN SAID MY FRIEND IN A VERY DECIDED TONE
0337-123033-0018 AND NOT ANOTHER SIXPENCE YES OR NO DONE SAID THE SALESMAN AND YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT THERE'S A MONSTROUS DEAL OF QUALITY IN THAT HORSE AND IF YOU WANT HIM FOR CAB WORK HE'S A BARGAIN
0337-123033-0019 THE MONEY WAS PAID ON THE SPOT AND MY NEW MASTER TOOK MY HALTER AND LED ME OUT OF THE FAIR TO AN INN WHERE HE HAD A SADDLE AND BRIDLE READY HE GAVE ME A GOOD FEED OF OATS AND STOOD BY WHILE I ATE IT
0337-123033-0020 TALKING TO HIMSELF AND TALKING TO ME HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO LONDON THROUGH PLEASANT LANES AND COUNTRY ROADS UNTIL WE CAME INTO THE GREAT LONDON THOROUGHFARE ON WHICH WE TRAVELED STEADILY
0337-123033-0021 TILL IN THE TWILIGHT WE REACHED THE GREAT CITY THE GAS LAMPS WERE ALREADY LIGHTED THERE WERE STREETS TO THE RIGHT AND STREETS TO THE LEFT AND STREETS CROSSING EACH OTHER FOR MILE UPON MILE I THOUGHT WE SHOULD NEVER COME TO THE END OF THEM
0337-123033-0022 AT LAST IN PASSING THROUGH ONE WE CAME TO A LONG CAB STAND WHEN MY RIDER CALLED OUT IN A CHEERY VOICE GOOD NIGHT GOVERNOR HALLOO CRIED A VOICE HAVE YOU GOT A GOOD ONE I THINK SO REPLIED MY OWNER
0337-123033-0023 I WISH YOU LUCK WITH HIM THANK YOU GOVERNOR AND HE RODE ON WE SOON TURNED UP ONE OF THE SIDE STREETS AND ABOUT HALFWAY UP THAT WE TURNED INTO A VERY NARROW STREET WITH RATHER POOR LOOKING HOUSES ON ONE SIDE
0337-123033-0024 AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE COACH HOUSES AND STABLES ON THE OTHER MY OWNER PULLED UP AT ONE OF THE HOUSES AND WHISTLED THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A YOUNG WOMAN FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE GIRL AND BOY RAN OUT
0337-123033-0025 OPEN THE GATES AND MOTHER WILL BRING US THE LANTERN THE NEXT MINUTE THEY WERE ALL STANDING ROUND ME IN A SMALL STABLE YARD IS HE GENTLE FATHER YES DOLLY AS GENTLE AS YOUR OWN KITTEN COME AND PAT HIM
0337-123033-0026 AT ONCE THE LITTLE HAND WAS PATTING ABOUT ALL OVER MY SHOULDER WITHOUT FEAR HOW GOOD IT FELT LET ME GET HIM A BRAN MASH WHILE YOU RUB HIM DOWN SAID THE MOTHER DO POLLY IT'S JUST WHAT HE WANTS
0337-123033-0027 AND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL MASH READY FOR ME SAUSAGE DUMPLING AND APPLE TURNOVER SHOUTED THE BOY WHICH SET THEM ALL LAUGHING I WAS LED INTO A COMFORTABLE CLEAN SMELLING STALL WITH PLENTY OF DRY STRAW
0337-126286-0000 THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES THERE WAS A KING WHO HAD TWELVE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS THEY SLEPT IN TWELVE BEDS ALL IN ONE ROOM AND WHEN THEY WENT TO BED THE DOORS WERE SHUT
0337-126286-0001 AND LOCKED UP BUT EVERY MORNING THEIR SHOES WERE FOUND TO BE QUITE WORN THROUGH AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DANCED IN ALL NIGHT AND YET NOBODY COULD FIND OUT HOW IT HAPPENED OR WHERE THEY HAD BEEN THEN THE KING MADE IT KNOWN TO ALL THE LAND
0337-126286-0002 THAT IF ANY PERSON COULD DISCOVER THE SECRET AND FIND OUT WHERE IT WAS THAT THE PRINCESSES DANCED IN THE NIGHT HE SHOULD HAVE THE ONE HE LIKED BEST FOR HIS WIFE AND SHOULD BE KING AFTER HIS DEATH
0337-126286-0003 BUT WHOEVER TRIED AND DID NOT SUCCEED AFTER THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH A KING'S SON SOON CAME HE WAS WELL ENTERTAINED AND IN THE EVENING
0337-126286-0004 WAS TAKEN TO THE CHAMBER NEXT TO THE ONE WHERE THE PRINCESSES LAY IN THEIR TWELVE BEDS THERE HE WAS TO SIT AND WATCH WHERE THEY WENT TO DANCE AND IN ORDER THAT NOTHING MIGHT PASS WITHOUT HIS HEARING IT THE DOOR OF HIS CHAMBER WAS LEFT OPEN
0337-126286-0005 BUT THE KING'S SON SOON FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN HE AWOKE IN THE MORNING HE FOUND THAT THE PRINCESSES HAD ALL BEEN DANCING FOR THE SOLES OF THEIR SHOES WERE FULL OF HOLES THE SAME THING HAPPENED THE SECOND AND THIRD NIGHT SO THE KING
0337-126286-0006 ORDERED HIS HEAD TO BE CUT OFF AFTER HIM CAME SEVERAL OTHERS
0337-126286-0007 NOW IT CHANCED THAT AN OLD SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN WOUNDED IN BATTLE AND COULD FIGHT NO LONGER PASSED THROUGH THE COUNTRY WHERE THIS KING REIGNED AND AS HE WAS TRAVELLING THROUGH A WOOD HE MET AN OLD WOMAN WHO ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS GOING
0337-126286-0008 I HARDLY KNOW WHERE I AM GOING OR WHAT I HAD BETTER DO SAID THE SOLDIER BUT I THINK I SHOULD LIKE VERY WELL TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS THAT THE PRINCESSES DANCE AND THEN IN TIME I MIGHT BE A KING WELL SAID THE OLD DAME
0337-126286-0009 ONLY TAKE CARE NOT TO DRINK ANY OF THE WINE WHICH ONE OF THE PRINCESSES WILL BRING TO YOU IN THE EVENING AND AS SOON AS SHE LEAVES YOU PRETEND TO BE FAST ASLEEP THEN SHE GAVE HIM A CLOAK AND SAID
0337-126286-0010 AS SOON AS YOU PUT THAT ON YOU WILL BECOME INVISIBLE AND YOU WILL THEN BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE PRINCESSES WHEREVER THEY GO
0337-126286-0011 HE DETERMINED TO TRY HIS LUCK SO HE WENT TO THE KING AND SAID HE WAS WILLING TO UNDERTAKE THE TASK HE WAS AS WELL RECEIVED AS THE OTHERS HAD BEEN AND THE KING ORDERED FINE ROYAL ROBES TO BE GIVEN HIM
0337-126286-0012 AND WHEN THE EVENING CAME HE WAS LED TO THE OUTER CHAMBER JUST AS HE WAS GOING TO LIE DOWN THE ELDEST OF THE PRINCESSES BROUGHT HIM A CUP OF WINE BUT THE SOLDIER THREW IT ALL AWAY SECRETLY TAKING CARE NOT TO DRINK A DROP
0337-126286-0013 THEN HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN ON HIS BED AND IN A LITTLE WHILE
0337-126286-0014 AS IF HE WAS FAST ASLEEP WHEN THE TWELVE PRINCESSES HEARD THIS THEY LAUGHED HEARTILY AND THE ELDEST SAID THIS FELLOW TOO MIGHT HAVE DONE A WISER THING THAN LOSE HIS LIFE IN THIS WAY
0337-126286-0015 THEN THEY ROSE UP AND OPENED THEIR DRAWERS AND BOXES AND TOOK OUT ALL THEIR FINE CLOTHES AND DRESSED THEMSELVES AT THE GLASS
0337-126286-0016 BUT THE YOUNGEST SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS WHILE YOU ARE SO HAPPY I FEEL VERY UNEASY I AM SURE SOME MISCHANCE WILL BEFALL US YOU SIMPLETON SAID THE ELDEST YOU ARE ALWAYS AFRAID
0337-126286-0017 HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN HOW MANY KINGS SONS HAVE ALREADY WATCHED IN VAIN AND AS FOR THIS SOLDIER EVEN IF I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM HIS SLEEPING DRAUGHT
0337-126286-0018 THE ELDEST LEADING THE WAY AND THINKING HE HAD NO TIME TO LOSE HE JUMPED UP PUT ON THE CLOAK WHICH THE OLD WOMAN HAD GIVEN HIM AND FOLLOWED THEM BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAIRS HE TROD ON THE GOWN OF THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
0337-126286-0019 AND SHE CRIED OUT TO HER SISTERS ALL IS NOT RIGHT
0337-126286-0020 YOU SILLY CREATURE SAID THE ELDEST IT IS NOTHING BUT A NAIL IN THE WALL THEN DOWN THEY ALL WENT AND AT THE BOTTOM THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A MOST DELIGHTFUL GROVE OF TREES AND THE LEAVES WERE ALL OF SILVER
0337-126286-0021 AND GLITTERED AND SPARKLED BEAUTIFULLY THE SOLDIER WISHED TO TAKE AWAY SOME TOKEN OF THE PLACE SO HE BROKE OFF A LITTLE BRANCH AND THERE CAME A LOUD NOISE FROM THE TREE THEN THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER SAID AGAIN
0337-126286-0022 BUT THE ELDEST SAID IT IS ONLY OUR PRINCES WHO ARE SHOUTING FOR JOY AT OUR APPROACH THEN THEY CAME TO ANOTHER GROVE OF TREES WHERE ALL THE LEAVES WERE OF GOLD AND AFTERWARDS TO A THIRD WHERE THE LEAVES WERE ALL GLITTERING DIAMONDS
0337-126286-0023 AND THE SOLDIER BROKE A BRANCH FROM EACH AND EVERY TIME THERE WAS A LOUD NOISE WHICH MADE THE YOUNGEST SISTER TREMBLE WITH FEAR BUT THE ELDEST STILL SAID IT WAS ONLY THE PRINCES WHO WERE CRYING FOR JOY
0337-126286-0024 SO THEY WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO A GREAT LAKE AND AT THE SIDE OF THE LAKE THERE LAY TWELVE LITTLE BOATS WITH TWELVE HANDSOME PRINCES IN THEM WHO SEEMED TO BE WAITING THERE FOR THE PRINCESSES ONE OF THE PRINCESSES WENT INTO EACH BOAT
0337-126286-0025 AND THE SOLDIER STEPPED INTO THE SAME BOAT WITH THE YOUNGEST AS THEY WERE ROWING OVER THE LAKE THE PRINCE WHO WAS IN THE BOAT WITH THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS AND THE SOLDIER SAID I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT IS BUT THOUGH I AM ROWING WITH ALL MY MIGHT
0337-126286-0026 WE DO NOT GET ON SO FAST AS USUAL AND I AM QUITE TIRED THE BOAT SEEMS VERY HEAVY TODAY IT IS ONLY THE HEAT OF THE WEATHER SAID THE PRINCESS I FEEL IT VERY WARM TOO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE STOOD A FINE ILLUMINATED CASTLE
0337-126286-0027 THERE THEY ALL LANDED AND WENT INTO THE CASTLE AND EACH PRINCE DANCED WITH HIS PRINCESS AND THE SOLDIER WHO WAS ALL THE TIME INVISIBLE DANCED WITH THEM TOO AND WHEN ANY OF THE PRINCESSES HAD A CUP OF WINE SET BY HER HE DRANK IT ALL UP
0337-126286-0028 SO THAT WHEN SHE PUT THE CUP TO HER MOUTH IT WAS EMPTY AT THIS TOO THE YOUNGEST SISTER WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED BUT THE ELDEST ALWAYS SILENCED HER
0337-126286-0030 WHEN THEY CAME TO THE STAIRS THE SOLDIER RAN ON BEFORE THE PRINCESSES AND LAID HIMSELF DOWN AND AS THE TWELVE SISTERS SLOWLY CAME UP VERY MUCH TIRED THEY HEARD HIM SNORING IN HIS BED SO THEY SAID
0337-126286-0031 NOW ALL IS QUITE SAFE THEN THEY UNDRESSED THEMSELVES PUT AWAY THEIR FINE CLOTHES PULLED OFF THEIR SHOES AND WENT TO BED IN THE MORNING THE SOLDIER SAID NOTHING ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
0337-126286-0032 AND EVERY THING HAPPENED JUST AS BEFORE THE PRINCESSES DANCED EACH TIME TILL THEIR SHOES WERE WORN TO PIECES AND THEN RETURNED HOME HOWEVER ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE SOLDIER CARRIED AWAY ONE OF THE GOLDEN CUPS AS A TOKEN OF WHERE HE HAD BEEN
0337-126286-0033 AS SOON AS THE TIME CAME WHEN HE WAS TO DECLARE THE SECRET HE WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE KING WITH THE THREE BRANCHES AND THE GOLDEN CUP AND THE TWELVE PRINCESSES STOOD LISTENING BEHIND THE DOOR TO HEAR WHAT HE WOULD SAY
0337-126286-0034 AND WHEN THE KING ASKED HIM WHERE DO MY TWELVE DAUGHTERS DANCE AT NIGHT HE ANSWERED WITH TWELVE PRINCES IN A CASTLE UNDER GROUND AND THEN HE TOLD THE KING ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND SHOWED HIM THE THREE BRANCHES AND THE GOLDEN CUP
0337-126286-0035 WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM THEN THE KING CALLED FOR THE PRINCESSES AND ASKED THEM WHETHER WHAT THE SOLDIER SAID WAS TRUE AND WHEN THEY SAW THAT THEY WERE DISCOVERED
0337-126286-0036 THEY CONFESSED IT ALL AND THE KING ASKED THE SOLDIER
0337-126286-0037 I AM NOT VERY YOUNG SO I WILL HAVE THE ELDEST AND THEY WERE MARRIED THAT VERY DAY
0339-132717-0000 HERLAND BY CHARLOTTE PERKINS STETSON GILMAN
0339-132717-0001 CHAPTER ONE A NOT UNNATURAL ENTERPRISE THIS IS WRITTEN FROM MEMORY UNFORTUNATELY IF I COULD HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME THE MATERIAL I SO CAREFULLY PREPARED THIS WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT STORY
0339-132717-0002 WHOLE BOOKS FULL OF NOTES CAREFULLY COPIED RECORDS FIRSTHAND DESCRIPTIONS AND THE PICTURES THAT'S THE WORST LOSS WE HAD SOME BIRD'S EYES OF THE CITIES AND PARKS
0339-132717-0003 AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL OF THE WOMEN THEMSELVES NOBODY WILL EVER BELIEVE HOW THEY LOOKED DESCRIPTIONS AREN'T ANY GOOD WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN AND I NEVER WAS GOOD AT DESCRIPTIONS ANYHOW BUT IT'S GOT TO BE DONE SOMEHOW
0339-132717-0004 THE REST OF THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT THAT COUNTRY I HAVEN'T SAID WHERE IT WAS FOR FEAR SOME SELF APPOINTED MISSIONARIES OR TRADERS OR LAND GREEDY EXPANSIONISTS WILL TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO PUSH IN THEY WILL NOT BE WANTED I CAN TELL THEM THAT
0339-132717-0005 AND WILL FARE WORSE THAN WE DID IF THEY DO FIND IT IT BEGAN THIS WAY THERE WERE THREE OF US CLASSMATES AND FRIENDS TERRY O NICHOLSON
0339-132717-0006 JEFF MARGRAVE AND I VANDYCK JENNINGS WE HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER YEARS AND YEARS AND IN SPITE OF OUR DIFFERENCES WE HAD A GOOD DEAL IN COMMON ALL OF US WERE INTERESTED IN SCIENCE TERRY WAS RICH ENOUGH TO DO AS HE PLEASED
0339-132717-0007 HIS GREAT AIM WAS EXPLORATION HE USED TO MAKE ALL KINDS OF A ROW BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO EXPLORE NOW ONLY PATCHWORK AND FILLING IN HE SAID HE FILLED IN WELL ENOUGH HE HAD A LOT OF TALENTS GREAT ON MECHANICS AND ELECTRICITY
0339-132717-0008 JEFF MARGRAVE WAS BORN TO BE A POET A BOTANIST OR BOTH BUT HIS FOLKS PERSUADED HIM TO BE A DOCTOR INSTEAD HE WAS A GOOD ONE FOR HIS AGE BUT HIS REAL INTEREST WAS IN WHAT HE LOVED TO CALL THE WONDERS OF SCIENCE
0339-132717-0009 AS FOR ME SOCIOLOGY'S MY MAJOR YOU HAVE TO BACK THAT UP WITH A LOT OF OTHER SCIENCES OF COURSE
0339-132717-0010 THEY NEEDED A DOCTOR AND THAT GAVE JEFF AN EXCUSE FOR DROPPING HIS JUST OPENING PRACTICE THEY NEEDED TERRY'S EXPERIENCE HIS MACHINE AND HIS MONEY AND AS FOR ME I GOT IN THROUGH TERRY'S INFLUENCE
0339-132717-0011 THE EXPEDITION WAS UP AMONG THE THOUSAND TRIBUTARIES AND ENORMOUS HINTERLAND OF A GREAT RIVER
0339-132717-0012 SAVAGE DIALECTS STUDIED AND ALL MANNER OF STRANGE FLORA AND FAUNA EXPECTED BUT THIS STORY IS NOT ABOUT THAT EXPEDITION THAT WAS ONLY THE MEREST STARTER FOR OURS
0339-132717-0013 MY INTEREST WAS FIRST ROUSED BY TALK AMONG OUR GUIDES I'M QUICK AT LANGUAGES KNOW A GOOD MANY AND PICK THEM UP READILY WHAT WITH THAT AND A REALLY GOOD INTERPRETER WE TOOK WITH US I MADE OUT QUITE A FEW LEGENDS AND FOLK MYTHS OF THESE SCATTERED TRIBES
0339-132717-0014 AND AS WE GOT FARTHER AND FARTHER UPSTREAM IN A DARK TANGLE OF RIVERS LAKES MORASSES AND DENSE FORESTS WITH HERE AND THERE AN UNEXPECTED LONG SPUR RUNNING OUT FROM THE BIG MOUNTAINS BEYOND I NOTICED THAT MORE AND MORE OF THESE SAVAGES HAD A STORY
0339-132717-0015 ABOUT A STRANGE AND TERRIBLE WOMAN LAND IN THE HIGH DISTANCE UP YONDER OVER THERE WAY UP WAS ALL THE DIRECTION THEY COULD OFFER BUT THEIR LEGENDS ALL AGREED ON THE MAIN POINT
0339-132717-0016 THAT THERE WAS THIS STRANGE COUNTRY WHERE NO MEN LIVED ONLY WOMEN AND GIRL CHILDREN NONE OF THEM HAD EVER SEEN IT IT WAS DANGEROUS DEADLY THEY SAID FOR ANY MAN TO GO THERE
0339-132717-0017 BUT THERE WERE TALES OF LONG AGO WHEN SOME BRAVE INVESTIGATOR HAD SEEN IT A BIG COUNTRY BIG HOUSES PLENTY PEOPLE ALL WOMEN HAD NO ONE ELSE GONE
0339-132717-0018 BUT THEY NEVER CAME BACK IT WAS NO PLACE FOR MEN OF THAT THEY SEEMED SURE I TOLD THE BOYS ABOUT THESE STORIES AND THEY LAUGHED AT THEM NATURALLY I DID MYSELF I KNEW THE STUFF THAT SAVAGE DREAMS ARE MADE OF
0339-132717-0019 BUT WHEN WE HAD REACHED OUR FARTHEST POINT JUST THE DAY BEFORE WE ALL HAD TO TURN AROUND AND START FOR HOME AGAIN AS THE BEST OF EXPEDITIONS MUST IN TIME WE THREE MADE A DISCOVERY THE MAIN ENCAMPMENT WAS ON A SPIT OF LAND RUNNING OUT INTO THE MAIN STREAM
0339-132717-0020 OR WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS THE MAIN STREAM
0339-132717-0021 THE SAME TASTE I HAPPENED TO SPEAK OF THAT RIVER TO OUR LAST GUIDE A RATHER SUPERIOR FELLOW WITH QUICK BRIGHT EYES HE TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER RIVER OVER THERE SHORT RIVER SWEET WATER RED AND BLUE
0339-132717-0022 SO I SHOWED HIM A RED AND BLUE PENCIL I CARRIED AND ASKED AGAIN YES HE POINTED TO THE RIVER AND THEN TO THE SOUTHWESTWARD RIVER GOOD WATER RED AND BLUE
0339-132717-0023 I TOLD HIM TERRY BLAZED UP AT ONCE ASK HIM HOW FAR IT IS THE MAN INDICATED A SHORT JOURNEY I JUDGED ABOUT TWO HOURS MAYBE THREE
0339-132717-0024 LET'S GO URGED TERRY JUST US THREE MAYBE WE CAN REALLY FIND SOMETHING MAY BE CINNABAR IN IT MAY BE INDIGO JEFF SUGGESTED WITH HIS LAZY SMILE IT WAS EARLY YET WE HAD JUST BREAKFASTED
0339-132717-0025 AND LEAVING WORD THAT WE'D BE BACK BEFORE NIGHT WE GOT AWAY QUIETLY NOT WISHING TO BE THOUGHT TOO GULLIBLE IF WE FAILED AND SECRETLY HOPING TO HAVE SOME NICE LITTLE DISCOVERY ALL TO OURSELVES IT WAS A LONG TWO HOURS NEARER THREE
0339-132717-0026 THERE WAS A DESPERATE TANGLE OF WOOD AND WATER AND A SWAMPY PATCH WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE FOUND OUR WAY ACROSS ALONE BUT THERE WAS ONE AND I COULD SEE TERRY WITH COMPASS AND NOTEBOOK MARKING DIRECTIONS AND TRYING TO PLACE LANDMARKS
0339-132717-0027 WE CAME AFTER A WHILE TO A SORT OF MARSHY LAKE VERY BIG SO THAT THE CIRCLING FOREST LOOKED QUITE LOW AND DIM ACROSS IT OUR GUIDE TOLD US THAT BOATS COULD GO FROM THERE TO OUR CAMP BUT LONG WAY ALL DAY
0339-132717-0028 THE GROUND GROWING FIRMER AS WE ADVANCED AND PRESENTLY WE TURNED THE CORNER OF A WOODED PROMONTORY AND SAW A QUITE DIFFERENT COUNTRY A SUDDEN VIEW OF MOUNTAINS STEEP AND BARE ONE OF THOSE LONG EASTERLY SPURS TERRY SAID APPRAISINGLY
0339-132717-0029 MAY BE HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM THE RANGE THEY CROP OUT LIKE THAT SUDDENLY WE LEFT THE LAKE AND STRUCK DIRECTLY TOWARD THE CLIFFS WE HEARD RUNNING WATER BEFORE WE REACHED IT AND THE GUIDE POINTED PROUDLY TO HIS RIVER IT WAS SHORT
0339-132717-0030 WE COULD SEE WHERE IT POURED DOWN A NARROW VERTICAL CATARACT FROM AN OPENING IN THE FACE OF THE CLIFF IT WAS SWEET WATER THE GUIDE DRANK EAGERLY AND SO DID WE THAT'S SNOW WATER TERRY ANNOUNCED MUST COME FROM WAY BACK IN THE HILLS
0339-132717-0031 BUT AS TO BEING RED AND BLUE IT WAS GREENISH IN TINT THE GUIDE SEEMED NOT AT ALL SURPRISED HE HUNTED ABOUT A LITTLE AND SHOWED US A QUIET MARGINAL POOL WHERE THERE WERE SMEARS OF RED ALONG THE BORDER YES AND OF BLUE
0339-132717-0032 TERRY GOT OUT HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS AND SQUATTED DOWN TO INVESTIGATE CHEMICALS OF SOME SORT I CAN'T TELL ON THE SPOT LOOK TO ME LIKE DYESTUFFS LET'S GET NEARER HE URGED UP THERE BY THE FALL
0339-132717-0033 WE SCRAMBLED ALONG THE STEEP BANKS AND GOT CLOSE TO THE POOL THAT FOAMED AND BOILED BENEATH THE FALLING WATER HERE WE SEARCHED THE BORDER AND FOUND TRACES OF COLOR BEYOND DISPUTE MORE JEFF SUDDENLY HELD UP AN UNLOOKED FOR TROPHY
0339-132717-0034 IT WAS ONLY A RAG A LONG RAVELED FRAGMENT OF CLOTH BUT IT WAS A WELL WOVEN FABRIC WITH A PATTERN AND OF A CLEAR SCARLET THAT THE WATER HAD NOT FADED
0339-132717-0035 WOMAN COUNTRY UP THERE THEN WE WERE INTERESTED
0339-132717-0036 AND PUMPED THE MAN FOR FURTHER INFORMATION HE COULD TELL US ONLY WHAT THE OTHERS HAD A LAND OF WOMEN NO MEN BABIES BUT ALL GIRLS NO PLACE FOR MEN DANGEROUS SOME HAD GONE TO SEE NONE HAD COME BACK
0339-132717-0037 I COULD SEE TERRY'S JAW SET AT THAT NO PLACE FOR MEN DANGEROUS HE LOOKED AS IF HE MIGHT SHIN UP THE WATERFALL ON THE SPOT BUT THE GUIDE WOULD NOT HEAR OF GOING UP EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY POSSIBLE METHOD OF SCALING THAT SHEER CLIFF
0339-132717-0038 AND WE HAD TO GET BACK TO OUR PARTY BEFORE NIGHT
0339-132717-0039 BUT TERRY STOPPED IN HIS TRACKS LOOK HERE FELLOWS HE SAID THIS IS OUR FIND LET'S NOT TELL THOSE COCKY OLD PROFESSORS LET'S GO ON HOME WITH EM AND THEN COME BACK JUST US HAVE A LITTLE EXPEDITION OF OUR OWN WE LOOKED AT HIM MUCH IMPRESSED
0339-132717-0040 OF COURSE WE DIDN'T BELIEVE THE STORY
0339-132717-0041 THERE IS NO SUCH CLOTH MADE BY ANY OF THESE LOCAL TRIBES I ANNOUNCED EXAMINING THOSE RAGS WITH GREAT CARE SOMEWHERE UP YONDER THEY SPIN AND WEAVE AND DYE AS WELL AS WE DO THAT WOULD MEAN A CONSIDERABLE CIVILIZATION VAN
0339-132717-0042 PRECIOUS FEW PEOPLE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT AND IT'S BEEN MINDING ITS OWN BUSINESS FOR A THOUSAND YEARS THEN THERE'S MONTENEGRO SPLENDID LITTLE STATE YOU COULD LOSE A DOZEN MONTENEGROES UP AND DOWN THESE GREAT RANGES WE DISCUSSED IT HOTLY ALL THE WAY BACK TO CAMP
0339-132717-0043 BUT T O NICHOLSON COULD FIX UP HIS BIG STEAM YACHT LOAD HIS SPECIALLY MADE BIG MOTORBOAT ABOARD AND TUCK IN A DISSEMBLED BIPLANE WITHOUT ANY MORE NOTICE THAN A SNIP IN THE SOCIETY COLUMN WE HAD PROVISIONS AND PREVENTIVES AND ALL MANNER OF SUPPLIES
0339-132717-0044 HIS PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE STOOD HIM IN GOOD STEAD THERE IT WAS A VERY COMPLETE LITTLE OUTFIT
0339-132717-0046 YOU DON'T NEED TO GO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TERRY REMARKED DRILY GO YOU'LL HAVE TO GET AN INJUNCTION TO STOP ME BOTH JEFF AND I WERE SURE ABOUT THAT BUT
0339-132717-0047 NOW WE HAD NO EAVESDROPPERS WE COULD LOLL AND LOAF IN OUR DECK CHAIRS AND TALK AND TALK THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO
0339-132717-0048 WE'LL LEAVE PAPERS WITH OUR CONSUL WHERE THE YACHT STAYS TERRY PLANNED
0339-132717-0049 A PUNITIVE EXPEDITION I URGED IF THE LADIES DO EAT US WE MUST MAKE REPRISALS
0339-132717-0050 YES BUT HOW WILL THEY GET UP ASKED JEFF SAME WAY WE DO OF COURSE IF THREE VALUABLE AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE LOST UP THERE THEY WILL FOLLOW SOMEHOW TO SAY NOTHING OF THE GLITTERING ATTRACTIONS OF THAT FAIR LAND LET'S CALL IT FEMINISIA
0339-132717-0051 HE BROKE OFF YOU'RE RIGHT TERRY ONCE THE STORY GETS OUT THE RIVER WILL CRAWL WITH EXPEDITIONS AND THE AIRSHIPS RISE LIKE A SWARM OF MOSQUITOES I LAUGHED AS I THOUGHT OF IT WE'VE MADE A GREAT MISTAKE NOT TO LET MISTER YELLOW PRESS IN ON THIS SAVE US
0339-132717-0052 WHAT HEADLINES NOT MUCH SAID TERRY GRIMLY THIS IS OUR PARTY WE'RE GOING TO FIND THAT PLACE ALONE
0339-132717-0053 IF YOU DO JEFF ASKED MILDLY JEFF WAS A TENDER SOUL I THINK HE THOUGHT THAT COUNTRY IF THERE WAS ONE WAS JUST
0339-132717-0054 WELL TERRY WAS POPULAR AMONG WOMEN EVEN WHEN THERE WERE OTHER MEN AROUND AND IT'S NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT HE HAD PLEASANT DREAMS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN I COULD SEE IT IN HIS EYES AS HE LAY THERE
0339-132717-0055 LOOKING AT THE LONG BLUE ROLLERS SLIPPING BY AND FINGERING THAT IMPRESSIVE MUSTACHE OF HIS BUT I THOUGHT THEN THAT I COULD FORM A FAR CLEARER IDEA OF WHAT WAS BEFORE US THAN EITHER OF THEM YOU'RE ALL OFF BOYS I INSISTED
0339-132717-0056 YOU'LL FIND IT'S BUILT ON A SORT OF MATRIARCHAL PRINCIPLE THAT'S ALL
0339-132717-0057 A SORT OF WEDDING CALL THIS IS A CONDITION KNOWN TO HAVE EXISTED HERE'S JUST A SURVIVAL
0339-132717-0058 DANGER ENOUGH TERRY AND WE'LL HAVE TO BE MIGHTY CAREFUL WOMEN OF THAT STAGE OF CULTURE ARE QUITE ABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND HAVE NO WELCOME FOR UNSEASONABLE VISITORS WE TALKED AND TALKED AND WITH ALL MY AIRS OF SOCIOLOGICAL SUPERIORITY
0339-132717-0059 ON THE OCEAN VOYAGE AND THE RIVER VOYAGE TOO ADMITTING THE IMPROBABILITY WE'D BEGIN SOLEMNLY AND THEN LAUNCH OUT AGAIN THEY WOULD FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES TERRY INSISTED WOMEN ALWAYS DO
0339-132717-0060 WE MUSTN'T LOOK TO FIND ANY SORT OF ORDER AND ORGANIZATION YOU'RE DEAD WRONG JEFF TOLD HIM
0339-132717-0061 OH CLOTH WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SPINSTERS BUT THERE THEY STOP YOU'LL SEE WE JOKED TERRY ABOUT HIS MODEST IMPRESSION THAT HE WOULD BE WARMLY RECEIVED BUT HE HELD HIS GROUND YOU'LL SEE HE INSISTED
0339-132717-0062 COULDN'T RISK IT HE ASSERTED SOLEMNLY YOU MIGHT START A REVOLUTION
0339-132717-0063 NO YOU'LL HAVE TO BE BEHEADED OR BOWSTRUNG OR WHATEVER THE POPULAR METHOD OF EXECUTION IS YOU'D HAVE TO DO IT YOURSELF REMEMBER GRINNED JEFF NO HUSKY BLACK SLAVES AND MAMELUKES
0339-132717-0064 EH VAN JEFF'S IDEAS AND TERRY'S WERE SO FAR APART THAT SOMETIMES IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO KEEP THE PEACE BETWEEN THEM JEFF IDEALIZED WOMEN IN THE BEST SOUTHERN STYLE HE WAS FULL OF CHIVALRY AND SENTIMENT AND ALL THAT AND HE WAS A GOOD BOY
0339-132717-0065 HE LIVED UP TO HIS IDEALS YOU MIGHT SAY TERRY DID TOO IF YOU CAN CALL HIS VIEWS ABOUT WOMEN ANYTHING SO POLITE AS IDEALS I ALWAYS LIKED TERRY HE WAS A MAN'S MAN VERY MUCH SO GENEROUS AND BRAVE AND CLEVER BUT
0339-132717-0066 I DON'T THINK ANY OF US IN COLLEGE DAYS WAS QUITE PLEASED TO HAVE HIM WITH OUR SISTERS WE WEREN'T VERY STRINGENT HEAVENS NO BUT TERRY WAS THE LIMIT LATER ON WHY OF COURSE A MAN'S LIFE IS HIS OWN
0339-132717-0067 WE HELD AND ASKED NO QUESTIONS BUT BARRING A POSSIBLE EXCEPTION IN FAVOR OF A NOT IMPOSSIBLE WIFE OR OF HIS MOTHER OR OF COURSE THE FAIR RELATIVES OF HIS FRIENDS TERRY'S IDEA SEEMED TO BE THAT
0339-132717-0068 IT WAS REALLY UNPLEASANT SOMETIMES TO SEE THE NOTIONS HE HAD BUT I GOT OUT OF PATIENCE WITH JEFF TOO HE HAD SUCH ROSE COLORED HALOS ON HIS WOMENFOLKS
0339-132717-0069 AND USED TO ARGUE LEARNEDLY ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS OF THE SEX WE WERE NOT IN THE LEAST ADVANCED ON THE WOMAN QUESTION
0339-132717-0070 SO WE JOKED AND DISPUTED AND SPECULATED AND AFTER AN INTERMINABLE JOURNEY WE GOT TO OUR OLD CAMPING PLACE AT LAST
0339-132717-0071 AND IT WAS NAVIGABLE AS FAR AS THE LAKE WHEN WE REACHED THAT AND SLID OUT ON ITS BROAD GLISTENING BOSOM WITH THAT HIGH GRAY PROMONTORY RUNNING OUT TOWARD US AND THE STRAIGHT WHITE FALL CLEARLY VISIBLE IT BEGAN TO BE REALLY EXCITING
0339-132717-0072 SO WE GOT THE BIG BIPLANE TOGETHER AND LOADED IT WITH OUR SCIENTIFICALLY COMPRESSED BAGGAGE THE CAMERA OF COURSE THE GLASSES A SUPPLY OF CONCENTRATED FOOD OUR POCKETS WERE MAGAZINES OF SMALL NECESSITIES AND WE HAD OUR GUNS OF COURSE THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
0339-132717-0073 WITH YOUR TREMENDOUS SPEED WE CAN REACH THAT RANGE AND BACK ALL RIGHT THEN WE CAN LEAVE A SORT OF
0339-132717-0074 AND FROM WHAT WE COULD SEE OF THE SIDES AND THAT ICY RIDGE AT THE BACK END
0339-132717-0075 BUT WE WERE TOO HIGH AND GOING TOO FAST TO SEE MUCH IT APPEARED TO BE WELL FORESTED ABOUT THE EDGES BUT IN THE INTERIOR THERE WERE WIDE PLAINS AND EVERYWHERE PARKLIKE MEADOWS AND OPEN PLACES THERE WERE CITIES TOO THAT I INSISTED
0339-132717-0076 AND SEE THE BROAD FAIR LAND AT OUR PLEASURE SEMITROPICAL
0339-132717-0077 TERRY WAS STUDYING THE FOREST GROWTH
0339-132717-0078 OUR INSTRUMENTS MEASURED IT CLEARLY WE HAD NOT REALIZED THE LONG GENTLE RISE FROM THE COAST PERHAPS
0339-132717-0079 NOW FOR THE FOLKS I'VE HAD ENOUGH SCENERY SO WE SAILED LOW CROSSING BACK AND FORTH QUARTERING THE COUNTRY AS WE WENT AND STUDYING IT WE SAW I CAN'T REMEMBER NOW HOW MUCH OF THIS WE NOTED THEN AND HOW MUCH WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY OUR LATER KNOWLEDGE
0339-132717-0080 BUT WE COULD NOT HELP SEEING THIS MUCH EVEN ON THAT EXCITED DAY A LAND IN A STATE OF PERFECT CULTIVATION WHERE EVEN THE FORESTS LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE CARED FOR A LAND THAT LOOKED LIKE AN ENORMOUS PARK
0339-132717-0081 ONLY IT WAS EVEN MORE EVIDENTLY AN ENORMOUS GARDEN
0339-132717-0082 I SUGGESTED BUT TERRY WAS SILENT WE WERE APPROACHING A VILLAGE I CONFESS THAT WE PAID SMALL ATTENTION TO THE CLEAN WELL BUILT ROADS TO THE ATTRACTIVE ARCHITECTURE TO THE ORDERED BEAUTY OF THE LITTLE TOWN
0339-132717-0083 WE HAD OUR GLASSES OUT EVEN TERRY
0339-132717-0084 THEY HEARD OUR WHIRRING SCREW THEY RAN OUT OF THE HOUSES THEY GATHERED IN FROM THE FIELDS SWIFT RUNNING LIGHT FIGURES CROWDS OF THEM WE STARED AND STARED UNTIL IT WAS ALMOST TOO LATE TO CATCH THE LEVERS SWEEP OFF AND RISE AGAIN
0339-132717-0085 AND THEN WE HELD OUR PEACE FOR A LONG RUN UPWARD GOSH SAID TERRY AFTER A WHILE ONLY WOMEN THERE AND CHILDREN JEFF URGED EXCITEDLY
0339-132717-0086 HE REFUSED TO LISTEN TO JEFF'S SUGGESTION THAT WE EXAMINE THE COUNTRY FURTHER BEFORE WE RISKED LEAVING OUR MACHINE
0339-132717-0087 AND IT WAS AN EXCELLENT ONE A WIDE FLAT TOPPED ROCK OVERLOOKING THE LAKE AND QUITE OUT OF SIGHT FROM THE INTERIOR THEY WON'T FIND THIS IN A HURRY HE ASSERTED AS WE SCRAMBLED WITH THE UTMOST DIFFICULTY DOWN TO SAFER FOOTING COME ON BOYS THERE WERE SOME GOOD LOOKERS IN THAT BUNCH OF COURSE
0339-132717-0088 IT WAS QUITE EASY TO SEE AFTERWARD THAT OUR BEST PLAN WAS TO HAVE STUDIED THE COUNTRY MORE FULLY BEFORE WE LEFT OUR SWOOPING AIRSHIP AND TRUSTED OURSELVES TO MERE FOOT SERVICE BUT WE WERE THREE YOUNG MEN
0339-132717-0089 WE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY FOR OVER A YEAR HARDLY BELIEVING THAT THERE WAS SUCH A PLACE AND NOW WE WERE IN IT
0339-132717-0090 THOUGH SOME WERE TERRIFIED ENOUGH THERE WAS GREAT BEAUTY
0339-132718-0000 RASH ADVANCES NOT MORE THAN TEN OR FIFTEEN MILES WE JUDGED IT FROM OUR LANDING ROCK TO THAT LAST VILLAGE FOR ALL OUR EAGERNESS WE THOUGHT IT WISE TO KEEP TO THE WOODS AND GO CAREFULLY
0339-132718-0001 EVEN TERRY'S ARDOR WAS HELD IN CHECK BY HIS FIRM CONVICTION THAT THERE WERE MEN TO BE MET AND WE SAW TO IT THAT EACH OF US HAD A GOOD STOCK OF CARTRIDGES THEY MAY BE SCARCE AND THEY MAY BE HIDDEN AWAY SOMEWHERE SOME KIND OF
0339-132718-0002 FOR THAT MATTER THEY MAY LIVE UP IN THE MOUNTAINS YONDER AND KEEP THE WOMEN IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY SORT OF A NATIONAL HAREM BUT THERE ARE MEN SOMEWHERE DIDN'T YOU SEE THE BABIES WE HAD ALL SEEN BABIES CHILDREN BIG AND LITTLE
0339-132718-0003 FIRST TIE YOUR CAMEL AND THEN TRUST IN THE LORD JEFF MURMURED SO WE ALL HAD OUR WEAPONS IN HAND AND STOLE CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE FOREST TERRY STUDIED IT AS WE PROGRESSED TALK OF CIVILIZATION
0339-132718-0004 HE CRIED SOFTLY IN RESTRAINED ENTHUSIASM I NEVER SAW A FOREST SO PETTED EVEN IN
0339-132718-0005 THE REST SPLENDID HARDWOOD CALL THIS A FOREST IT'S A TRUCK FARM GOOD THING TO HAVE A BOTANIST ON HAND I AGREED SURE THERE ARE NO MEDICINAL ONES OR ANY FOR PURE ORNAMENT AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY WERE QUITE RIGHT
0339-132718-0006 THESE TOWERING TREES WERE UNDER AS CAREFUL CULTIVATION AS SO MANY CABBAGES IN OTHER CONDITIONS
0339-132718-0007 AND FRUIT GATHERERS BUT AN AIRSHIP IS A CONSPICUOUS OBJECT AND BY NO MEANS QUIET AND WOMEN ARE CAUTIOUS
0339-132718-0008 A LITTLE HAPPY SOUND INSTANTLY SMOTHERED WE STOOD LIKE SO MANY POINTERS AND THEN USED OUR GLASSES SWIFTLY CAREFULLY
0339-132718-0009 THERE WAS A VERY LARGE AND BEAUTIFUL TREE IN THE GLADE WE HAD JUST ENTERED WITH THICK WIDE SPREADING BRANCHES THAT SLOPED OUT IN LAPPING FANS LIKE A BEECH OR PINE IT WAS TRIMMED UNDERNEATH SOME TWENTY FEET UP AND STOOD THERE LIKE A HUGE UMBRELLA
0339-132718-0010 WITH CIRCLING SEATS BENEATH LOOK HE PURSUED THERE ARE SHORT STUMPS OF BRANCHES LEFT TO CLIMB ON THERE'S SOMEONE UP THAT TREE I BELIEVE WE STOLE NEAR CAUTIOUSLY
0339-132718-0011 THERE AMONG THE BOUGHS OVERHEAD WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN ONE SOMETHING THAT CLUNG MOTIONLESS CLOSE TO THE GREAT TRUNK AT FIRST AND THEN AS ONE AND ALL WE STARTED UP THE TREE
0339-132718-0012 SEPARATED INTO THREE SWIFT MOVING FIGURES AND FLED UPWARD AS WE CLIMBED WE COULD CATCH GLIMPSES OF THEM SCATTERING ABOVE US BY THE TIME WE HAD REACHED ABOUT AS FAR AS THREE MEN TOGETHER DARED PUSH THEY HAD LEFT THE MAIN TRUNK AND MOVED OUTWARD
0339-132718-0013 EACH ONE BALANCED ON A LONG BRANCH THAT DIPPED AND SWAYED BENEATH THE WEIGHT WE PAUSED UNCERTAIN IF WE PURSUED FURTHER THE BOUGHS WOULD BREAK UNDER THE DOUBLE BURDEN WE MIGHT SHAKE THEM OFF PERHAPS BUT NONE OF US WAS SO INCLINED
0339-132718-0014 IN THE SOFT DAPPLED LIGHT OF THESE HIGH REGIONS BREATHLESS WITH OUR RAPID CLIMB WE RESTED AWHILE EAGERLY STUDYING OUR OBJECTS OF PURSUIT WHILE THEY IN TURN WITH NO MORE TERROR THAN A SET OF FROLICSOME CHILDREN IN A GAME OF TAG
0339-132718-0015 ON THEIR PRECARIOUS PERCHES AND FRANKLY CURIOUSLY STARED AT US GIRLS WHISPERED JEFF UNDER HIS BREATH
0339-132718-0016 PEACHES ADDED TERRY SCARCELY LOUDER PEACHERINOS APRICOT NECTARINES WHEW THEY WERE GIRLS OF COURSE NO BOYS COULD EVER HAVE SHOWN THAT SPARKLING BEAUTY AND YET
0339-132718-0017 NONE OF US WAS CERTAIN AT FIRST WE SAW SHORT HAIR HATLESS LOOSE AND SHINING A SUIT OF SOME LIGHT FIRM STUFF THE CLOSEST OF TUNICS AND KNEEBREECHES MET BY TRIM GAITERS
0339-132718-0018 AS BRIGHT AND SMOOTH AS PARROTS AND AS UNAWARE OF DANGER THEY SWUNG THERE BEFORE US WHOLLY AT EASE STARING AS WE STARED TILL FIRST ONE AND THEN ALL OF THEM BURST INTO PEALS OF DELIGHTED LAUGHTER
0339-132718-0019 THEN THERE WAS A TORRENT OF SOFT TALK TOSSED BACK AND FORTH NO SAVAGE SING SONG BUT CLEAR MUSICAL FLUENT SPEECH WE MET THEIR LAUGHTER CORDIALLY AND DOFFED OUR HATS TO THEM AT WHICH THEY LAUGHED AGAIN
0339-132718-0020 DELIGHTEDLY THEN TERRY WHOLLY IN HIS ELEMENT MADE A POLITE SPEECH WITH EXPLANATORY GESTURES AND PROCEEDED TO INTRODUCE US WITH POINTING FINGER MISTER JEFF MARGRAVE HE SAID CLEARLY
0339-132718-0021 I ALSO TRIED TO MAKE AN EFFECTIVE SALUTE AND NEARLY LOST MY BALANCE
0339-132718-0022 A FINE CHEST HE HAD TOO AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF HE WAS BRACED CAREFULLY FOR THE OCCASION AND ACHIEVED AN EXCELLENT OBEISANCE AGAIN THEY LAUGHED DELIGHTEDLY AND THE ONE NEAREST ME FOLLOWED HIS TACTICS
0339-132718-0023 SHE LAID A FIRM DELICATE HAND ON HER GOLD GREEN JERKIN ELLADOR THIS WAS PLEASANT BUT WE GOT NO NEARER WE CAN'T SIT HERE AND LEARN THE LANGUAGE TERRY PROTESTED
0339-132718-0024 HE SUGGESTED BY SIGNS THAT WE ALL GO DOWN TOGETHER BUT AGAIN THEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS STILL MERRILY THEN ELLADOR CLEARLY INDICATED THAT WE SHOULD GO DOWN POINTING TO EACH AND ALL OF US WITH UNMISTAKABLE FIRMNESS AND FURTHER
0339-132718-0025 HE PRODUCED FROM AN INNER POCKET A LITTLE BOX OF PURPLE VELVET THAT OPENED WITH A SNAP AND OUT OF IT HE DREW A LONG SPARKLING THING
0339-132718-0026 OFFERED IT FIRST TO ONE THEN TO ANOTHER HOLDING IT OUT AS FAR AS HE COULD REACH TOWARD THE GIRL NEAREST HIM HE STOOD BRACED IN THE FORK HELD FIRMLY BY ONE HAND THE OTHER SWINGING HIS BRIGHT TEMPTATION REACHED FAR OUT ALONG THE BOUGH
0339-132718-0027 BUT NOT QUITE TO HIS FULL STRETCH SHE WAS VISIBLY MOVED I NOTED HESITATED SPOKE TO HER COMPANIONS THEY CHATTERED SOFTLY TOGETHER
0339-132718-0028 THEN SOFTLY AND SLOWLY SHE DREW NEARER THIS WAS ALIMA A TALL LONG LIMBED LASS WELL KNIT AND EVIDENTLY BOTH STRONG AND AGILE HER EYES WERE SPLENDID WIDE FEARLESS
0339-132718-0029 AS FREE FROM SUSPICION AS A CHILD'S WHO HAS NEVER BEEN REBUKED HER INTEREST WAS MORE THAT OF AN INTENT BOY PLAYING A FASCINATING GAME THAN OF A GIRL LURED BY AN ORNAMENT THE OTHERS MOVED A BIT FARTHER OUT HOLDING FIRMLY WATCHING
0339-132718-0030 TERRY'S SMILE WAS IRREPROACHABLE BUT I DID NOT LIKE THE LOOK IN HIS EYES IT WAS LIKE A CREATURE ABOUT TO SPRING I COULD ALREADY SEE IT HAPPEN THE DROPPED NECKLACE THE SUDDEN CLUTCHING HAND THE GIRL'S SHARP CRY AS HE SEIZED HER AND DREW HER IN BUT IT
0339-132718-0031 DIDN'T HAPPEN SHE MADE A TIMID REACH WITH HER RIGHT HAND FOR THE GAY SWINGING THING HE HELD IT A LITTLE NEARER THEN SWIFT AS LIGHT SHE SEIZED IT FROM HIM WITH HER LEFT AND DROPPED ON THE INSTANT TO THE BOUGH BELOW HE MADE HIS SNATCH QUITE VAINLY
0339-132718-0032 ALMOST LOSING HIS POSITION AS HIS HAND CLUTCHED ONLY AIR AND THEN WITH INCONCEIVABLE RAPIDITY THE THREE BRIGHT CREATURES WERE GONE THEY DROPPED FROM THE ENDS OF THE BIG BOUGHS TO THOSE BELOW FAIRLY POURING THEMSELVES OFF THE TREE
0339-132718-0033 WHILE WE CLIMBED DOWNWARD AS SWIFTLY AS WE COULD WE HEARD THEIR VANISHING GAY LAUGHTER WE SAW THEM FLEETING AWAY IN THE WIDE OPEN REACHES OF THE FOREST AND GAVE CHASE BUT WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE CHASED WILD ANTELOPES SO WE STOPPED AT LENGTH SOMEWHAT BREATHLESS
0339-132718-0034 MY WORD THE MEN OF THIS COUNTRY MUST BE GOOD SPRINTERS INHABITANTS EVIDENTLY ARBOREAL I GRIMLY SUGGESTED CIVILIZED AND STILL ARBOREAL PECULIAR PEOPLE
0339-132718-0035 THEY WERE PERFECTLY FRIENDLY NOW WE'VE SCARED THEM BUT IT WAS NO USE GRUMBLING AND TERRY REFUSED TO ADMIT ANY MISTAKE NONSENSE HE SAID THEY EXPECTED IT WOMEN LIKE TO BE RUN AFTER
0339-132718-0036 THIS DIRECTION AND NOT FAR FROM THE WOODS AS I REMEMBER WHEN WE REACHED THE EDGE OF THE OPEN COUNTRY WE RECONNOITERED WITH OUR FIELD GLASSES THERE IT WAS ABOUT FOUR MILES OFF THE SAME TOWN WE CONCLUDED UNLESS AS JEFF VENTURED THEY ALL HAD PINK HOUSES
0501-125127-0000 THE BIRD OF PREY BROUGHT DOWN COLD ON THE SHORE IN THE RAW COLD OF THAT LEADEN CRISIS IN THE FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS WHEN THE VITAL FORCE OF ALL THE NOBLEST AND PRETTIEST THINGS THAT LIVE IS AT ITS LOWEST
0501-125127-0001 THE THREE WATCHERS LOOKED EACH AT THE BLANK FACES OF THE OTHER TWO
0501-125127-0002 GAFFER'S BOAT GAFFER IN LUCK AGAIN AND YET NO GAFFER SO SPAKE RIDERHOOD STARING DISCONSOLATE
0501-125127-0003 IT WAS FAINTER AND DULLER PERHAPS FIRE LIKE THE HIGHER ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE IT HELPS TO SUSTAIN HAS ITS GREATEST TENDENCY TOWARDS DEATH WHEN THE NIGHT IS DYING AND THE DAY IS NOT YET BORN
0501-125127-0004 IF IT WAS ME THAT HAD THE LAW OF THIS HERE JOB IN HAND GROWLED RIDERHOOD WITH A THREATENING SHAKE OF HIS HEAD BLEST IF I WOULDN'T LAY HOLD OF HER AT ANY RATE AY BUT IT IS NOT YOU SAID EUGENE
0501-125127-0005 WITH SOMETHING SO SUDDENLY FIERCE IN HIM THAT THE INFORMER RETURNED SUBMISSIVELY WELL WELL WELL T'OTHER GOVERNOR I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS A MAN MAY SPEAK AND VERMIN MAY BE SILENT SAID EUGENE
0501-125127-0006 HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU WATER RAT ASTONISHED BY HIS FRIEND'S UNUSUAL HEAT LIGHTWOOD STARED TOO AND THEN SAID WHAT CAN HAVE BECOME OF THIS MAN CAN'T IMAGINE UNLESS HE DIVED OVERBOARD
0501-125127-0007 THE INFORMER WIPED HIS BROW RUEFULLY AS HE SAID IT SITTING IN HIS BOAT AND ALWAYS STARING DISCONSOLATE DID YOU MAKE HIS BOAT FAST SHE'S FAST ENOUGH TILL THE TIDE RUNS BACK I COULDN'T MAKE HER FASTER THAN SHE IS
0501-125127-0008 COME ABOARD OF MINE AND SEE FOR YOUR OWN SELVES THERE WAS A LITTLE BACKWARDNESS IN COMPLYING FOR THE FREIGHT LOOKED TOO MUCH FOR THE BOAT BUT ON RIDERHOOD'S PROTESTING
0501-125127-0009 THAT HE HAD HAD HALF A DOZEN DEAD AND ALIVE IN HER AFORE NOW AND SHE WAS NOTHING DEEP IN THE WATER NOR DOWN IN THE STERN EVEN THEN TO SPEAK OF THEY CAREFULLY TOOK THEIR PLACES AND TRIMMED THE CRAZY THING WHILE THEY WERE DOING SO RIDERHOOD STILL SAT STARING DISCONSOLATE
0501-125127-0010 ALL RIGHT GIVE WAY SAID LIGHTWOOD GIVE WAY BY GEORGE REPEATED RIDERHOOD BEFORE SHOVING OFF IF HE'S GONE AND MADE OFF ANY HOW LAWYER LIGHTWOOD IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE ME GIVE WAY IN A DIFFERENT MANNER
0501-125127-0011 BUT HE ALWAYS WAS A CHEAT CON FOUND HIM HE ALWAYS WAS A INFERNAL CHEAT WAS GAFFER NOTHING STRAIGHTFOR'ARD NOTHING ON THE SQUARE SO MEAN SO UNDERHANDED NEVER GOING THROUGH WITH A THING NOR CARRYING IT OUT LIKE A MAN HALLO STEADY
0501-125127-0012 AS THEY BUMPED HEAVILY AGAINST A PILE AND THEN IN A LOWER VOICE REVERSED HIS LATE APOSTROPHE BY REMARKING I WISH THE BOAT OF MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND MAY BE ENDOWED WITH PHILANTHROPY ENOUGH NOT TO TURN BOTTOM UPWARD AND EXTINGUISH US STEADY STEADY SIT CLOSE MORTIMER
0501-125127-0013 THAT HE DROPPED UNDER THE LEE OF A TIER OF SHIPPING AND THEY LAY THERE UNTIL IT WAS OVER THE SQUALL HAD COME UP LIKE A SPITEFUL MESSENGER BEFORE THE MORNING THERE FOLLOWED IN ITS WAKE A RAGGED TEAR OF LIGHT WHICH RIPPED THE DARK CLOUDS UNTIL THEY SHOWED A GREAT GREY HOLE OF DAY
0501-125127-0014 THEY WERE ALL SHIVERING AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM SEEMED TO BE SHIVERING THE RIVER ITSELF CRAFT RIGGING SAILS SUCH EARLY SMOKE AS THERE YET WAS ON THE SHORE BLACK WITH WET AND ALTERED TO THE EYE BY WHITE PATCHES OF HAIL AND SLEET
0501-125127-0015 THE HUDDLED BUILDINGS LOOKED LOWER THAN USUAL AS IF THEY WERE COWERING AND HAD SHRUNK WITH THE COLD VERY LITTLE LIFE WAS TO BE SEEN ON EITHER BANK WINDOWS AND DOORS WERE SHUT
0501-125127-0016 ALL THE OBJECTS AMONG WHICH THEY CREPT WERE SO HUGE IN CONTRAST WITH THEIR WRETCHED BOAT AS TO THREATEN TO CRUSH IT NOT A SHIP'S HULL WITH ITS RUSTY IRON LINKS OF CABLE RUN OUT OF HAWSE HOLES LONG DISCOLOURED WITH THE IRON'S RUSTY TEARS
0501-125127-0017 BUT SEEMED TO BE THERE WITH A FELL INTENTION NOT A FIGURE HEAD BUT HAD THE MENACING LOOK OF BURSTING FORWARD TO RUN THEM DOWN NOT A SLUICE GATE
0501-125127-0018 THAT'S TO DROWN YOU IN MY DEARS NOT A LUMBERING BLACK BARGE WITH ITS CRACKED AND BLISTERED SIDE IMPENDING OVER THEM BUT SEEMED TO SUCK AT THE RIVER WITH A THIRST FOR SUCKING THEM UNDER AND EVERYTHING SO VAUNTED THE SPOILING INFLUENCES OF WATER
0501-125127-0019 DISCOLOURED COPPER ROTTEN WOOD HONEY COMBED STONE GREEN DANK DEPOSIT THAT THE AFTER CONSEQUENCES OF BEING CRUSHED SUCKED UNDER AND DRAWN DOWN LOOKED AS UGLY TO THE IMAGINATION AS THE MAIN EVENT
0501-125127-0020 SOME HALF HOUR OF THIS WORK AND RIDERHOOD UNSHIPPED HIS SCULLS STOOD HOLDING ON TO A BARGE AND HAND OVER HAND LONG WISE ALONG THE BARGE'S SIDE GRADUALLY WORKED HIS BOAT UNDER HER HEAD INTO A SECRET LITTLE NOOK OF SCUMMY WATER
0501-125127-0021 AND DRIVEN INTO THAT NOOK AND WEDGED AS HE HAD DESCRIBED WAS GAFFER'S BOAT THAT BOAT WITH THE STAIN STILL IN IT BEARING SOME RESEMBLANCE TO A MUFFLED HUMAN FORM NOW TELL ME I'M A LIAR SAID THE HONEST MAN
0501-125127-0022 WITH A MORBID EXPECTATION MURMURED EUGENE TO LIGHTWOOD THAT SOMEBODY IS ALWAYS GOING TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH THIS IS HEXAM'S BOAT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR
0501-125127-0023 LOOK AT THE BROKEN SCULL LOOK AT THE T'OTHER SCULL GONE NOW TELL ME I AM A LIAR SAID THE HONEST MAN MISTER INSPECTOR STEPPED INTO THE BOAT EUGENE AND MORTIMER LOOKED ON AND SEE NOW
0501-125127-0024 ADDED RIDERHOOD CREEPING AFT AND SHOWING A STRETCHED ROPE MADE FAST THERE AND TOWING OVERBOARD DIDN'T I TELL YOU HE WAS IN LUCK AGAIN HAUL IN SAID MISTER INSPECTOR EASY TO SAY HAUL IN ANSWERED RIDERHOOD
0501-125127-0025 NOT SO EASY DONE HIS LUCK'S GOT FOULED UNDER THE KEELS OF THE BARGES I TRIED TO HAUL IN LAST TIME BUT I COULDN'T SEE HOW TAUT THE LINE IS
0501-125127-0026 TRY EASY NOW HE TRIED EASY NOW BUT THE LUCK RESISTED WOULDN'T COME I MEAN TO HAVE IT AND THE BOAT TOO SAID MISTER INSPECTOR PLAYING THE LINE BUT STILL THE LUCK RESISTED WOULDN'T COME TAKE CARE SAID RIDERHOOD
0501-125127-0027 YOU'LL DISFIGURE OR PULL ASUNDER PERHAPS I AM NOT GOING TO DO EITHER NOT EVEN TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER SAID MISTER INSPECTOR BUT I MEAN TO HAVE IT COME
0501-125127-0028 IT'S NO GOOD THIS SORT OF GAME YOU KNOW YOU MUST COME UP I MEAN TO HAVE YOU THERE WAS SO MUCH VIRTUE IN THIS DISTINCTLY AND DECIDEDLY MEANING TO HAVE IT THAT IT YIELDED A LITTLE EVEN WHILE THE LINE WAS PLAYED I TOLD YOU SO QUOTH MISTER INSPECTOR PULLING OFF HIS OUTER COAT
0501-125127-0029 AND LEANING WELL OVER THE STERN WITH A WILL COME IT WAS AN AWFUL SORT OF FISHING BUT IT NO MORE DISCONCERTED MISTER INSPECTOR THAN IF HE HAD BEEN FISHING IN A PUNT ON A SUMMER EVENING BY SOME SOOTHING WEIR HIGH UP THE PEACEFUL RIVER
0501-125127-0030 AFTER CERTAIN MINUTES AND A FEW DIRECTIONS TO THE REST TO EASE HER A LITTLE FOR'ARD AND NOW EASE HER A TRIFLE AFT AND THE LIKE HE SAID COMPOSEDLY ALL CLEAR AND THE LINE AND THE BOAT CAME FREE TOGETHER
0501-125127-0031 ACCEPTING LIGHTWOOD'S PROFFERED HAND TO HELP HIM UP HE THEN PUT ON HIS COAT AND SAID TO RIDERHOOD HAND ME OVER THOSE SPARE SCULLS OF YOURS AND I'LL PULL THIS IN TO THE NEAREST STAIRS GO AHEAD YOU AND KEEP OUT IN PRETTY OPEN WATER THAT I MAYN'T GET FOULED AGAIN
0501-125127-0032 HIS DIRECTIONS WERE OBEYED AND THEY PULLED ASHORE DIRECTLY TWO IN ONE BOAT TWO IN THE OTHER NOW SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AGAIN TO RIDERHOOD WHEN THEY WERE ALL ON THE SLUSHY STONES YOU HAVE HAD MORE PRACTICE IN THIS THAN I HAVE HAD
0501-125127-0033 AND OUGHT TO BE A BETTER WORKMAN AT IT UNDO THE TOW ROPE AND WE'LL HELP YOU HAUL IN RIDERHOOD GOT INTO THE BOAT ACCORDINGLY IT APPEARED AS IF HE HAD SCARCELY HAD A MOMENT'S TIME TO TOUCH THE ROPE OR LOOK OVER THE STERN
0501-125127-0034 WHEN HE CAME SCRAMBLING BACK AS PALE AS THE MORNING AND GASPED OUT BY THE LORD HE'S DONE ME
0501-125127-0035 HE POINTED BEHIND HIM AT THE BOAT AND GASPED TO THAT DEGREE THAT HE DROPPED UPON THE STONES TO GET HIS BREATH GAFFER'S DONE ME IT'S GAFFER THEY RAN TO THE ROPE LEAVING HIM GASPING THERE SOON THE FORM OF THE BIRD OF PREY
0501-125127-0036 DEAD SOME HOURS LAY STRETCHED UPON THE SHORE WITH A NEW BLAST STORMING AT IT AND CLOTTING THE WET HAIR WITH HAIL STONES FATHER WAS THAT YOU CALLING ME FATHER I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU CALL ME TWICE BEFORE

0501-125127-0042 AS HE HAD MANY A TIME LOOKED DOWN ON MANY ANOTHER MAN THE WAY OF IT WAS THIS OF COURSE YOU GENTLEMEN HARDLY FAILED TO OBSERVE THAT HE WAS TOWING BY THE NECK AND ARMS THEY HAD HELPED TO RELEASE THE ROPE AND OF COURSE NOT
0501-125127-0043 AND YOU WILL OBSERVE NOW THAT THIS KNOT WHICH WAS DRAWN CHOCK TIGHT ROUND HIS NECK BY THE STRAIN OF HIS OWN ARMS IS A SLIP KNOT HOLDING IT UP FOR DEMONSTRATION PLAIN ENOUGH
0501-125127-0044 IT HAD THE CURVES AND INDENTATIONS IN IT STILL

0501-125127-0050 HE MAKES IT TOO SECURE AS IT HAPPENS HE IS A LITTLE LONGER ABOUT THIS THAN USUAL HIS HANDS BEING NUMBED
0501-125127-0051 BENDS RIGHT OVER THE STERN AND IN ONE OF THESE HEAVY SQUALLS OR IN THE CROSS SWELL OF TWO STEAMERS OR IN NOT BEING QUITE PREPARED OR THROUGH ALL OR MOST OR SOME GETS A LURCH OVERBALANCES AND GOES HEAD FOREMOST OVERBOARD NOW SEE

0501-125127-0056 EUGENE SAID LIGHTWOOD AND WAS ABOUT TO ADD WE MAY WAIT AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WHEN TURNING HIS HEAD HE FOUND THAT NO EUGENE WAS THERE HE RAISED HIS VOICE AND CALLED EUGENE HOLLOA BUT NO EUGENE REPLIED
0501-125127-0057 IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT NOW AND HE LOOKED ABOUT BUT NO EUGENE WAS IN ALL THE VIEW MISTER INSPECTOR SPEEDILY RETURNING DOWN THE WOODEN STAIRS WITH A POLICE CONSTABLE LIGHTWOOD ASKED HIM IF HE HAD SEEN HIS FRIEND LEAVE THEM MISTER INSPECTOR
0501-125127-0058 COULD NOT EXACTLY SAY THAT HE HAD SEEN HIM GO BUT HAD NOTICED THAT HE WAS RESTLESS SINGULAR AND ENTERTAINING COMBINATION SIR YOUR FRIEND
0501-125127-0059 SAID LIGHTWOOD CAN WE GET ANYTHING HOT TO DRINK WE COULD AND WE DID IN A PUBLIC HOUSE KITCHEN WITH A LARGE FIRE
0501-125127-0060 MISTER INSPECTOR HAVING TO MISTER RIDERHOOD ANNOUNCED HIS OFFICIAL INTENTION OF KEEPING HIS EYE UPON HIM STOOD HIM IN A CORNER OF THE FIREPLACE LIKE A WET UMBRELLA AND TOOK NO FURTHER OUTWARD AND VISIBLE NOTICE OF THAT HONEST MAN
0501-125127-0061 AS MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD SAT BEFORE THE BLAZING FIRE CONSCIOUS OF DRINKING BRANDY AND WATER THEN AND THERE IN HIS SLEEP AND YET AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME DRINKING BURNT SHERRY AT THE SIX JOLLY FELLOWSHIPS AND LYING UNDER THE BOAT ON THE RIVER SHORE AND SITTING IN THE BOAT THAT RIDERHOOD ROWED
0501-125127-0062 AND LISTENING TO THE LECTURE RECENTLY CONCLUDED AND HAVING TO DINE IN THE TEMPLE WITH AN UNKNOWN MAN WHO DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS M H F EUGENE GAFFER HARMON AND SAID HE LIVED AT HAILSTORM
0501-125127-0063 AS HE PASSED THROUGH THESE CURIOUS VICISSITUDES OF FATIGUE AND SLUMBER ARRANGED UPON THE SCALE OF A DOZEN HOURS TO THE SECOND HE BECAME AWARE OF ANSWERING ALOUD A COMMUNICATION OF PRESSING IMPORTANCE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN MADE TO HIM AND THEN TURNED IT INTO A COUGH ON BEHOLDING MISTER INSPECTOR
0501-125127-0064 FOR HE FELT WITH SOME NATURAL INDIGNATION THAT THAT FUNCTIONARY MIGHT OTHERWISE SUSPECT HIM OF HAVING CLOSED HIS EYES OR WANDERED IN HIS ATTENTION HERE JUST BEFORE US YOU SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR I SEE SAID LIGHTWOOD WITH DIGNITY
0501-125127-0065 AND HAD HOT BRANDY AND WATER TOO YOU SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AND THEN CUT OFF AT A GREAT RATE WHO SAID LIGHTWOOD YOUR FRIEND YOU KNOW I KNOW HE REPLIED AGAIN WITH DIGNITY AFTER HEARING IN A MIST THROUGH WHICH MISTER INSPECTOR LOOMED VAGUE AND LARGE
0501-125127-0066 THAT THE OFFICER TOOK UPON HIMSELF TO PREPARE THE DEAD MAN'S DAUGHTER FOR WHAT HAD BEFALLEN IN THE NIGHT AND GENERALLY THAT HE TOOK EVERYTHING UPON HIMSELF MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD STUMBLED IN HIS SLEEP TO A CAB STAND CALLED A CAB

0510-130101-0000 THE YOUTH FELL BACK IN THE PROCESSION UNTIL THE TATTERED SOLDIER WAS NOT IN SIGHT THEN HE STARTED TO WALK ON WITH THE OTHERS BUT HE WAS AMID WOUNDS THE MOB OF MEN WAS BLEEDING
0510-130101-0001 BECAUSE OF THE TATTERED SOLDIER'S QUESTION HE NOW FELT THAT HIS SHAME COULD BE VIEWED HE WAS CONTINUALLY CASTING SIDELONG GLANCES TO SEE IF THE MEN WERE CONTEMPLATING THE LETTERS OF GUILT HE FELT BURNED INTO HIS BROW
0510-130101-0002 AND MEN SLOWING TO HIS DREARY PACE WERE WALKING WITH HIM THEY WERE DISCUSSING HIS PLIGHT QUESTIONING HIM AND GIVING HIM ADVICE IN A DOGGED WAY HE REPELLED THEM

0510-130101-0016 PRESENTLY THE LATTER HEARD A VOICE TALKING SOFTLY NEAR HIS SHOULDER TURNING HE SAW THAT IT BELONGED TO THE TATTERED SOLDIER
0510-130101-0017 THE TALL SOLDIER WEAKLY TRIED TO WRENCH HIMSELF FREE HUH HE SAID VACANTLY HE STARED AT THE YOUTH FOR A MOMENT AT LAST HE SPOKE AS IF DIMLY COMPREHENDING
0510-130101-0018 HE STARTED BLINDLY THROUGH THE GRASS THE YOUTH TURNED ONCE TO LOOK AT THE LASHING RIDERS AND JOUNCING GUNS OF THE BATTERY HE WAS STARTLED FROM THIS VIEW BY A SHRILL OUTCRY FROM THE TATTERED MAN
0510-130101-0019 HE AND THE TATTERED MAN BEGAN A PURSUIT THERE WAS A SINGULAR RACE
0510-130101-0020 JIM JIM WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHAT MAKES YOU DO THIS WAY YOU'LL HURT YERSELF THE SAME PURPOSE WAS IN THE TALL SOLDIER'S FACE
0510-130101-0021 HE PROTESTED IN A DULLED WAY KEEPING HIS EYES FASTENED ON THE MYSTIC PLACE OF HIS INTENTIONS NO NO DON'T TECH ME LEAVE ME BE LEAVE ME BE THE YOUTH AGHAST AND FILLED WITH WONDER AT THE TALL SOLDIER
0510-130101-0022 BEGAN QUAVERINGLY TO QUESTION HIM WHERE YEH GOIN JIM WHAT YOU THINKING ABOUT WHERE YOU GOING TELL ME WON'T YOU JIM THE TALL SOLDIER FACED ABOUT AS UPON RELENTLESS PURSUERS
0510-130101-0023 IN HIS EYES THERE WAS A GREAT APPEAL LEAVE ME BE CAN'T YEH LEAVE ME BE FOR A MINNIT THE YOUTH RECOILED WHY JIM HE SAID IN A DAZED WAY WHAT S THE MATTER WITH YOU
0510-130101-0024 THE TALL SOLDIER TURNED AND LURCHING DANGEROUSLY WENT ON THE YOUTH AND THE TATTERED SOLDIER FOLLOWED SNEAKING AS IF WHIPPED FEELING UNABLE TO FACE THE STRICKEN MAN IF HE SHOULD AGAIN CONFRONT THEM
0510-130101-0025 THEY BEGAN TO HAVE THOUGHTS OF A SOLEMN CEREMONY THERE WAS SOMETHING RITE LIKE IN THESE MOVEMENTS OF THE DOOMED SOLDIER AND THERE WAS A RESEMBLANCE IN HIM TO A DEVOTEE OF A MAD RELIGION BLOOD SUCKING MUSCLE WRENCHING BONE CRUSHING
0510-130101-0026 THEY WERE AWED AND AFRAID THEY HUNG BACK LEST HE HAVE AT COMMAND A DREADFUL WEAPON AT LAST THEY SAW HIM STOP AND STAND MOTIONLESS HASTENING UP THEY PERCEIVED THAT HIS FACE WORE AN EXPRESSION
0510-130101-0027 THEY PAUSED AND STOOD EXPECTANT THERE WAS A SILENCE FINALLY THE CHEST OF THE DOOMED SOLDIER BEGAN TO HEAVE WITH A STRAINED MOTION
0510-130101-0028 IT INCREASED IN VIOLENCE UNTIL IT WAS AS IF AN ANIMAL WAS WITHIN AND WAS KICKING AND TUMBLING FURIOUSLY TO BE FREE
0510-130101-0029 AND ONCE AS HIS FRIEND ROLLED HIS EYES HE SAW SOMETHING IN THEM THAT MADE HIM SINK WAILING TO THE GROUND HE RAISED HIS VOICE IN A LAST SUPREME CALL JIM JIM JIM
0510-130101-0030 LEAVE ME BE THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE WHILE HE WAITED SUDDENLY HIS FORM STIFFENED AND STRAIGHTENED
0510-130101-0031 HE STARED INTO SPACE TO THE TWO WATCHERS THERE WAS A CURIOUS AND PROFOUND DIGNITY IN THE FIRM LINES OF HIS AWFUL FACE HE WAS INVADED BY A CREEPING STRANGENESS THAT SLOWLY ENVELOPED HIM
0510-130101-0032 THEN IT BEGAN TO SWING FORWARD SLOW AND STRAIGHT IN THE MANNER OF A FALLING TREE A SWIFT MUSCULAR CONTORTION MADE THE LEFT SHOULDER STRIKE THE GROUND FIRST
0510-130101-0033 THE BODY SEEMED TO BOUNCE A LITTLE WAY FROM THE EARTH GOD SAID THE TATTERED SOLDIER THE YOUTH HAD WATCHED SPELLBOUND THIS CEREMONY AT THE PLACE OF MEETING
0510-130101-0034 HIS FACE HAD BEEN TWISTED INTO AN EXPRESSION OF EVERY AGONY HE HAD IMAGINED FOR HIS FRIEND HE NOW SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND GOING CLOSER GAZED UPON THE PASTELIKE FACE THE MOUTH WAS OPEN AND THE TEETH
0510-130101-0035 SHOWED IN A LAUGH AS THE FLAP OF THE BLUE JACKET FELL AWAY FROM THE BODY HE COULD SEE THAT THE SIDE LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN CHEWED BY WOLVES THE YOUTH TURNED
0510-130101-0036 WITH SUDDEN LIVID RAGE TOWARD THE BATTLEFIELD HE SHOOK HIS FIST HE SEEMED ABOUT TO DELIVER A PHILIPPIC HELL THE RED SUN WAS PASTED IN THE SKY
0510-130103-0000 HE BECAME AWARE THAT THE FURNACE ROAR OF THE BATTLE WAS GROWING LOUDER GREAT BLOWN CLOUDS HAD FLOATED TO THE STILL HEIGHTS OF AIR BEFORE HIM THE NOISE TOO WAS APPROACHING
0510-130103-0001 THE WOODS FILTERED MEN AND THE FIELDS BECAME DOTTED AS HE ROUNDED A HILLOCK HE PERCEIVED THAT THE ROADWAY WAS NOW A CRYING MASS OF WAGONS TEAMS AND MEN
0510-130103-0002 FROM THE HEAVING TANGLE ISSUED EXHORTATIONS COMMANDS IMPRECATIONS FEAR WAS SWEEPING IT ALL ALONG THE CRACKING WHIPS BIT AND HORSES PLUNGED AND TUGGED
0510-130103-0003 THE WHITE TOPPED WAGONS STRAINED AND STUMBLED IN THEIR EXERTIONS LIKE FAT SHEEP THE YOUTH FELT COMFORTED IN A MEASURE BY THIS SIGHT THEY WERE ALL RETREATING PERHAPS THEN HE WAS NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL
0510-130103-0004 HE SEATED HIMSELF AND WATCHED THE TERROR STRICKEN WAGONS THEY FLED LIKE SOFT UNGAINLY ANIMALS ALL THE ROARERS AND LASHERS SERVED TO HELP HIM TO MAGNIFY THE DANGERS AND HORRORS OF THE ENGAGEMENT
0510-130103-0005 PRESENTLY THE CALM HEAD OF A FORWARD GOING COLUMN OF INFANTRY APPEARED IN THE ROAD IT CAME SWIFTLY ON AVOIDING THE OBSTRUCTIONS GAVE IT THE SINUOUS MOVEMENT OF A SERPENT THE MEN AT THE HEAD
0510-130103-0006 THE RAVING TEAMSTERS SWORE MANY STRANGE OATHS THE COMMANDS TO MAKE WAY HAD THE RING OF A GREAT IMPORTANCE IN THEM THE MEN WERE GOING FORWARD TO THE HEART OF THE DIN THEY WERE TO CONFRONT THE EAGER RUSH OF THE ENEMY
0510-130103-0007 THEY FELT THE PRIDE OF THEIR ONWARD MOVEMENT WHEN THE REMAINDER OF THE ARMY SEEMED TRYING TO DRIBBLE DOWN THIS ROAD THEY TUMBLED TEAMS ABOUT WITH A FINE FEELING THAT IT WAS NO MATTER SO LONG AS THEIR COLUMN GOT TO THE FRONT IN TIME
0510-130103-0008 THIS IMPORTANCE MADE THEIR FACES GRAVE AND STERN AND THE BACKS OF THE OFFICERS WERE VERY RIGID AS THE YOUTH LOOKED AT THEM THE BLACK WEIGHT OF HIS WOE RETURNED TO HIM
0510-130103-0009 HE COULD HAVE WEPT IN HIS LONGINGS HE SEARCHED ABOUT IN HIS MIND FOR AN ADEQUATE MALEDICTION FOR THE INDEFINITE CAUSE THE THING UPON WHICH MEN TURN THE WORDS OF FINAL BLAME IT
0510-130103-0010 WHATEVER IT WAS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM HE SAID THERE LAY THE FAULT THE HASTE OF THE COLUMN TO REACH THE BATTLE SEEMED TO THE FORLORN YOUNG MAN TO BE SOMETHING MUCH FINER THAN STOUT FIGHTING HEROES HE THOUGHT
0510-130103-0011 COULD FIND EXCUSES IN THAT LONG SEETHING LANE THEY COULD RETIRE WITH PERFECT SELF RESPECT AND MAKE EXCUSES TO THE STARS HE WONDERED WHAT THOSE MEN HAD EATEN THAT THEY COULD BE IN SUCH HASTE
0510-130103-0012 TO FORCE THEIR WAY TO GRIM CHANCES OF DEATH AS HE WATCHED HIS ENVY GREW UNTIL HE THOUGHT THAT HE WISHED TO CHANGE LIVES WITH ONE OF THEM HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE USED A TREMENDOUS FORCE HE SAID THROW OFF HIMSELF AND BECOME A BETTER
0510-130103-0013 SWIFT PICTURES OF HIMSELF APART YET IN HIMSELF CAME TO HIM A BLUE DESPERATE FIGURE LEADING LURID CHARGES WITH ONE KNEE FORWARD AND A BROKEN BLADE HIGH A BLUE DETERMINED FIGURE
0510-130103-0014 STANDING BEFORE A CRIMSON AND STEEL ASSAULT GETTING CALMLY KILLED ON A HIGH PLACE BEFORE THE EYES OF ALL HE THOUGHT OF THE MAGNIFICENT PATHOS OF HIS DEAD BODY THESE THOUGHTS UPLIFTED HIM
0510-130103-0015 THE CLANKING ARMS OF THE COLUMN NEAR HIM MADE HIM SOAR ON THE RED WINGS OF WAR FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS SUBLIME HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO START FOR THE FRONT INDEED HE SAW A PICTURE OF HIMSELF
0510-130103-0016 DUST STAINED HAGGARD PANTING FLYING TO THE FRONT AT THE PROPER MOMENT TO SEIZE AND THROTTLE THE DARK LEERING WITCH OF CALAMITY THEN THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE THING BEGAN TO DRAG AT HIM HE HESITATED
0510-130103-0017 BALANCING AWKWARDLY ON ONE FOOT HE HAD NO RIFLE HE COULD NOT FIGHT WITH HIS HANDS SAID HE RESENTFULLY TO HIS PLAN WELL RIFLES COULD BE HAD FOR THE PICKING THEY WERE EXTRAORDINARILY PROFUSE
0510-130103-0018 ALSO HE CONTINUED IT WOULD BE A MIRACLE IF HE FOUND HIS REGIMENT WELL HE COULD FIGHT WITH ANY REGIMENT HE STARTED FORWARD SLOWLY HE STEPPED AS IF HE EXPECTED TO TREAD UPON SOME EXPLOSIVE THING
0510-130103-0019 DOUBTS AND HE WERE STRUGGLING HE WOULD TRULY BE A WORM IF ANY OF HIS COMRADES SHOULD SEE HIM RETURNING THUS THE MARKS OF HIS FLIGHT UPON HIM
0510-130103-0020 THERE WAS A REPLY THAT THE INTENT FIGHTERS DID NOT CARE FOR WHAT HAPPENED REARWARD SAVING THAT NO HOSTILE BAYONETS APPEARED THERE IN THE BATTLE BLUR HIS FACE WOULD IN A WAY BE HIDDEN LIKE THE FACE OF A COWLED MAN
0510-130103-0021 BUT THEN HE SAID THAT HIS TIRELESS FATE WOULD BRING FORTH WHEN THE STRIFE LULLED FOR A MOMENT A MAN TO ASK OF HIM AN EXPLANATION
0510-130103-0022 HE WAS NOT CAST DOWN BY THIS DEFEAT OF HIS PLAN FOR UPON STUDYING THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY HE COULD NOT BUT ADMIT THAT THE OBJECTIONS WERE VERY FORMIDABLE FURTHERMORE VARIOUS AILMENTS HAD BEGUN TO CRY OUT
0510-130103-0023 IN THEIR PRESENCE HE COULD NOT PERSIST IN FLYING HIGH WITH THE WINGS OF WAR THEY RENDERED IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO SEE HIMSELF IN A HEROIC LIGHT HE TUMBLED HEADLONG HE DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD A SCORCHING THIRST
0510-130103-0024 HIS FACE WAS SO DRY AND GRIMY THAT HE THOUGHT HE COULD FEEL HIS SKIN CRACKLE EACH BONE OF HIS BODY HAD AN ACHE IN IT AND SEEMINGLY THREATENED TO BREAK WITH EACH MOVEMENT HIS FEET WERE LIKE TWO SORES
0510-130103-0025 THERE WAS A DULL WEIGHT LIKE FEELING IN HIS STOMACH AND WHEN HE TRIED TO WALK HIS HEAD SWAYED AND HE TOTTERED HE COULD NOT SEE WITH DISTINCTNESS SMALL PATCHES OF GREEN MIST FLOATED BEFORE HIS VISION
0510-130103-0026 WHILE HE HAD BEEN TOSSED BY MANY EMOTIONS HE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF AILMENTS NOW THE BESET HIM
0510-130103-0027 AS HE WAS AT LAST COMPELLED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THEM HIS CAPACITY FOR SELF HATE WAS MULTIPLIED IN DESPAIR HE DECLARED THAT HE WAS NOT LIKE THOSE OTHERS HE NOW CONCEDED IT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD EVER BECOME A HERO
0510-130103-0028 HE WAS A CRAVEN LOON THOSE PICTURES OF GLORY WERE PITEOUS THINGS HE GROANED FROM HIS HEART AND WENT STAGGERING OFF A CERTAIN MOTHLIKE QUALITY WITHIN HIM KEPT HIM IN THE VICINITY OF THE BATTLE
0510-130103-0029 HE HAD A GREAT DESIRE TO SEE AND TO GET NEWS HE WISHED TO KNOW WHO WAS WINNING HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT DESPITE HIS UNPRECEDENTED SUFFERING HE HAD NEVER LOST HIS GREED FOR A VICTORY
0510-130103-0030 THUS MANY MEN OF COURAGE HE CONSIDERED WOULD BE OBLIGED TO DESERT THE COLORS AND SCURRY LIKE CHICKENS HE WOULD APPEAR AS ONE OF THEM THEY WOULD BE SULLEN BROTHERS IN DISTRESS AND HE COULD THEN EASILY BELIEVE
0510-130103-0031 THAT PREVIOUSLY THE ARMY HAD ENCOUNTERED GREAT DEFEATS AND IN A FEW MONTHS HAD SHAKEN OFF ALL BLOOD AND TRADITION OF THEM EMERGING AS BRIGHT AND VALIANT AS A NEW ONE THRUSTING OUT OF SIGHT THE MEMORY OF DISASTER
0510-130103-0032 AND APPEARING WITH THE VALOR AND CONFIDENCE OF UNCONQUERED LEGIONS THE SHRILLING VOICES OF THE PEOPLE AT HOME WOULD PIPE DISMALLY FOR A TIME
0510-130103-0033 AND HE DID NOT CONCEIVE PUBLIC OPINION TO BE ACCURATE AT LONG RANGE IT WAS QUITE PROBABLE THEY WOULD HIT THE WRONG MAN WHO AFTER HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS AMAZEMENT WOULD PERHAPS SPEND THE REST OF HIS DAYS
0510-130103-0034 IN WRITING REPLIES TO THE SONGS OF HIS ALLEGED FAILURE IT WOULD BE VERY UNFORTUNATE NO DOUBT BUT IN THIS CASE A GENERAL WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO THE YOUTH IN A DEFEAT
0510-130103-0035 THERE WOULD BE A ROUNDABOUT VINDICATION OF HIMSELF HE THOUGHT IT WOULD PROVE IN A MANNER THAT HE HAD FLED EARLY BECAUSE OF HIS SUPERIOR POWERS OF PERCEPTION A SERIOUS PROPHET UPON PREDICTING A FLOOD SHOULD BE THE FIRST MAN TO CLIMB A TREE
0510-130103-0036 IF THE ARMY HAD GONE GLORIOUSLY ON HE WOULD BE LOST IF THE DIN MEANT THAT NOW HIS ARMY'S FLAGS WERE TILTED FORWARD HE WAS A CONDEMNED WRETCH HE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO DOOM HIMSELF TO ISOLATION
0510-130103-0037 IF THE MEN WERE ADVANCING THEIR INDIFFERENT FEET WERE TRAMPLING UPON HIS CHANCES FOR A SUCCESSFUL LIFE AS THESE THOUGHTS WENT RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS MIND HE TURNED UPON THEM AND TRIED TO THRUST THEM AWAY
0510-130103-0038 HE DENOUNCED HIMSELF AS A VILLAIN HE SAID THAT HE WAS THE MOST UNUTTERABLY SELFISH MAN IN EXISTENCE HIS MIND PICTURED THE SOLDIERS WHO WOULD PLACE THEIR DEFIANT BODIES BEFORE THE SPEAR OF THE YELLING BATTLE FIEND
0510-130103-0039 AND AS HE SAW THEIR DRIPPING CORPSES ON AN IMAGINED FIELD HE SAID THAT HE WAS THEIR MURDERER AGAIN HE THOUGHT
0510-130103-0040 HE BELIEVED THAT HE ENVIED A CORPSE THINKING OF THE SLAIN HE ACHIEVED A GREAT CONTEMPT FOR SOME OF THEM AS IF THEY WERE GUILTY FOR THUS BECOMING LIFELESS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN KILLED BY LUCKY CHANCES HE SAID
0510-130103-0041 AND THEIR ROBES OF GLORIOUS MEMORIES WERE SHAMS HOWEVER HE STILL SAID THAT IT WAS A GREAT PITY HE WAS NOT AS THEY A DEFEAT OF THE ARMY HAD SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM AS A MEANS OF ESCAPE
0510-130103-0042 FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FALL HE CONSIDERED NOW HOWEVER THAT IT WAS USELESS TO THINK OF SUCH A POSSIBILITY
0510-130103-0043 BUT AS HE MORTALLY FEARED THESE SHAFTS IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO INVENT A TALE HE FELT HE COULD TRUST HE EXPERIMENTED WITH MANY SCHEMES BUT THREW THEM ASIDE ONE BY ONE AS FLIMSY
0510-130103-0044 HE WAS QUICK TO SEE VULNERABLE PLACES IN THEM ALL FURTHERMORE HE WAS MUCH AFRAID THAT SOME ARROW OF SCORN MIGHT LAY HIM MENTALLY LOW BEFORE HE COULD RAISE HIS PROTECTING TALE
0510-130103-0045 HE IMAGINED THE WHOLE REGIMENT SAYING WHERE'S HENRY FLEMING
0510-130103-0046 TO DISCOVER WHEN HE WOULD RUN WHEREVER HE WENT IN CAMP HE WOULD ENCOUNTER INSOLENT AND LINGERINGLY CRUEL STARES AS HE IMAGINED HIMSELF PASSING NEAR A CROWD OF COMRADES HE COULD HEAR ONE SAY
0510-130103-0047 THEN AS IF THE HEADS WERE MOVED BY ONE MUSCLE ALL THE FACES WERE TURNED TOWARD HIM WITH WIDE DERISIVE GRINS HE SEEMED TO HEAR SOME ONE MAKE A HUMOROUS REMARK IN A LOW TONE AT IT THE OTHERS ALL CROWED AND CACKLED
0510-130560-0000 KARMU WAS A FARMER AND DHARMU WAS A TRADER ONCE WHEN DHARMU WAS AWAY FROM HOME KARMU GAVE A RELIGIOUS FEAST AND DID NOT INVITE DHARMU'S HOUSEHOLD WHEN DHARMU RETURNED AND LEARNT THIS
0510-130560-0001 HE TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE ALSO WOULD PERFORM THE CEREMONIES IN HIS HOUSE SO THEY SET TO WORK AND WERE EMPLOYED IN COOKING RICE AND VEGETABLES FAR INTO THE NIGHT
0510-130560-0002 AND KARAM GOSAIN CAME DOWN TO SEE WHAT PREPARATIONS DHARMU WAS MAKING IN HIS HONOUR AND HE WATCHED FROM THE BACK OF THE HOUSE JUST THEN DHARMU STRAINED OFF THE WATER FROM THE COOKED RICE
0510-130560-0003 AND THREW IT OUT OF THE WINDOW AND IT FELL ON KARAM GOSAIN AND SCALDED HIM AND AS THE FLIES AND INSECTS WORRIED THE WOUND KARAM GOSAIN WENT OFF TO THE GANGES AND BURIED HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM
0510-130560-0004 AS HE HAD THUS OFFENDED KARAM GOSAIN ALL DHARMU'S UNDERTAKINGS FAILED AND HE FELL INTO DEEP POVERTY AND HAD NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO EAT SO HE HAD TO TAKE SERVICE WITH HIS BROTHER KARMU
0510-130560-0005 OF THE OTHER LABOURERS AND THE LABOURERS ALSO TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS NOT SUITABLE FOR HIM TO WORK AS A LABOURER HIMSELF BUT DHARMU SAID
0510-130560-0006 AND IN THE SAME WAY DHARMU'S WIFE MIGHT HAVE ACTED AS OVERSEER OF THE WOMEN BUT SHE WAS ASHAMED NOT TO WORK TOO ONE DAY THEY WERE TRANSPLANTING THE RICE AND KARMU BROUGHT OUT BREAKFAST FOR THE LABOURERS
0510-130560-0007 HE TOLD DHARMU AND HIS WIFE TO WASH THEIR HANDS AND COME AND EAT BUT THEY ANSWERED THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE HOUSEHOLD AND THAT THE HIRED LABOURERS SHOULD BE FED FIRST SO THE LABOURERS ATE AND THEY ATE UP ALL THE RICE
0510-130560-0008 AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR DHARMU AND HIS WIFE WHEN THE MIDDAY MEAL WAS BROUGHT THE SAME THING HAPPENED
0510-130560-0009 BUT THEY HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE MADE UP TO THEM WHEN THE WAGES WERE PAID AND WORKED ON FASTING AT EVENING WHEN THEY CAME TO PAY THE WAGES IN KIND DHARMU'S NAME WAS CALLED OUT FIRST
0510-130560-0010 BUT HE TOLD HIS BROTHER TO PAY THE LABOURERS FIRST AND IN DOING THIS THE PADDY WAS ALL USED UP AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR DHARMU AND HIS WIFE SO THEY WENT HOME SORROWFULLY AND THEIR CHILDREN CRIED FOR FOOD
0510-130560-0011 AND THEY HAD NOTHING TO GIVE THEM IN THE NIGHT DHARMU'S WIFE SAID THEY PROMISED TO PAY US FOR MERELY LOOKING AFTER THE WORK AND INSTEAD WE WORKED HARD AND HAVE STILL GOT NOTHING WE WILL NOT WORK FOR THEM ANYMORE
0510-130560-0012 COME LET US UNDO THE WORK WE DID TO DAY YOU CUT DOWN THE EMBANKMENTS YOU REPAIRED AND I WILL UPROOT THE SEEDLINGS WHICH I PLANTED SO THEY WENT OUT INTO THE NIGHT TO DO THIS BUT WHENEVER DHARMU RAISED HIS SPADE A VOICE CALLED OUT
0510-130560-0013 HOLD HOLD AND WHENEVER HIS WIFE PUT OUT HER HAND TO PULL UP THE RICE A VOICE CALLED OUT HOLD HOLD THEN THEY SAID WHO ARE YOU WHO STOP US AND THE VOICE ANSWERED
0510-130560-0014 AND THEY ASKED HOW THEY SHOULD PROPITIATE HIM AND THE VOICE SAID GRIND TURMERIC AND PUT IT ON A PLATE AND BUY NEW CLOTH AND DYE IT WITH TURMERIC AND MAKE READY OIL AND TAKE THESE THINGS TO THE GANGES
0510-130560-0015 AND THEY WENT TO EAT THE FRUIT BUT WHEN THEY GOT NEAR THEY FOUND THAT ALL THE FIGS WERE FULL OF GRUBS AND THEY SANG EXHAUSTED BY HUNGER WE CAME TO A FIG TREE AND FOUND IT FULL OF GRUBS
0510-130560-0016 O KARAM GOSAIN HOW FAR OFF ARE YOU THEN THEY CAME TO A MANGO TREE AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED AND THEY WENT ON AND SAW A COW WITH A CALF AND THEY THOUGHT
0510-130560-0017 O KARAM GOSAIN HOW FAR OFF ARE YOU BUT THE COW SAID TO THEM GO TO THE BANKS OF THE GANGES THEN THEY CAME TO A BUFFALO AND WENT TO MILK IT BUT IT LOWERED ITS HEAD AND CHARGED THEM
0510-130560-0018 AND THE BUFFALO SAID GO ON TO THE BANK OF THE GANGES THEN THEY CAME TO A HORSE AND THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD CATCH IT AND MOUNT IT BUT IT KICKED AND SNORTED AND THEY SANG
0510-130560-0019 AND THEY SAW UNDER A BANYAN TREE A LARGE POT FULL OF RUPEES BUT THEY WERE SO DISHEARTENED THAT THEY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO TOUCH IT THEN THEY MET A WOMAN WHO ASKED WHERE THEY WERE GOING AND WHEN SHE HEARD SHE SAID
0510-130560-0020 THEN THEY MET A WOMAN WITH BOTH HER FEET BURNING IN A FIRE AND ANOTHER WITH A STOOL STUCK FAST TO HER BACK AND THEY PROMISED TO ENQUIRE HOW THESE MIGHT BE DELIVERED
0510-130560-0021 BUT THEY SAID IT IS NO LOW CASTE PERSON BUT DHARMU THEN THEY BATHED HIM AND ANOINTED HIM WITH OIL AND TURMERIC AND WRAPPED HIM IN THE NEW CLOTH WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT AND THUS THEY PERSUADED HIM TO RETURN
0510-130560-0022 SO THEY ROSE UP TO GO BACK AND DHARMU ASKED ABOUT THE WOMEN WHOM THEY HAD MET AND KARAM GOSAIN SAID THE WOMAN HAS A STOOL STUCK TO HER BACK BECAUSE WHEN VISITORS CAME SHE NEVER OFFERED THEM A SEAT
0510-130560-0023 LET HER DO SO IN FUTURE AND SHE WILL BE FREED AND THE WOMAN HAS HER FEET BURNING IN THE FIRE BECAUSE SHE PUSHED THE FUEL INTO THE FIRE WITH HER FOOT LET HER NOT DO SO IN FUTURE AND SHE WILL BE FREED
0510-130560-0024 AND A HORSE AND A BUFFALO AND A COW AND MONEY AND MANGOES AND FIGS AND DHARMU SAID YES BUT THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO CATCH THE ANIMALS AND THE FRUIT WAS BAD
0510-130560-0025 KARAM GOSAIN PROMISED THEM THAT ON THEIR WAY BACK THEY SHOULD TAKE POSSESSION OF ALL AND THEY DID SO AND MOUNTED ON THE ELEPHANT AND RETURNED TO THEIR HOME WITH GREAT WEALTH
0511-131226-0000 ALSO THERE WERE BLUE MOONS
0511-131226-0001 NEVERTHELESS THEY WERE AS COMMON AS WERE GREEN SUNS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE SCIENCE HAD TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE UNCONVENTIONALITIES SUCH PUBLICATIONS AS NATURE AND KNOWLEDGE WERE BESIEGED WITH INQUIRIES
0511-131226-0002 I SUPPOSE IN ALASKA AND IN THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDS ALL THE MEDICINE MEN WERE SIMILARLY UPON TRIAL SOMETHING HAD TO BE THOUGHT OF UPON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THE VOLCANO OF KRAKATOA OF THE STRAITS OF SUNDA
0511-131226-0003 HAD BLOWN UP TERRIFIC WE'RE TOLD THAT THE SOUND WAS HEARD TWO THOUSAND MILES AND THAT THIRTY SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY PERSONS WERE KILLED SEEMS JUST A LITTLE UNSCIENTIFIC OR IMPOSITIVE TO ME
0511-131226-0004 IT IS SAID THAT THESE PHENOMENA WERE CAUSED BY PARTICLES OF VOLCANIC DUST THAT WERE CAST HIGH IN THE AIR BY KRAKATOA THIS IS THE EXPLANATION THAT WAS AGREED UPON IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE BUT FOR SEVEN YEARS THE ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA CONTINUED
0511-131226-0005 EXCEPT THAT IN THE SEVEN THERE WAS A LAPSE OF SEVERAL YEARS AND WHERE WAS THE VOLCANIC DUST ALL THAT TIME
0511-131226-0006 SO HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT SOMETHING IS NOT SOMETHING ELSE WHEN NEITHER IS SOMETHING ELSE SOME OTHER THING THERE'S NOTHING TO PROVE THIS IS ONE OF THE PROFUNDITIES THAT WE ADVERTISED IN ADVANCE
0511-131226-0007 YOU CAN OPPOSE AN ABSURDITY ONLY WITH SOME OTHER ABSURDITY BUT SCIENCE IS ESTABLISHED PREPOSTEROUSNESS WE DIVIDE ALL INTELLECTION THE OBVIOUSLY PREPOSTEROUSNESS AND THE ESTABLISHED BUT KRAKATOA
0511-131226-0008 THAT'S THE EXPLANATION THAT THE SCIENTISTS GAVE
0511-131226-0009 AS MUCH AS IT CAN EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THIS EARTH THIS BOOK IS AN ASSEMBLAGE OF DATA OF EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THIS EARTH WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT OUR DATA HAVE BEEN DAMNED UPON NO CONSIDERATION FOR INDIVIDUAL MERITS OR DEMERITS
0511-131226-0010 BUT IN CONFORMITY WITH A GENERAL ATTEMPT TO HOLD OUT FOR ISOLATION OF THIS EARTH THIS IS ATTEMPTED POSITIVENESS WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT SCIENCE CAN NO MORE SUCCEED THAN
0511-131226-0011 SCIENTISTS HAVE PERPETRATED SUCH AN ENORMITY AS SUSPENSION OF VOLCANIC DUST SEVEN YEARS IN THE AIR DISREGARDING THE LAPSE OF SEVERAL YEARS
0511-131226-0012 THE ARRIVAL OF DUST FROM SOMEWHERE BEYOND THIS EARTH NOT THAT SCIENTISTS THEMSELVES HAVE EVER ACHIEVED POSITIVENESS IN ITS ASPECT OF UNITEDNESS AMONG THEMSELVES BECAUSE NORDENSKIOLD
0511-131226-0013 BEFORE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE WROTE A GREAT DEAL UPON HIS THEORY OF COSMIC DUST AND PROFESSOR CLEVELAND ABBE CONTENDED AGAINST THE KRAKATOAN EXPLANATION BUT THAT THIS IS THE ORTHODOXY OF THE MAIN BODY OF SCIENTISTS
0511-131226-0014 MY OWN CHIEF REASON FOR INDIGNATION HERE THAT THIS PREPOSTEROUS EXPLANATION INTERFERES WITH SOME OF MY OWN ENORMITIES IT WOULD COST ME TOO MUCH EXPLAINING IF I SHOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THIS EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE
0511-131226-0015 FOR INSTANCE THE TURTLE OF VICKSBURG
0511-131226-0016 AND FORTY PLATES SOME OF THEM MARVELOUSLY COLORED IT WAS ISSUED AFTER AN INVESTIGATION THAT TOOK FIVE YEARS YOU COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING DONE MORE EFFICIENTLY ARTISTICALLY AUTHORITATIVELY THE MATHEMATICAL PARTS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPRESSIVE
0511-131226-0017 DISTRIBUTION OF THE DUST OF KRAKATOA VELOCITY OF TRANSLATION
0511-131226-0018 ANNUAL REGISTER
0511-131226-0019 BEFORE THE ERUPTION OCCURRED
0511-131226-0020 THAT THEY WERE SEEN IN NATAL SOUTH AFRICA SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE ERUPTION INERTIA AND ITS INHOSPITALITY OR
0511-131226-0021 RAW MEAT SHOULD NOT BE FED TO BABIES WE SHALL HAVE A FEW DATA INITIATORILY I FEAR ME THAT THE HORSE AND THE BARN WERE A LITTLE EXTREME FOR OUR BUDDING LIBERALITIES THE OUTRAGEOUS IS THE REASONABLE
0511-131226-0022 IF INTRODUCED POLITELY HAILSTONES FOR INSTANCE ONE READS IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF HAILSTONES THE SIZE OF HENS EGGS ONE SMILES NEVERTHELESS I WILL ENGAGE TO LIST ONE HUNDRED INSTANCES FROM THE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
0511-131226-0023 OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE TWO POUNDERS AUTHENTICATED AND SIX POUNDERS REPORTED AT SERINGAPATAM INDIA ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FELL A HAILSTONE
0511-131226-0024 I FEAR ME I FEAR ME THIS IS ONE OF THE PROFOUNDLY DAMNED I BLURT OUT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD PERHAPS BE WITHHELD FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES BUT THAT DAMNED THING WAS THE SIZE OF AN ELEPHANT
0511-131226-0025 ONE SMILES IN MONTANA IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FELL SNOWFLAKES FIFTEEN INCHES ACROSS AND EIGHT INCHES THICK MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW NINETEEN FIFTEEN SEVENTY THREE
0511-131226-0026 IN THE TOPOGRAPHY OF INTELLECTION I SHOULD SAY THAT WHAT WE CALL KNOWLEDGE IS IGNORANCE SURROUNDED BY LAUGHTER BLACK RAINS RED RAINS
0511-131226-0027 THE FALL OF A THOUSAND TONS OF BUTTER JET BLACK SNOW PINK SNOW BLUE HAILSTONES HAILSTONES FLAVORED LIKE ORANGES PUNK AND SILK AND CHARCOAL
0511-131226-0028 ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IF ANYONE WAS SO CREDULOUS AS TO THINK THAT STONES HAD EVER FALLEN FROM THE SKY HE WAS REASONED WITH IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE ARE NO STONES IN THE SKY THEREFORE NO STONES CAN FALL FROM THE SKY
0511-131226-0029 OR NOTHING MORE REASONABLE OR SCIENTIFIC OR LOGICAL THAN THAT COULD BE SAID UPON ANY SUBJECT THE ONLY TROUBLE IS THE UNIVERSAL TROUBLE THAT THE MAJOR PREMISE IS NOT REAL OR IS INTERMEDIATE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN REALNESS
0511-131226-0030 AND UNREALNESS IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO A COMMITTEE OF WHOM LAVOISIER WAS A MEMBER WAS APPOINTED BY THE FRENCH ACADEMY TO INVESTIGATE A REPORT THAT A STONE HAD FALLEN FROM THE SKY AT LUCE FRANCE
0511-131226-0031 THE EXCLUSIONISTS EXPLANATION AT THAT TIME WAS THAT STONES DO NOT FALL FROM THE SKY
0511-131226-0032 AND THAT HOT STONES MAY BE PICKED UP WHERE A LUMINOUS OBJECT SEEMINGLY HAD LANDED ONLY LIGHTNING STRIKING A STONE HEATING EVEN MELTING IT THE STONE OF LUCE SHOWED SIGNS OF FUSION
0511-131226-0033 LAVOISIER'S ANALYSIS ABSOLUTELY PROVED
0511-131226-0034 SO AUTHORITATIVELY FALLING STONES WERE DAMNED THE STOCK MEANS OF EXCLUSION REMAINED THE EXPLANATION OF LIGHTNING THAT WAS SEEN TO STRIKE SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE
0511-131226-0035 BUT POSITIVENESS AND THE FATE OF EVERY POSITIVE STATEMENT IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY TO THINK OF DAMNED STONES RAISING AN OUTCRY AGAINST A SENTENCE OF EXCLUSION BUT SUBJECTIVELY
0511-131226-0036 OR DATA OF THEM BOMBARDED THE WALLS RAISED AGAINST THEM MONTHLY REVIEW
0511-131226-0037 THE PHENOMENON WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE REMARKS BEFORE US WILL SEEM TO MOST PERSONS AS LITTLE WORTHY OF CREDIT AS ANY THAT COULD BE OFFERED THE FALLING OF LARGE STONES FROM THE SKY WITHOUT ANY ASSIGNABLE CAUSE OF THEIR PREVIOUS ASCENT
0511-131226-0038 SEEMS TO PARTAKE SO MUCH OF THE MARVELOUS AS ALMOST ENTIRELY TO EXCLUDE THE OPERATION OF KNOWN AND NATURAL AGENTS YET A BODY OF EVIDENCE IS HERE BROUGHT TO PROVE THAT SUCH EVENTS HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE
0511-131226-0039 THE WRITER ABANDONS THE FIRST OR ABSOLUTE EXCLUSION AND MODIFIES IT WITH THE EXPLANATION THAT THE DAY BEFORE A REPORTED FALL OF STONES IN TUSCANY JUNE SIXTEENTH SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR THERE HAD BEEN AN ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS
0511-131226-0040 IT'S MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS LATER
0511-131226-0041 THAT HAS EVER BEEN ACCEPTABLY TRACED TO TERRESTRIAL ORIGIN FALLING STONES HAD TO BE UNDAMNED
0511-131226-0042 OF OUTSIDE FORCES ONE MAY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF A LAVOISIER AND STILL NOT BE ABLE TO ANALYZE NOT BE ABLE EVEN TO SEE
0511-131226-0043 EXCEPT CONFORMABLY WITH THE HYPNOSES OR THE CONVENTIONAL REACTIONS AGAINST HYPNOSES OF ONE'S ERA WE BELIEVE NO MORE WE ACCEPT
0511-131226-0044 LITTLE BY LITTLE THE WHIRLWIND AND VOLCANO EXPLANATIONS HAD TO BE ABANDONED BUT SO POWERFUL WAS THIS EXCLUSION HYPNOSIS SENTENCE OF DAMNATION OR THIS ATTEMPT AT POSITIVENESS
0511-131226-0045 THAT FAR INTO OUR OWN TIMES SOME SCIENTISTS NOTABLY PROFESSOR LAWRENCE SMITH AND SIR ROBERT BALL CONTINUED TO HOLD OUT AGAINST ALL EXTERNAL ORIGINS ASSERTING THAT NOTHING COULD FALL TO THIS EARTH
0511-131226-0046 BUT THE COMMON IMPRESSION OF THEM IS ONLY A RETREAT OF ATTEMPTED EXCLUSION THAT ONLY TWO KINDS OF SUBSTANCE FALL FROM THE SKY METALLIC AND STONY
0511-131226-0047 AS LATE AS NOVEMBER NINETEEN O TWO
0511-131226-0048 A MEMBER OF THE SELBORNE SOCIETY STILL ARGUED THAT METEORITES DO NOT FALL FROM THE SKY THAT THEY ARE MASSES OF IRON UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT ATTRACT LIGHTNING
0511-131228-0000 VISCOUS AND PUTRID
0511-131228-0001 STORY OF A HIGHLY UNPLEASANT SUBSTANCE THAT HAD FALLEN FROM THE SKY IN WILSON COUNTY TENNESSEE WE READ THAT DOCTOR TROOST VISITED THE PLACE AND INVESTIGATED LATER WE'RE GOING TO INVESTIGATE SOME INVESTIGATIONS
0511-131228-0002 THAT THEY HAD SCATTERED THE DECAYING FLESH OF A DEAD HOG OVER THE TOBACCO FIELDS IF WE DON'T ACCEPT THIS DATUM
0511-131228-0003 IT HAD BEEN EXAMINED AND DESCRIBED BY PROFESSOR GRAVES FORMERLY LECTURER AT DARTMOUTH COLLEGE IT WAS AN OBJECT THAT HAD UPON IT A NAP SIMILAR TO THAT OF MILLED CLOTH UPON REMOVING THIS NAP
0511-131228-0004 A BUFF COLORED PULPY SUBSTANCE WAS FOUND
0511-131228-0005 IS PROFESSOR GRAVES ACCOUNT COMMUNICATED BY PROFESSOR DEWEY THAT UPON THE EVENING OF AUGUST THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN A LIGHT WAS SEEN IN AMHERST A FALLING OBJECT SOUND
0511-131228-0006 THE NEXT MORNING IN PROFESSOR DEWEY'S FRONT YARD IN WHAT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN THE ONLY POSITION FROM WHICH THE LIGHT THAT HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE ROOM THE NIGHT BEFORE COULD HAVE BEEN REFLECTED
0511-131228-0007 WAS FOUND A SUBSTANCE UNLIKE ANYTHING BEFORE OBSERVED BY ANYONE WHO SAW IT IT WAS A BOWL SHAPED OBJECT ABOUT EIGHT INCHES IN DIAMETER AND ONE INCH THICK BRIGHT BUFF COLORED AND HAVING UPON IT A
0511-131228-0008 UPON REMOVING THIS COVERING A BUFF COLORED PULPY SUBSTANCE OF THE CONSISTENCY OF SOFT SOAP WAS FOUND OF AN OFFENSIVE SUFFOCATING SMELL
0511-131228-0009 A FEW MINUTES OF EXPOSURE TO THE AIR CHANGED THE BUFF COLOR TO A LIVID COLOR RESEMBLING VENOUS BLOOD IT ABSORBED MOISTURE QUICKLY FROM THE AIR AND LIQUEFIED FOR SOME OF THE CHEMIC REACTIONS SEE THE JOURNAL
0511-131228-0010 THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BELONG HERE LONDON TIMES APRIL NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX FALL OF FISH THAT HAD OCCURRED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
0511-131228-0011 IT IS SAID THAT THE FISH WERE OF THE CHALWA SPECIES ABOUT A SPAN IN LENGTH AND A SEER IN WEIGHT YOU KNOW THEY WERE DEAD AND DRY OR
0511-131228-0012 EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SO DEFINITELY IDENTIFIED AS OF A KNOWN LOCAL SPECIES OR THEY WERE NOT FISH AT ALL I INCLINE MYSELF TO THE ACCEPTANCE THAT THEY WERE NOT FISH
0511-131228-0013 IT IS SAID THAT WHATEVER THEY WERE THEY COULD NOT BE EATEN THAT IN THE PAN
0511-131228-0014 MAY SIXTEENTH OR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR IS THE DATE GIVEN IN THE JOURNAL
0511-131228-0015 OCCURS THE INEVITABLE DAMNATION OF THE AMHERST OBJECT PROFESSOR EDWARD HITCHCOCK WENT TO LIVE IN AMHERST
0511-131228-0016 HAD BEEN FOUND AT NEARLY THE SAME PLACE PROFESSOR HITCHCOCK WAS INVITED BY PROFESSOR GRAVES TO EXAMINE IT EXACTLY LIKE THE FIRST ONE CORRESPONDED IN SIZE AND COLOR AND CONSISTENCY THE CHEMIC REACTIONS WERE THE SAME PROFESSOR HITCHCOCK
0511-131228-0017 RECOGNIZED IT IN A MOMENT IT WAS A GELATINOUS FUNGUS HE DID NOT SATISFY HIMSELF AS TO JUST THE EXACT SPECIES IT BELONGED TO BUT HE PREDICTED THAT SIMILAR FUNGI MIGHT SPRING UP WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS
0511-131228-0018 BUT BEFORE EVENING TWO OTHERS SPRANG UP OR WE'VE ARRIVED AT ONE OF THE OLDEST OF THE EXCLUSIONISTS CONVENTIONS OR NOSTOC WE SHALL HAVE MANY DATA
0511-131228-0019 ALMOST ALWAYS THE EXCLUSIONISTS ARGUE
0511-131228-0020 AN ALGA OR IN SOME RESPECTS A FUNGOUS GROWTH THE RIVAL CONVENTION IS SPAWN OF FROGS OR OF FISHES THESE TWO CONVENTIONS HAVE MADE A STRONG COMBINATION
0511-131228-0021 WHEN THE TESTIMONY WAS TOO GOOD THAT IT HAD FALLEN
0511-131228-0022 IN A WHIRLWIND NOW I CAN'T SAY THAT NOSTOC IS ALWAYS GREENISH ANY MORE THAN I CAN SAY THAT BLACKBIRDS ARE ALWAYS BLACK HAVING SEEN A WHITE ONE WE SHALL QUOTE A SCIENTIST WHO KNEW OF FLESH COLORED NOSTOC WHEN
0511-131228-0023 SO TO KNOW WAS CONVENIENT WHEN WE COME TO REPORTED FALLS OF GELATINOUS SUBSTANCES I'D LIKE IT TO BE NOTICED HOW OFTEN THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS WHITISH OR GRAYISH IN LOOKING UP THE SUBJECT MYSELF I HAVE READ ONLY
0511-131228-0024 GREEN SCIENCE GOSSIP
0511-131228-0025 IT WOULD SEEM ACCEPTABLE THAT IF MANY REPORTS OF WHITE BIRDS SHOULD OCCUR THE BIRDS ARE NOT BLACKBIRDS EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN WHITE BLACKBIRDS OR THAT IF OFTEN REPORTED
0511-131228-0026 GRAYISH OR WHITISH GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE IS NOT NOSTOC AND IS NOT SPAWN IF OCCURRING IN TIMES UNSEASONABLE FOR SPAWN THE KENTUCKY PHENOMENON
0511-131228-0027 AND NOW WE HAVE AN OCCURRENCE THAT ATTRACTED A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION IN ITS OWN TIME USUALLY THESE THINGS OF THE ACCURSED HAVE BEEN HUSHED UP OR DISREGARDED SUPPRESSED LIKE THE SEVEN BLACK RAINS OF SLAINS BUT UPON MARCH THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX
0511-131228-0028 SOMETHING OCCURRED IN BATH COUNTY KENTUCKY THAT BROUGHT MANY NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENTS TO THE SCENE THE SUBSTANCE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEEF THAT FELL FROM THE SKY
0511-131228-0029 UPON MARCH THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AT OLYMPIAN SPRINGS BATH COUNTY KENTUCKY FLAKES OF A SUBSTANCE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEEF FELL FROM THE SKY FROM A CLEAR SKY WE'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT WAS SAID
0511-131228-0030 THAT NOTHING BUT THIS FALLING SUBSTANCE WAS VISIBLE IN THE SKY IT FELL IN FLAKES OF VARIOUS SIZES SOME TWO INCHES SQUARE
0511-131228-0031 THE FLAKE FORMATION IS INTERESTING LATER WE SHALL THINK OF IT AS SIGNIFYING PRESSURE SOMEWHERE IT WAS A THICK SHOWER ON THE GROUND ON TREES ON FENCES BUT IT WAS NARROWLY LOCALIZED
0511-131228-0032 AND THE NEW YORK TIMES MARCH TENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THEN THE EXCLUSIONISTS SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE BEEF ONE FLAKE OF IT THE SIZE OF A SQUARE ENVELOPE
0511-131228-0033 NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENTS WROTE BROADCAST AND WITNESSES WERE QUOTED AND THIS TIME THERE IS NO MENTION OF A HOAX AND EXCEPT BY ONE SCIENTIST
0511-131228-0034 THAT THE FALL DID TAKE PLACE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE EXCLUSIONISTS ARE STILL MORE EMPHATICALLY CONSERVATORS IT IS NOT SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE INIMICAL TO ALL DATA
0511-131228-0035 OF EXTERNALLY DERIVED SUBSTANCES THAT FALL UPON THIS EARTH AS THAT THEY ARE INIMICAL TO ALL DATA DISCORDANT WITH A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE SUCH PHENOMENA
0511-131228-0036 OR THE SPIRIT OR HOPE OR AMBITION OF THE COSMOS WHICH WE CALL ATTEMPTED POSITIVISM NOT TO FIND OUT THE NEW NOT TO ADD TO WHAT IS CALLED KNOWLEDGE BUT TO SYSTEMATIZE
0511-131228-0037 EXPRESSED IN THE SUPPLEMENT IS AMUSING TO SOME OF US WHO I FEAR MAY BE A LITTLE IMPROPER AT TIMES VERY SPIRIT OF THE SALVATION ARMY WHEN SOME THIRD RATE SCIENTIST COMES OUT WITH AN EXPLANATION OF THE VERMIFORM APPENDIX
0511-131228-0038 TO GIVE COMPLETENESS TO THE PROPER EXPLANATION IT IS SAID THAT MISTER BRANDEIS HAD IDENTIFIED THE SUBSTANCE AS FLESH COLORED NOSTOC PROFESSOR LAWRENCE SMITH OF KENTUCKY
0511-131228-0039 ONE OF THE MOST RESOLUTE OF THE EXCLUSIONISTS NEW YORK TIMES MARCH TWELFTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THAT THE SUBSTANCE HAD BEEN EXAMINED AND ANALYZED BY PROFESSOR SMITH ACCORDING TO WHOM IT GAVE EVERY INDICATION OF BEING THE
0511-131228-0040 DOCTOR A MEAD EDWARDS PRESIDENT OF THE NEWARK SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION
0511-131228-0041 HIS FEELING WAS OF CONVICTION THAT PROPRIETY HAD BEEN RE ESTABLISHED OR THAT THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN SOLVED AS HE EXPRESSES IT KNOWING MISTER BRANDEIS WELL HE HAD CALLED UPON THAT UPHOLDER OF RESPECTABILITY
0511-131228-0042 TO SEE THE SUBSTANCE THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NOSTOC BUT HE HAD ALSO CALLED UPON DOCTOR HAMILTON WHO HAD A SPECIMEN AND DOCTOR HAMILTON HAD DECLARED IT TO BE LUNG TISSUE DOCTOR EDWARDS
0511-131228-0043 WRITES OF THE SUBSTANCE THAT HAD SO COMPLETELY OR BEAUTIFULLY IF BEAUTY IS COMPLETENESS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NOSTOC IT TURNED OUT TO BE LUNG TISSUE ALSO
0511-131228-0045 THEY HAD DISGORGED PROFESSOR FASSIG LISTS THE SUBSTANCE IN HIS BIBLIOGRAPHY AS FISH SPAWN MC ATEE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN
0511-131228-0046 IF THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD SEEM TO COMBINE AGAINST YOU IT IS ONLY UNREAL COMBINATION OR INTERMEDIATENESS TO UNITY AND DISUNITY EVERY RESISTANCE IS ITSELF DIVIDED INTO PARTS RESISTING ONE ANOTHER THE SIMPLEST STRATEGY SEEMS TO BE
0511-131228-0047 NEVER BOTHER TO FIGHT A THING SET ITS OWN PARTS FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER WE ARE MERGING AWAY FROM CARNAL TO GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE AND HERE THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF INSTANCES OR REPORTS OF INSTANCES
0511-131228-0048 THESE DATA ARE SO IMPROPER THEY'RE OBSCENE TO THE SCIENCE OF TODAY BUT WE SHALL SEE THAT SCIENCE
0511-131228-0049 WAS NOT SO PRUDISH CHLADNI WAS NOT AND GREG WAS NOT I SHALL HAVE TO ACCEPT MYSELF THAT GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE HAS OFTEN FALLEN FROM THE SKY OR THAT
0511-131228-0050 FAR UP OR FAR AWAY THE WHOLE SKY IS GELATINOUS THAT METEORS TEAR THROUGH AND DETACH FRAGMENTS THAT FRAGMENTS ARE BROUGHT DOWN BY STORMS
0511-131228-0051 IT SEEMS MORE ACCEPTABLE THAT ONLY CERTAIN AREAS ARE
0511-131228-0052 SAYS THAT ALL OUR DATA IN THIS RESPECT MUST BE
0511-131228-0053 HE IS VERY SURE BUT JUST A LITTLE REDUNDANT WE SHALL BE OPPOSED BY THE STANDARD RESISTANCES THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE UP FROM ONE PLACE IN A WHIRLWIND AND DOWN IN ANOTHER
0511-131228-0054 WITH WHICH WE SHALL END UP IT WILL MEAN THAT SOMETHING HAD BEEN IN A STATIONARY POSITION FOR SEVERAL DAYS OVER A SMALL PART OF A SMALL TOWN IN ENGLAND THIS IS THE REVOLUTIONARY THING THAT WE HAVE ALLUDED TO BEFORE
0511-131228-0055 WHETHER THE SUBSTANCE WERE NOSTOC OR SPAWN OR SOME KIND OF A LARVAL NEXUS DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH IF IT STOOD IN THE SKY FOR SEVERAL DAYS WE RANK WITH MOSES AS A CHRONICLER OF IMPROPRIETIES
0511-131228-0056 TO ACCEPT CONNECTION OR THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST VAST GELATINOUS AREAS ALOFT AND THAT METEORITES TEAR THROUGH CARRYING DOWN SOME OF THE SUBSTANCE
0511-131228-0057 PLACED BEFORE THE ACADEMY SOME FRAGMENTS OF A GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE SAID TO HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY AND ASKED THAT THEY BE ANALYZED THERE IS NO FURTHER ALLUSION TO THIS SUBJECT COMPTES RENDUS
0511-131228-0058 THAT IN WILNA LITHUANIA APRIL FOURTH EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX IN A RAINSTORM FELL NUT SIZED MASSES OF A SUBSTANCE THAT IS DESCRIBED AS BOTH RESINOUS AND GELATINOUS IT WAS ODORLESS UNTIL BURNED
0511-131228-0059 THEN IT SPREAD A VERY PRONOUNCED SWEETISH ODOR IT IS DESCRIBED AS LIKE GELATINE BUT MUCH FIRMER BUT HAVING BEEN IN WATER TWENTY FOUR HOURS IT SWELLED OUT
0511-131228-0060 EARLY IN AUGUST EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR THOUSANDS OF JELLYFISH ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHILLING HAD FALLEN AT BATH ENGLAND I THINK IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT THEY WERE JELLYFISH BUT IT DOES LOOK
0511-131228-0061 AS IF THIS TIME FROG SPAWN DID FALL FROM THE SKY AND MAY HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED BY A WHIRLWIND BECAUSE
0511-131228-0062 SMALL FROGS FELL AT WIGAN ENGLAND NATURE EIGHTY SEVEN TEN THAT JUNE TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN ELEVEN AT ETON BUCKS ENGLAND THE GROUND WAS FOUND COVERED WITH MASSES OF JELLY THE SIZE OF PEAS

0511-131228-0064 OF BATH HIS DESCRIPTION IS OF MINUTE WORMS IN FILMY ENVELOPES HE TRIES TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR SEGREGATION THE MYSTERY OF IT IS WHAT COULD HAVE BROUGHT SO MANY OF THEM TOGETHER
0511-131228-0065 AND IN MOST OF THEM SEGREGATION IS THE GREAT MYSTERY A WHIRLWIND SEEMS ANYTHING BUT A SEGREGATIVE FORCE SEGREGATION OF THINGS THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY HAS BEEN AVOIDED AS MOST DEEP DYED OF THE DAMNED
0511-131228-0066 MISTER JENYNS CONCEIVES OF A LARGE POOL IN WHICH WERE MANY OF THESE SPHERICAL MASSES OF THE POOL DRYING UP AND CONCENTRATING ALL IN A SMALL AREA OF A WHIRLWIND THEN SCOOPING ALL UP TOGETHER
0511-131228-0067 IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE COMMON SENSE TO SAY THAT THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STATIONARY OVER THE TOWN OF BATH SEVERAL DAYS THE SEVEN BLACK RAINS OF SLAINS THE FOUR RED RAINS OF SIENA

0512-124520-0016 THERE WERE AS MANY DISTINCTIONS IN WRAPS AS IN MOTOR CARS THE LESSER SORT APPEARED IN YELLOW AND BLACK DOGSKIN COATS BUT KENNICOTT WAS LORDLY IN A LONG RACCOON ULSTER AND A NEW SEAL CAP WHEN THE SNOW WAS TOO DEEP FOR HIS MOTOR

0512-124520-0032 THE WORLD WAS SO LUMINOUS THAT SHE SAT DOWN AT HER RICKETY LITTLE DESK IN THE LIVING ROOM TO MAKE A POEM SHE GOT NO FARTHER THAN THE SKY IS BRIGHT THE SUN IS WARM THERE NE'ER WILL BE ANOTHER STORM
0512-124520-0033 IN THE MID AFTERNOON OF THIS SAME DAY KENNICOTT WAS CALLED INTO THE COUNTRY IT WAS BEA'S EVENING OUT HER EVENING FOR THE LUTHERAN DANCE CAROL WAS ALONE FROM THREE TILL MIDNIGHT
0512-124520-0034 THUS SHE CHANCED TO DISCOVER THAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO

0512-124520-0037 LAMB CHOPS WERE AS EXOTIC AS SHARKS FINS THE MEAT DEALERS SHIPPED THEIR BEST TO THE CITY WITH ITS HIGHER PRICES IN ALL THE SHOPS THERE WAS THE SAME LACK OF CHOICE SHE COULD NOT FIND A GLASS HEADED PICTURE NAIL IN TOWN
0512-124520-0038 SHE DID NOT HUNT FOR THE SORT OF VEILING SHE WANTED SHE TOOK WHAT SHE COULD GET AND ONLY AT HOWLAND AND GOULD'S WAS THERE SUCH A LUXURY AS CANNED ASPARAGUS ROUTINE CARE WAS ALL SHE COULD DEVOTE TO THE HOUSE
0512-124520-0039 ONLY BY SUCH FUSSING AS THE WIDOW BOGART'S COULD SHE MAKE IT FILL HER TIME SHE COULD NOT HAVE OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT TO THE VILLAGE DOCTOR'S WIFE IT WAS TABOO SHE WAS A WOMAN WITH A WORKING BRAIN AND NO WORK
0512-124520-0040 THERE WERE ONLY THREE THINGS WHICH SHE COULD DO HAVE CHILDREN START HER CAREER OF REFORMING OR BECOME SO DEFINITELY A PART OF THE TOWN THAT SHE WOULD BE FULFILLED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF CHURCH AND STUDY CLUB AND BRIDGE PARTIES
0512-124520-0041 CHILDREN YES SHE WANTED THEM BUT SHE WAS NOT QUITE READY SHE HAD BEEN EMBARRASSED BY KENNICOTT'S FRANKNESS BUT SHE AGREED WITH HIM THAT IN THE INSANE CONDITION OF CIVILIZATION
0512-124520-0042 WHICH MADE THE REARING OF CITIZENS MORE COSTLY AND PERILOUS THAN ANY OTHER CRIME IT WAS INADVISABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN TILL HE HAD MADE MORE MONEY SHE WAS SORRY PERHAPS HE HAD MADE ALL THE MYSTERY OF LOVE A MECHANICAL CAUTIOUSNESS BUT
0512-124520-0043 SHE FLED FROM THE THOUGHT WITH A DUBIOUS SOME DAY HER REFORMS HER IMPULSES TOWARD BEAUTY IN RAW MAIN STREET THEY HAD BECOME INDISTINCT BUT SHE WOULD SET THEM GOING NOW SHE WOULD

0512-124520-0045 SHE BEGAN TO THINK WITH UNPLEASANT LUCIDITY SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THE PEOPLE LIKED HER SHE HAD GONE TO THE WOMEN AT AFTERNOON COFFEES TO THE MERCHANTS IN THEIR STORES WITH SO MANY OUTPOURING COMMENTS AND WHIMSIES
0512-124520-0046 THAT SHE HADN'T GIVEN THEM A CHANCE TO BETRAY THEIR OPINIONS OF HER THE MEN SMILED BUT DID THEY LIKE HER SHE WAS LIVELY AMONG THE WOMEN BUT WAS SHE ONE OF THEM
0512-124549-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY SIX KENNICOTT WAS NOT SO INHUMANLY PATIENT THAT HE COULD CONTINUE TO FORGIVE CAROL'S HERESIES TO WOO HER AS HE HAD ON THE VENTURE TO CALIFORNIA SHE TRIED TO BE INCONSPICUOUS
0512-124549-0001 BUT SHE WAS BETRAYED BY HER FAILURE TO GLOW OVER THE BOOSTING KENNICOTT BELIEVED IN IT DEMANDED THAT SHE SAY PATRIOTIC THINGS ABOUT THE WHITE WAY AND THE NEW FACTORY HE SNORTED BY GOLLY I'VE DONE ALL I COULD
0512-124549-0002 AND NOW I EXPECT YOU TO PLAY THE GAME
0512-124549-0003 WHY YOU SAY HE'S A ROUGHNECK AND YOU WON'T JUMP ON THE BAND WAGON ONCE WHEN KENNICOTT ANNOUNCED AT NOON DINNER

0512-124549-0006 IN THE EARLY AUTUMN NEWS CAME FROM WAKAMIN THAT THE SHERIFF HAD FORBIDDEN AN ORGANIZER FOR THE NATIONAL NONPARTISAN LEAGUE TO SPEAK ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTY THE ORGANIZER HAD DEFIED THE SHERIFF

0512-124549-0044 HER DISCOVERY THAT SHE REALLY COULD GET AWAY FROM MAIN STREET WAS AS SWEET AS THE DISCOVERY OF LOVE KENNICOTT NEVER CONSENTED DEFINITELY AT MOST HE AGREED TO A PUBLIC THEORY THAT SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE A SHORT TRIP
0512-124549-0045 AND SEE WHAT THE EAST WAS LIKE IN WARTIME SHE SET OUT FOR WASHINGTON IN OCTOBER JUST BEFORE THE WAR ENDED SHE HAD DETERMINED ON WASHINGTON BECAUSE IT WAS LESS INTIMIDATING THAN THE OBVIOUS NEW YORK BECAUSE SHE HOPED TO FIND STREETS IN WHICH HUGH COULD PLAY
0512-124549-0046 AND BECAUSE IN THE STRESS OF WAR WORK WITH ITS DEMAND FOR THOUSANDS OF TEMPORARY CLERKS SHE COULD BE INITIATED INTO THE WORLD OF OFFICES HUGH WAS TO GO WITH HER DESPITE THE WAILS AND RATHER EXTENSIVE COMMENTS OF AUNT BESSIE
0512-124549-0047 SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT NOT ENCOUNTER ERIK IN THE EAST BUT IT WAS A CHANCE THOUGHT SOON FORGOTTEN
0512-124549-0048 THE LAST THING SHE SAW ON THE STATION PLATFORM WAS KENNICOTT FAITHFULLY WAVING HIS HAND HIS FACE SO FULL OF UNCOMPREHENDING LONELINESS THAT HE COULD NOT SMILE BUT ONLY TWITCH UP HIS LIPS SHE WAVED TO HIM AS LONG AS SHE COULD
0512-124549-0049 AND WHEN HE WAS LOST SHE WANTED TO LEAP FROM THE VESTIBULE AND RUN BACK TO HIM SHE THOUGHT OF A HUNDRED TENDERNESSES SHE HAD NEGLECTED SHE HAD HER FREEDOM AND IT WAS EMPTY THE MOMENT WAS NOT THE HIGHEST OF HER LIFE BUT THE LOWEST AND MOST DESOLATE
0512-124549-0050 WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER EXCELLENT FOR INSTEAD OF SLIPPING DOWNWARD SHE BEGAN TO CLIMB SHE SIGHED I COULDN'T DO THIS IF IT WEREN'T FOR WILL'S KINDNESS HIS GIVING ME MONEY BUT A SECOND AFTER
0512-124549-0051 I WONDER HOW MANY WOMEN WOULD ALWAYS STAY HOME IF THEY HAD THE MONEY HUGH COMPLAINED NOTICE ME MUMMY HE WAS BESIDE HER ON THE RED PLUSH SEAT OF THE DAY COACH A BOY OF THREE AND A HALF
0512-124549-0052 I'M TIRED OF PLAYING TRAIN LET'S PLAY SOMETHING ELSE LET'S GO SEE AUNTIE BOGART OH NO
0512-124549-0053 YES SHE GIVES ME COOKIES AND SHE TELLS ME ABOUT THE DEAR LORD YOU NEVER TELL ME ABOUT THE DEAR LORD WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE DEAR LORD AUNTIE BOGART SAYS I'M GOING TO BE A PREACHER CAN I BE A PREACHER CAN I PREACH ABOUT THE DEAR LORD
0512-124549-0054 OH PLEASE WAIT TILL MY GENERATION HAS STOPPED REBELLING BEFORE YOURS STARTS IN WHAT'S A GENERATION IT'S A RAY IN THE ILLUMINATION OF THE SPIRIT THAT'S FOOLISH
0512-124549-0055 HE WAS A SERIOUS AND LITERAL PERSON AND RATHER HUMORLESS SHE KISSED HIS FROWN AND MARVELED I AM RUNNING AWAY FROM MY HUSBAND AFTER LIKING A SWEDISH NE'ER DO WELL AND EXPRESSING IMMORAL OPINIONS JUST AS IN A ROMANTIC STORY
0512-124549-0056 AND MY OWN SON REPROVES ME BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GIVEN HIM RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION BUT THE STORY DOESN'T GO RIGHT I'M NEITHER GROANING NOR BEING DRAMATICALLY SAVED I KEEP ON RUNNING AWAY AND I ENJOY IT I'M MAD WITH JOY OVER IT
0512-124549-0057 GOPHER PRAIRIE IS LOST BACK THERE IN THE DUST AND STUBBLE AND I LOOK FORWARD SHE CONTINUED IT TO HUGH DARLING DO YOU KNOW WHAT MOTHER AND YOU ARE GOING TO FIND BEYOND THE BLUE HORIZON RIM WHAT
0512-124549-0058 FLATLY WE'RE GOING TO FIND ELEPHANTS WITH GOLDEN HOWDAHS FROM WHICH PEEP YOUNG MAHARANEES WITH NECKLACES OF RUBIES AND A DAWN SEA COLORED LIKE THE BREAST OF A DOVE
0512-124549-0059 AND A WHITE AND GREEN HOUSE FILLED WITH BOOKS AND SILVER TEA SETS AND COOKIES COOKIES OH MOST DECIDEDLY COOKIES WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF BREAD AND PORRIDGE
0512-124549-0060 BUT EVER SO MUCH SICKER ON NO COOKIES AT ALL THAT'S FOOLISH IT IS O MALE KENNICOTT HUH SAID KENNICOTT TWO AND WENT TO SLEEP ON HER SHOULDER
0512-124549-0061 MISSUS KENNICOTT CONFIDED TO YE SCRIBE THAT SHE WILL BE CONNECTED WITH ONE OF THE MULTIFARIOUS WAR ACTIVITIES NOW CENTERING IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL FOR A BRIEF PERIOD BEFORE RETURNING HER COUNTLESS FRIENDS WHO APPRECIATE HER SPLENDID LABORS WITH THE LOCAL RED CROSS
0512-124549-0062 REALIZE HOW VALUABLE SHE WILL BE TO ANY WAR BOARD WITH WHICH SHE CHOOSES TO BECOME CONNECTED GOPHER PRAIRIE THUS ADDS ANOTHER SHINING STAR TO ITS SERVICE FLAG AND WITHOUT WISHING TO KNOCK ANY NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES
0512-124549-0063 WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ANY TOWN OF ANYWHERES NEAR OUR SIZE IN THE STATE THAT HAS SUCH A STERLING WAR RECORD ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU'D BETTER WATCH GOPHER PRAIRIE GROW
0671-131030-0000 TUESDAY FEBRUARY NINETEENTH
0671-131030-0001 THE THIRD CHARGE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IS THAT IT WILL BE TAKEN FROM THAT CLASS OF CITIZENS WHICH WILL HAVE LEAST SYMPATHY WITH THE MASS OF THE PEOPLE AND BE MOST LIKELY TO AIM AT AN AMBITIOUS SACRIFICE OF THE MANY
0671-131030-0002 TO THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF THE FEW OF ALL THE OBJECTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN FRAMED AGAINST THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY WHILST THE OBJECTION ITSELF IS LEVELLED AGAINST A PRETENDED OLIGARCHY
0671-131030-0003 THE PRINCIPLE OF IT STRIKES AT THE VERY ROOT OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT THE AIM OF EVERY POLITICAL CONSTITUTION IS OR OUGHT TO BE FIRST TO OBTAIN FOR RULERS MEN WHO POSSESS MOST WISDOM TO DISCERN AND MOST VIRTUE TO PURSUE
0671-131030-0004 THE COMMON GOOD OF THE SOCIETY AND IN THE NEXT PLACE TO TAKE THE MOST EFFECTUAL PRECAUTIONS FOR KEEPING THEM VIRTUOUS WHILST THEY CONTINUE TO HOLD THEIR PUBLIC TRUST THE ELECTIVE MODE OF OBTAINING RULERS
0671-131030-0005 IS THE CHARACTERISTIC POLICY OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT THE MEANS RELIED ON IN THIS FORM OF GOVERNMENT FOR PREVENTING THEIR DEGENERACY ARE NUMEROUS AND VARIOUS THE MOST EFFECTUAL ONE
0671-131030-0006 IS SUCH A LIMITATION OF THE TERM OF APPOINTMENTS AS WILL MAINTAIN A PROPER RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PEOPLE LET ME NOW ASK WHAT CIRCUMSTANCE THERE IS IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
0671-131030-0007 THAT VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT OR FAVORS THE ELEVATION OF THE FEW ON THE RUINS OF THE MANY LET ME ASK WHETHER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IS NOT ON THE CONTRARY STRICTLY CONFORMABLE TO THESE PRINCIPLES
0671-131030-0008 AND SCRUPULOUSLY IMPARTIAL TO THE RIGHTS AND PRETENSIONS OF EVERY CLASS AND DESCRIPTION OF CITIZENS WHO ARE TO BE THE ELECTORS OF THE FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES NOT THE RICH MORE THAN THE POOR NOT THE LEARNED MORE THAN THE IGNORANT
0671-131030-0009 NOT THE HAUGHTY HEIRS OF DISTINGUISHED NAMES MORE THAN THE HUMBLE SONS OF OBSCURITY AND UNPROPITIOUS FORTUNE
0671-131030-0010 THEY ARE TO BE THE SAME WHO EXERCISE THE RIGHT IN EVERY STATE OF ELECTING THE CORRESPONDING BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE WHO ARE TO BE THE OBJECTS OF POPULAR CHOICE
0671-131030-0011 EVERY CITIZEN WHOSE MERIT MAY RECOMMEND HIM TO THE ESTEEM AND CONFIDENCE OF HIS COUNTRY NO QUALIFICATION OF WEALTH OF BIRTH OF RELIGIOUS FAITH OR OF CIVIL PROFESSION IS PERMITTED TO FETTER THE JUDGEMENT
0671-131030-0012 OR DISAPPOINT THE INCLINATION OF THE PEOPLE IF WE CONSIDER THE SITUATION OF THE MEN ON WHOM THE FREE SUFFRAGES OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS MAY CONFER THE REPRESENTATIVE TRUST
0671-131030-0013 WE SHALL FIND IT INVOLVING EVERY SECURITY WHICH CAN BE DEVISED OR DESIRED FOR THEIR FIDELITY TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS IN THE FIRST PLACE
0671-131030-0014 WE ARE TO PRESUME THAT IN GENERAL THEY WILL BE SOMEWHAT DISTINGUISHED ALSO BY THOSE QUALITIES WHICH ENTITLE THEM TO IT AND WHICH PROMISE A SINCERE AND SCRUPULOUS REGARD TO THE NATURE OF THEIR ENGAGEMENTS
0671-131030-0015 IN THE SECOND PLACE THEY WILL ENTER INTO THE PUBLIC SERVICE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH CANNOT FAIL TO PRODUCE A TEMPORARY AFFECTION AT LEAST TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS
0671-131030-0016 THERE IS IN EVERY BREAST A SENSIBILITY TO MARKS OF HONOR OF FAVOR OF ESTEEM AND OF CONFIDENCE WHICH APART FROM ALL CONSIDERATIONS OF INTEREST IS SOME PLEDGE FOR GRATEFUL AND BENEVOLENT RETURNS
0671-131030-0017 INGRATITUDE IS A COMMON TOPIC OF DECLAMATION AGAINST HUMAN NATURE AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT INSTANCES OF IT ARE BUT TOO FREQUENT AND FLAGRANT BOTH IN PUBLIC AND IN PRIVATE LIFE
0671-131030-0018 BUT THE UNIVERSAL AND EXTREME INDIGNATION WHICH IT INSPIRES IS ITSELF A PROOF OF THE ENERGY AND PREVALENCE OF THE CONTRARY SENTIMENT IN THE THIRD PLACE THOSE TIES WHICH BIND THE REPRESENTATIVE TO HIS CONSTITUENTS
0671-131030-0019 ARE STRENGTHENED BY MOTIVES OF A MORE SELFISH NATURE HIS PRIDE AND VANITY ATTACH HIM TO A FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH FAVORS HIS PRETENSIONS AND GIVES HIM A SHARE IN ITS HONORS AND DISTINCTIONS
0671-131030-0020 WHATEVER HOPES OR PROJECTS MIGHT BE ENTERTAINED BY A FEW ASPIRING CHARACTERS IT MUST GENERALLY HAPPEN THAT A GREAT PROPORTION OF THE MEN DERIVING THEIR ADVANCEMENT FROM THEIR INFLUENCE WITH THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE MORE TO HOPE FROM A PRESERVATION OF THE FAVOR
0671-131030-0021 THAN FROM INNOVATIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT SUBVERSIVE OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE PEOPLE ALL THESE SECURITIES HOWEVER WOULD BE FOUND VERY INSUFFICIENT WITHOUT THE RESTRAINT OF FREQUENT ELECTIONS HENCE IN THE FOURTH PLACE
0671-131030-0022 THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IS SO CONSTITUTED AS TO SUPPORT IN THE MEMBERS AN HABITUAL RECOLLECTION OF THEIR DEPENDENCE ON THE PEOPLE BEFORE THE SENTIMENTS IMPRESSED ON THEIR MINDS BY THE MODE OF THEIR ELEVATION CAN BE EFFACED BY THE EXERCISE OF POWER
0671-131030-0023 THEY WILL BE COMPELLED TO ANTICIPATE THE MOMENT WHEN THEIR POWER IS TO CEASE WHEN THEIR EXERCISE OF IT IS TO BE REVIEWED AND WHEN THEY MUST DESCEND TO THE LEVEL FROM WHICH THEY WERE RAISED THERE FOREVER TO REMAIN UNLESS A FAITHFUL DISCHARGE OF THEIR TRUST
0671-131030-0024 I WILL ADD
0671-131030-0025 RESTRAINING THEM FROM OPPRESSIVE MEASURES THAT THEY CAN MAKE NO LAW WHICH WILL NOT HAVE ITS FULL OPERATION ON THEMSELVES AND THEIR FRIENDS
0671-131030-0026 THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN DEEMED ONE OF THE STRONGEST BONDS BY WHICH HUMAN POLICY CAN CONNECT THE RULERS AND THE PEOPLE TOGETHER IT CREATES BETWEEN THEM THAT COMMUNION OF INTERESTS AND SYMPATHY OF SENTIMENTS OF WHICH FEW GOVERNMENTS HAVE FURNISHED EXAMPLES
0671-131030-0027 BUT WITHOUT WHICH EVERY GOVERNMENT DEGENERATES INTO TYRANNY IF IT BE ASKED WHAT IS TO RESTRAIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM MAKING LEGAL DISCRIMINATIONS IN FAVOR OF THEMSELVES AND A PARTICULAR CLASS OF THE SOCIETY I ANSWER
0671-131030-0028 THE GENIUS OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM THE NATURE OF JUST AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS AND ABOVE ALL THE VIGILANT AND MANLY SPIRIT WHICH ACTUATES THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA A SPIRIT WHICH NOURISHES FREEDOM AND IN RETURN IS NOURISHED BY IT
0671-131030-0029 IF THIS SPIRIT SHALL EVER BE SO FAR DEBASED AS TO TOLERATE A LAW NOT OBLIGATORY ON THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS ON THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE WILL BE PREPARED TO TOLERATE ANY THING BUT LIBERTY
0671-131030-0030 SUCH WILL BE THE RELATION BETWEEN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS DUTY GRATITUDE INTEREST AMBITION ITSELF ARE THE CHORDS BY WHICH THEY WILL BE BOUND TO FIDELITY AND SYMPATHY WITH THE GREAT MASS OF THE PEOPLE
0671-131030-0031 BUT ARE THEY NOT ALL THAT GOVERNMENT WILL ADMIT AND THAT HUMAN PRUDENCE CAN DEVISE ARE THEY NOT THE GENUINE AND THE CHARACTERISTIC MEANS BY WHICH REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT PROVIDES FOR THE LIBERTY AND HAPPINESS OF THE PEOPLE
0671-131030-0032 ARE THEY NOT THE IDENTICAL MEANS ON WHICH EVERY STATE GOVERNMENT IN THE UNION RELIES FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF THESE IMPORTANT ENDS WHAT THEN ARE WE TO UNDERSTAND BY THE OBJECTION WHICH THIS PAPER HAS COMBATED
0671-131030-0033 WHAT ARE WE TO SAY TO THE MEN WHO PROFESS THE MOST FLAMING ZEAL FOR REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT YET BOLDLY IMPEACH THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF IT WHO PRETEND TO BE CHAMPIONS FOR THE RIGHT AND THE CAPACITY OF THE PEOPLE TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN RULERS
0671-131030-0034 YET MAINTAIN THAT THEY WILL PREFER THOSE ONLY WHO WILL IMMEDIATELY AND INFALLIBLY BETRAY THE TRUST COMMITTED TO THEM WERE THE OBJECTION TO BE READ BY ONE WHO HAD NOT SEEN THE MODE PRESCRIBED BY THE CONSTITUTION FOR THE CHOICE OF REPRESENTATIVES
0671-131030-0035 HE COULD SUPPOSE NOTHING LESS THAN THAT SOME UNREASONABLE QUALIFICATION OF PROPERTY WAS ANNEXED TO THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE OR THAT THE RIGHT OF ELIGIBILITY WAS LIMITED TO PERSONS OF PARTICULAR FAMILIES OR FORTUNES
0671-131030-0036 OR AT LEAST THAT THE MODE PRESCRIBED BY THE STATE CONSTITUTIONS WAS IN SOME RESPECT OR OTHER VERY GROSSLY DEPARTED FROM WE HAVE SEEN HOW FAR SUCH A SUPPOSITION WOULD ERR
0671-131030-0037 NOR WOULD IT IN FACT BE LESS ERRONEOUS AS TO THE LAST THE ONLY DIFFERENCE DISCOVERABLE BETWEEN THE TWO CASES IS THAT EACH REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE ELECTED BY FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND CITIZENS WHILST IN THE INDIVIDUAL STATES
0671-131030-0038 THE ELECTION OF A REPRESENTATIVE IS LEFT TO ABOUT AS MANY HUNDREDS
0671-131030-0039 AND AN ABHORRENCE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF THIS BE THE POINT ON WHICH THE OBJECTION TURNS IT DESERVES TO BE EXAMINED IS IT SUPPORTED BY REASON THIS CANNOT BE SAID WITHOUT MAINTAINING THAT FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND CITIZENS
0671-131030-0040 ARE LESS CAPABLE OF CHOOSING A FIT REPRESENTATIVE OR MORE LIABLE TO BE CORRUPTED BY AN UNFIT ONE THAN FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED REASON ON THE CONTRARY ASSURES US THAT AS IN SO GREAT A NUMBER A FIT REPRESENTATIVE WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO BE FOUND
0671-131030-0041 SO THE CHOICE WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO BE DIVERTED FROM HIM
0671-131030-0042 IS THE CONSEQUENCE FROM THIS DOCTRINE ADMISSIBLE IF WE SAY THAT FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED CITIZENS ARE AS MANY AS CAN JOINTLY EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE MUST WE NOT DEPRIVE THE PEOPLE OF THE IMMEDIATE CHOICE OF THEIR PUBLIC SERVANTS
0671-131030-0043 IN EVERY INSTANCE WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE AS MANY OF THEM AS WILL AMOUNT TO ONE FOR THAT NUMBER OF CITIZENS IS THE DOCTRINE WARRANTED BY FACTS IT WAS SHOWN IN THE LAST PAPER
0671-131030-0044 THAT THE REAL REPRESENTATION IN THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS VERY LITTLE EXCEEDS THE PROPORTION OF ONE FOR EVERY THIRTY THOUSAND INHABITANTS BESIDES A VARIETY OF POWERFUL CAUSES NOT EXISTING HERE AND WHICH FAVOR IN THAT COUNTRY
0671-131030-0045 THE PRETENSIONS OF RANK AND WEALTH NO PERSON IS ELIGIBLE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A COUNTY UNLESS HE POSSESS REAL ESTATE OF THE CLEAR VALUE OF SIX HUNDRED POUNDS STERLING PER YEAR NOR OF A CITY OR BOROUGH UNLESS HE POSSESS A LIKE ESTATE
0671-131030-0046 OF HALF THAT ANNUAL VALUE TO THIS QUALIFICATION ON THE PART OF THE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES IS ADDED ANOTHER ON THE PART OF THE COUNTY ELECTORS WHICH RESTRAINS THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE TO PERSONS HAVING A FREEHOLD ESTATE OF THE ANNUAL VALUE
0671-131030-0047 OF MORE THAN TWENTY POUNDS STERLING ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT RATE OF MONEY NOTWITHSTANDING THESE UNFAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND NOTWITHSTANDING SOME VERY UNEQUAL LAWS IN THE BRITISH CODE
0671-131030-0048 IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION HAVE ELEVATED THE FEW ON THE RUINS OF THE MANY BUT WE NEED NOT RESORT TO FOREIGN EXPERIENCE ON THIS SUBJECT OUR OWN IS EXPLICIT AND DECISIVE
0671-131030-0049 THE DISTRICTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN WHICH THE SENATORS ARE CHOSEN IMMEDIATELY BY THE PEOPLE ARE NEARLY AS LARGE AS WILL BE NECESSARY FOR HER REPRESENTATIVES IN THE CONGRESS THOSE OF MASSACHUSETTS ARE LARGER THAN WILL BE NECESSARY FOR THAT PURPOSE
0671-131030-0050 AND THOSE OF NEW YORK STILL MORE SO IN THE LAST STATE THE MEMBERS OF ASSEMBLY FOR THE CITIES AND COUNTIES OF NEW YORK AND ALBANY ARE ELECTED BY VERY NEARLY AS MANY VOTERS AS WILL BE ENTITLED TO A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE CONGRESS
0671-131030-0051 CALCULATING ON THE NUMBER OF SIXTY FIVE REPRESENTATIVES ONLY IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE THAT IN THESE SENATORIAL DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES A NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES ARE VOTED FOR BY EACH ELECTOR AT THE SAME TIME
0671-131030-0052 IF THE SAME ELECTORS AT THE SAME TIME ARE CAPABLE OF CHOOSING FOUR OR FIVE REPRESENTATIVES THEY CANNOT BE INCAPABLE OF CHOOSING ONE PENNSYLVANIA IS AN ADDITIONAL EXAMPLE SOME OF HER COUNTIES WHICH ELECT HER STATE REPRESENTATIVES
0671-131030-0053 ARE ALMOST AS LARGE AS HER DISTRICTS WILL BE BY WHICH HER FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE ELECTED THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA IS SUPPOSED TO CONTAIN BETWEEN FIFTY AND SIXTY THOUSAND SOULS IT WILL THEREFORE FORM NEARLY TWO DISTRICTS FOR THE CHOICE OF FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES
0671-131030-0054 IT FORMS HOWEVER BUT ONE COUNTY IN WHICH EVERY ELECTOR VOTES FOR EACH OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND WHAT MAY APPEAR TO BE STILL MORE DIRECTLY TO OUR PURPOSE THE WHOLE CITY ACTUALLY ELECTS A SINGLE MEMBER
0671-131030-0055 FOR THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL THIS IS THE CASE IN ALL THE OTHER COUNTIES OF THE STATE ARE NOT THESE FACTS THE MOST SATISFACTORY PROOFS OF THE FALLACY WHICH HAS BEEN EMPLOYED AGAINST THE BRANCH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER CONSIDERATION
0671-131030-0056 HAS IT APPEARED ON TRIAL THAT THE SENATORS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW YORK OR THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF PENNSYLVANIA OR THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY
0671-131030-0057 HAVE BETRAYED ANY PECULIAR DISPOSITION TO SACRIFICE THE MANY TO THE FEW OR ARE IN ANY RESPECT LESS WORTHY OF THEIR PLACES THAN THE REPRESENTATIVES AND MAGISTRATES APPOINTED IN OTHER STATES BY VERY SMALL DIVISIONS OF THE PEOPLE
0671-131030-0058 BUT THERE ARE CASES OF A STRONGER COMPLEXION THAN ANY WHICH I HAVE YET QUOTED ONE BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE OF CONNECTICUT IS SO CONSTITUTED THAT EACH MEMBER OF IT IS ELECTED BY THE WHOLE STATE
0671-131030-0059 SO IS THE GOVERNOR OF THAT STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND OF THIS STATE AND THE PRESIDENT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE I LEAVE EVERY MAN TO DECIDE WHETHER THE RESULT OF ANY ONE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS CAN BE SAID TO COUNTENANCE A SUSPICION
0671-131040-0000 THE CONSTITUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT OF THE PROPOSED GOVERNMENT CLAIMS NEXT OUR ATTENTION THERE IS HARDLY ANY PART OF THE SYSTEM WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN ATTENDED WITH GREATER DIFFICULTY IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF IT THAN THIS
0671-131040-0001 AND THERE IS PERHAPS NONE WHICH HAS BEEN INVEIGHED AGAINST WITH LESS CANDOR OR CRITICISED WITH LESS JUDGMENT HERE THE WRITERS AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN PAINS TO SIGNALIZE THEIR TALENT OF MISREPRESENTATION
0671-131040-0002 CALCULATING UPON THE AVERSION OF THE PEOPLE TO MONARCHY THEY HAVE ENDEAVORED TO ENLIST ALL THEIR JEALOUSIES AND APPREHENSIONS IN OPPOSITION TO THE INTENDED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES NOT MERELY AS THE EMBRYO
0671-131040-0004 THEY HAVE NOT SCRUPLED TO DRAW RESOURCES EVEN FROM THE REGIONS OF FICTION THE AUTHORITIES OF A MAGISTRATE IN FEW INSTANCES GREATER IN SOME INSTANCES LESS THAN THOSE OF A GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK
0671-131040-0005 HAVE BEEN MAGNIFIED INTO MORE THAN ROYAL PREROGATIVES HE HAS BEEN DECORATED WITH ATTRIBUTES SUPERIOR IN DIGNITY AND SPLENDOR TO THOSE OF A KING OF GREAT BRITAIN HE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO US WITH THE DIADEM SPARKLING ON HIS BROW
0671-131040-0006 AND THE IMPERIAL PURPLE FLOWING IN HIS TRAIN HE HAS BEEN SEATED ON A THRONE SURROUNDED WITH MINIONS AND MISTRESSES GIVING AUDIENCE TO THE ENVOYS OF FOREIGN POTENTATES IN ALL THE SUPERCILIOUS POMP OF MAJESTY
0671-131040-0007 THE IMAGES OF ASIATIC DESPOTISM AND VOLUPTUOUSNESS HAVE SCARCELY BEEN WANTING TO CROWN THE EXAGGERATED SCENE WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO TREMBLE AT THE TERRIFIC VISAGES OF MURDERING JANIZARIES
0671-131040-0008 AND TO BLUSH AT THE UNVEILED MYSTERIES OF A FUTURE SERAGLIO ATTEMPTS SO EXTRAVAGANT AS THESE TO DISFIGURE OR IT MIGHT RATHER BE SAID TO METAMORPHOSE THE OBJECT RENDER IT NECESSARY
0671-131040-0009 TO TAKE AN ACCURATE VIEW OF ITS REAL NATURE AND FORM IN ORDER AS WELL TO ASCERTAIN ITS TRUE ASPECT AND GENUINE APPEARANCE AS TO UNMASK THE DISINGENUITY AND EXPOSE THE FALLACY OF THE COUNTERFEIT RESEMBLANCES
0671-131040-0010 WHICH HAVE BEEN SO INSIDIOUSLY
0671-131040-0011 IN THE EXECUTION OF THIS TASK THERE IS NO MAN WHO WOULD NOT FIND IT AN ARDUOUS EFFORT EITHER TO BEHOLD WITH MODERATION OR TO TREAT WITH SERIOUSNESS THE DEVICES NOT LESS WEAK THAN WICKED
0671-131040-0012 WHICH HAVE BEEN CONTRIVED TO PERVERT THE PUBLIC OPINION IN RELATION TO THE SUBJECT THEY SO FAR EXCEED THE USUAL THOUGH UNJUSTIFIABLE LICENSES OF PARTY ARTIFICE
0671-131040-0013 THAT EVEN IN A DISPOSITION THE MOST CANDID AND TOLERANT THEY MUST FORCE THE SENTIMENTS WHICH FAVOR AN INDULGENT CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONDUCT OF POLITICAL ADVERSARIES TO GIVE PLACE TO A VOLUNTARY
0671-131040-0014 AND UNRESERVED INDIGNATION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO BESTOW THE IMPUTATION OF DELIBERATE IMPOSTURE AND DECEPTION UPON THE GROSS PRETENSE OF A SIMILITUDE BETWEEN A KING OF GREAT BRITAIN
0671-131040-0015 AND A MAGISTRATE OF THE CHARACTER MARKED OUT FOR THAT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IT IS STILL MORE IMPOSSIBLE
0671-131040-0016 WHICH HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED TO GIVE SUCCESS TO THE ATTEMPTED IMPOSITION IN ONE INSTANCE WHICH I CITE AS A SAMPLE OF THE GENERAL SPIRIT THE TEMERITY HAS PROCEEDED SO FAR AS TO ASCRIBE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
0671-131040-0017 A POWER WHICH BY THE INSTRUMENT REPORTED IS EXPRESSLY ALLOTTED TO THE EXECUTIVES OF THE INDIVIDUAL STATES I MEAN THE POWER OF FILLING CASUAL VACANCIES IN THE SENATE
0671-131040-0018 THIS BOLD EXPERIMENT UPON THE DISCERNMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN HAS BEEN HAZARDED BY A WRITER WHO WHATEVER MAY BE HIS REAL MERIT HAS HAD NO INCONSIDERABLE SHARE IN THE APPLAUSES OF HIS PARTY
0671-131040-0019 AND WHO UPON THIS FALSE AND UNFOUNDED SUGGESTION HAS BUILT A SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS EQUALLY FALSE AND UNFOUNDED LET HIM NOW BE CONFRONTED WITH THE EVIDENCE OF THE FACT AND LET HIM IF HE BE ABLE
0671-131040-0020 JUSTIFY OR EXTENUATE THE SHAMEFUL OUTRAGE HE HAS OFFERED TO THE DICTATES OF TRUTH AND TO THE RULES OF FAIR DEALING THE SECOND CLAUSE OF THE SECOND SECTION OF THE SECOND ARTICLE
0671-131040-0021 EMPOWERS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO NOMINATE AND BY AND WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE SENATE TO APPOINT AMBASSADORS OTHER PUBLIC MINISTERS AND CONSULS JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT
0671-131040-0022 AND ALL OTHER OFFICERS OF UNITED STATES WHOSE APPOINTMENTS ARE NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR AND WHICH SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY LAW IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS CLAUSE FOLLOWS ANOTHER IN THESE WORDS
0671-131040-0023 THE PRESIDENT SHALL HAVE POWER TO FILL UP ALL VACANCIES THAT MAY HAPPEN DURING THE RECESS OF THE SENATE BY GRANTING COMMISSIONS WHICH SHALL EXPIRE AT THE END OF THEIR NEXT SESSION IT IS FROM THIS LAST PROVISION
0671-131040-0024 THAT THE PRETENDED POWER OF THE PRESIDENT TO FILL VACANCIES IN THE SENATE HAS BEEN DEDUCED A SLIGHT ATTENTION TO THE CONNECTION OF THE CLAUSES AND TO THE OBVIOUS MEANING OF THE TERMS WILL SATISFY US THAT THE DEDUCTION IS NOT EVEN COLORABLE
0671-131040-0025 THE FIRST OF THESE TWO CLAUSES IT IS CLEAR ONLY PROVIDES A MODE FOR APPOINTING SUCH OFFICERS WHOSE APPOINTMENTS ARE NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR IN THE CONSTITUTION AND WHICH SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY LAW
0671-131040-0026 OF COURSE IT CANNOT EXTEND TO THE APPOINTMENTS OF SENATORS WHOSE APPOINTMENTS ARE OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR IN THE CONSTITUTION
0671-131040-0027 AND WHO ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WILL NOT REQUIRE A FUTURE ESTABLISHMENT BY LAW THIS POSITION WILL HARDLY BE CONTESTED THE LAST OF THESE TWO CLAUSES IT IS EQUALLY CLEAR
0671-131040-0028 CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD TO COMPREHEND THE POWER OF FILLING VACANCIES IN THE SENATE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS FIRST THE RELATION IN WHICH THAT CLAUSE STANDS TO THE OTHER
0671-131040-0029 WHICH DECLARES THE GENERAL MODE OF APPOINTING OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES DENOTES IT TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN A SUPPLEMENT TO THE OTHER FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING AN AUXILIARY METHOD OF APPOINTMENT
0671-131040-0030 IN CASES TO WHICH THE GENERAL METHOD WAS INADEQUATE THE ORDINARY POWER OF APPOINTMENT IS CONFINED TO THE PRESIDENT AND SENATE JOINTLY AND CAN THEREFORE ONLY BE EXERCISED DURING THE SESSION OF THE SENATE BUT
0671-131040-0031 AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPROPER TO OBLIGE THIS BODY TO BE CONTINUALLY IN SESSION FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF OFFICERS AND AS VACANCIES MIGHT HAPPEN IN THEIR RECESS WHICH IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE TO FILL WITHOUT DELAY
0671-131040-0032 THE SUCCEEDING CLAUSE IS EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO AUTHORIZE THE PRESIDENT SINGLY TO MAKE TEMPORARY APPOINTMENTS DURING THE RECESS OF THE SENATE BY GRANTING COMMISSIONS WHICH SHALL EXPIRE AT THE END OF THEIR NEXT SESSION SECOND
0671-131040-0033 IF THIS CLAUSE IS TO BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE ONE WHICH PRECEDES THE VACANCIES OF WHICH IT SPEAKS MUST BE CONSTRUED TO RELATE TO THE OFFICERS DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING ONE AND THIS WE HAVE SEEN EXCLUDES FROM ITS DESCRIPTION
0671-131040-0034 THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE THIRD THE TIME WITHIN WHICH THE POWER IS TO OPERATE DURING THE RECESS OF THE SENATE AND THE DURATION OF THE APPOINTMENTS TO THE END OF THE NEXT SESSION OF THAT BODY
0671-131040-0035 CONSPIRE TO ELUCIDATE THE SENSE OF THE PROVISION WHICH IF IT HAD BEEN INTENDED TO COMPREHEND SENATORS WOULD NATURALLY HAVE REFERRED THE TEMPORARY POWER OF FILLING VACANCIES TO THE RECESS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURES
0671-131040-0036 WHO ARE TO MAKE THE PERMANENT APPOINTMENTS AND NOT TO THE RECESS OF THE NATIONAL SENATE WHO ARE TO HAVE NO CONCERN IN THOSE APPOINTMENTS AND WOULD HAVE EXTENDED THE DURATION IN OFFICE OF THE TEMPORARY SENATORS TO THE NEXT SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE
0671-131040-0037 IN WHOSE REPRESENTATION THE VACANCIES HAD HAPPENED INSTEAD OF MAKING IT TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE ENSUING SESSION OF THE NATIONAL SENATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BODY AUTHORIZED TO MAKE THE PERMANENT APPOINTMENTS
0671-131040-0038 WOULD OF COURSE HAVE GOVERNED THE MODIFICATION OF A POWER WHICH RELATED TO THE TEMPORARY APPOINTMENTS AND AS THE NATIONAL SENATE IS THE BODY WHOSE SITUATION IS ALONE CONTEMPLATED IN THE CLAUSE UPON WHICH THE SUGGESTION UNDER EXAMINATION HAS BEEN FOUNDED
0671-131040-0039 CAN ONLY BE DEEMED TO RESPECT THOSE OFFICERS IN WHOSE APPOINTMENT THAT BODY HAS A CONCURRENT AGENCY WITH THE PRESIDENT BUT LAST THE FIRST AND SECOND CLAUSES OF THE THIRD SECTION OF THE FIRST ARTICLE
0671-131040-0040 NOT ONLY OBVIATE ALL POSSIBILITY OF DOUBT BUT DESTROY THE PRETEXT OF MISCONCEPTION THE FORMER PROVIDES THAT THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES SHALL BE COMPOSED OF TWO SENATORS FROM EACH STATE
0671-131040-0041 CHOSEN BY THE LEGISLATURE THEREOF FOR SIX YEARS AND THE LATTER DIRECTS THAT IF VACANCIES IN THAT BODY SHOULD HAPPEN BY RESIGNATION OR OTHERWISE DURING THE RECESS OF THE LEGISLATURE OF ANY STATE
0671-131040-0042 THE EXECUTIVE THEREOF MAY MAKE TEMPORARY APPOINTMENTS UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING OF THE LEGISLATURE WHICH SHALL THEN FILL SUCH VACANCIES HERE IS AN EXPRESS POWER GIVEN IN CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS TERMS TO THE STATE EXECUTIVES
0671-131040-0043 TO FILL CASUAL VACANCIES IN THE SENATE BY TEMPORARY APPOINTMENTS WHICH NOT ONLY INVALIDATES THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE CLAUSE BEFORE CONSIDERED COULD HAVE BEEN INTENDED TO CONFER THAT POWER UPON THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BUT PROVES THAT THIS SUPPOSITION
0671-131040-0044 MUST HAVE ORIGINATED IN AN INTENTION TO DECEIVE THE PEOPLE TOO PALPABLE TO BE OBSCURED BY SOPHISTRY TOO ATROCIOUS TO BE PALLIATED BY HYPOCRISY I HAVE TAKEN THE PAINS TO SELECT THIS INSTANCE OF MISREPRESENTATION

0671-131040-0046 IN SO FLAGRANT A CASE TO ALLOW MYSELF A SEVERITY OF ANIMADVERSION LITTLE CONGENIAL WITH THE GENERAL SPIRIT OF THESE PAPERS I HESITATE NOT TO SUBMIT IT TO THE DECISION OF ANY CANDID AND HONEST ADVERSARY

0688-1070-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR THE ODDS AND ENDS OF DOCTOR WALKER'S SENSATIONAL ESCAPE THAT NIGHT TO SOUTH AMERICA OF THE RECOVERY OF OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND SECURITIES IN THE SAFE FROM THE CHIMNEY ROOM
0688-1070-0001 THE PAPERS HAVE KEPT THE PUBLIC WELL INFORMED OF MY SHARE IN DISCOVERING THE SECRET CHAMBER THEY HAVE BEEN SINGULARLY SILENT THE INNER HISTORY HAS NEVER BEEN TOLD MISTER JAMIESON GOT ALL KINDS OF CREDIT AND SOME OF IT HE DESERVED
0688-1070-0002 AND BY NIGHT SHE WAS AT SUNNYSIDE UNDER GERTRUDE'S PARTICULAR CARE WHILE HER MOTHER HAD GONE TO BARBARA FITZHUGH'S WHAT HALSEY SAID TO MISSUS ARMSTRONG I NEVER KNEW BUT THAT HE WAS CONSIDERATE AND CHIVALROUS I FEEL CONFIDENT IT WAS HALSEY'S WAY ALWAYS WITH WOMEN
0688-1070-0003 HE AND LOUISE HAD NO CONVERSATION TOGETHER UNTIL THAT NIGHT GERTRUDE AND ALEX I MEAN JACK HAD GONE FOR A WALK ALTHOUGH IT WAS NINE O'CLOCK AND ANYBODY BUT A PAIR OF YOUNG GEESE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT DEW WAS FALLING AND THAT IT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO GET RID OF A SUMMER COLD
0688-1070-0004 AT HALF AFTER NINE GROWING WEARY OF MY OWN COMPANY I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO FIND THE YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE DOOR OF THE LIVING ROOM I PAUSED GERTRUDE AND JACK HAD RETURNED AND WERE THERE SITTING TOGETHER ON A DIVAN WITH ONLY ONE LAMP LIGHTED THEY DID NOT SEE OR HEAR ME
0688-1070-0005 AND I BEAT A HASTY RETREAT TO THE LIBRARY BUT HERE AGAIN I WAS DRIVEN BACK LOUISE WAS SITTING IN A DEEP CHAIR LOOKING THE HAPPIEST I HAD EVER SEEN HER WITH HALSEY ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR HOLDING HER CLOSE IT WAS NO PLACE FOR AN ELDERLY SPINSTER
0688-1070-0006 I RETIRED TO MY UPSTAIRS SITTING ROOM AND GOT OUT ELIZA KLINEFELTER'S LAVENDER SLIPPERS AH WELL THE FOSTER MOTHERHOOD WOULD SOON HAVE TO BE PUT AWAY IN CAMPHOR AGAIN THE NEXT DAY BY DEGREES I GOT THE WHOLE STORY
0688-1070-0007 PAUL ARMSTRONG HAD A BESETTING EVIL THE LOVE OF MONEY COMMON ENOUGH BUT HE LOVED MONEY NOT FOR WHAT IT WOULD BUY BUT FOR ITS OWN SAKE AN EXAMINATION OF THE BOOKS SHOWED NO IRREGULARITIES IN THE PAST YEAR SINCE JOHN HAD BEEN CASHIER
0688-1070-0008 BUT BEFORE THAT IN THE TIME OF ANDERSON THE OLD CASHIER WHO HAD DIED MUCH STRANGE JUGGLING HAD BEEN DONE WITH THE RECORDS THE RAILROAD IN NEW MEXICO HAD APPARENTLY DRAINED THE BANKER'S PRIVATE FORTUNE AND HE DETERMINED TO RETRIEVE IT BY ONE STROKE
0688-1070-0009 THIS WAS NOTHING LESS THAN THE LOOTING OF THE BANK'S SECURITIES TURNING THEM INTO MONEY AND MAKING HIS ESCAPE BUT THE LAW HAS LONG ARMS PAUL ARMSTRONG EVIDENTLY STUDIED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY JUST AS THE ONLY GOOD INDIAN IS A DEAD INDIAN
0688-1070-0010 THE CONNIVANCE OF DOCTOR WALKER WAS SUGGESTED BY HIS LOVE FOR LOUISE THE MAN WAS UNSCRUPULOUS AND WITH THE GIRL AS A BAIT PAUL ARMSTRONG SOON HAD HIM FAST THE PLAN WAS APPARENTLY THE ACME OF SIMPLICITY A SMALL TOWN IN THE WEST
0688-1070-0011 AN ATTACK OF HEART DISEASE A BODY FROM A MEDICAL COLLEGE DISSECTING ROOM SHIPPED IN A TRUNK TO DOCTOR WALKER BY A COLLEAGUE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND PALMED OFF FOR THE SUPPOSED DEAD BANKER WHAT WAS SIMPLER THE WOMAN NINA CARRINGTON WAS THE COG THAT SLIPPED
0688-1070-0012 WHAT SHE ONLY SUSPECTED WHAT SHE REALLY KNEW WE NEVER LEARNED SHE WAS A CHAMBERMAID IN THE HOTEL AT C AND IT WAS EVIDENTLY HER INTENTION TO BLACKMAIL DOCTOR WALKER HIS POSITION AT THAT TIME WAS UNCOMFORTABLE
0688-1070-0013 HE DENIED THE WHOLE THING AND SHE WENT TO HALSEY IT WAS THIS THAT HAD TAKEN HALSEY TO THE DOCTOR THE NIGHT HE DISAPPEARED HE ACCUSED THE DOCTOR OF THE DECEPTION AND CROSSING THE LAWN HAD SAID SOMETHING CRUEL TO LOUISE THEN FURIOUS AT HER APPARENT CONNIVANCE
0688-1070-0014 HE HAD STARTED FOR THE STATION DOCTOR WALKER AND PAUL ARMSTRONG THE LATTER STILL LAME WHERE I HAD SHOT HIM HURRIED ACROSS TO THE EMBANKMENT CERTAIN ONLY OF ONE THING HALSEY MUST NOT TELL THE DETECTIVE WHAT HE SUSPECTED
0688-1070-0015 UNTIL THE MONEY HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE CHIMNEY ROOM THEY STEPPED INTO THE ROAD IN FRONT OF THE CAR TO STOP IT AND FATE PLAYED INTO THEIR HANDS THE CAR STRUCK THE TRAIN AND THEY HAD ONLY TO DISPOSE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS FIGURE IN THE ROAD THIS THEY DID AS I HAVE TOLD
0688-1070-0016 SUNNYSIDE WITH ITS HOARD IN THE CHIMNEY ROOM HAD BEEN RENTED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE ATTEMPTS TO DISLODGE ME HAVING FAILED HE WAS DRIVEN TO BREAKING INTO HIS OWN HOUSE THE LADDER IN THE CHUTE THE BURNING OF THE STABLE AND THE ENTRANCE THROUGH THE CARD ROOM WINDOW
0688-1070-0017 ALL WERE IN THE COURSE OF A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO GET INTO THE CHIMNEY ROOM LOUISE AND HER MOTHER HAD FROM THE FIRST BEEN THE GREAT STUMBLING BLOCKS THE PLAN HAD BEEN TO SEND LOUISE AWAY UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE FOR HER TO INTERFERE BUT SHE CAME BACK TO THE HOTEL AT C
0688-1070-0018 JUST AT THE WRONG TIME THERE WAS A TERRIBLE SCENE THE GIRL WAS TOLD THAT SOMETHING OF THE KIND WAS NECESSARY THAT THE BANK WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE AND HER STEPFATHER WOULD EITHER AVOID ARREST AND DISGRACE IN THIS WAY OR KILL HIMSELF FANNY ARMSTRONG WAS A WEAKLING
0688-1070-0019 SHE HAD NO LOVE FOR HER STEPFATHER BUT HER DEVOTION TO HER MOTHER WAS ENTIRE SELF SACRIFICING FORCED INTO ACQUIESCENCE BY HER MOTHER'S APPEALS OVERWHELMED BY THE SITUATION THE GIRL CONSENTED AND FLED
0688-1070-0020 HAD SENT THE CASHIER TO THE BANK THAT NIGHT IN A FRENZY LOUISE ARRIVED AT SUNNYSIDE AND FOUND THE HOUSE RENTED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO SHE SENT FOR ARNOLD AT THE GREENWOOD CLUB AND TOLD HIM A LITTLE NOT ALL
0688-1070-0021 SHE TOLD HIM THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG AND THAT THE BANK WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE THAT HIS FATHER WAS RESPONSIBLE OF THE CONSPIRACY SHE SAID NOTHING TO HER SURPRISE ARNOLD ALREADY KNEW THROUGH BAILEY THAT NIGHT THAT THINGS WERE NOT RIGHT
0688-1070-0022 MOREOVER HE SUSPECTED WHAT LOUISE DID NOT THAT THE MONEY WAS HIDDEN AT SUNNYSIDE HE HAD A SCRAP OF PAPER THAT INDICATED A CONCEALED ROOM SOMEWHERE HIS INHERITED CUPIDITY WAS AROUSED EAGER TO GET HALSEY AND JACK BAILEY OUT OF THE HOUSE
0688-1070-0023 HE WENT UP TO THE EAST ENTRY AND IN THE BILLIARD ROOM GAVE THE CASHIER WHAT HE HAD REFUSED EARLIER IN THE EVENING THE ADDRESS OF PAUL ARMSTRONG IN CALIFORNIA AND A TELEGRAM WHICH HAD BEEN FORWARDED TO THE CLUB FOR BAILEY FROM DOCTOR WALKER
0688-1070-0024 IT WAS IN RESPONSE TO ONE BAILEY HAD SENT AND IT SAID THAT PAUL ARMSTRONG WAS VERY ILL BAILEY WAS ALMOST DESPERATE HE DECIDED TO GO WEST AND FIND PAUL ARMSTRONG AND TO FORCE HIM TO DISGORGE
0688-1070-0025 BUT THE CATASTROPHE AT THE BANK OCCURRED SOONER THAN HE HAD EXPECTED ON THE MOMENT OF STARTING WEST AT ANDREWS STATION WHERE MISTER JAMIESON HAD LOCATED THE CAR HE READ THAT THE BANK HAD CLOSED AND GOING BACK SURRENDERED HIMSELF
0688-1070-0026 JOHN BAILEY HAD KNOWN PAUL ARMSTRONG INTIMATELY HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE MONEY WAS GONE IN FACT IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE IN THE INTERVAL SINCE THE SECURITIES HAD BEEN TAKEN WHERE WAS IT
0688-1070-0027 BAILEY FELT SURE THERE WAS A HIDDEN ROOM AT SUNNYSIDE HE TRIED TO SEE THE ARCHITECT OF THE BUILDING BUT LIKE THE CONTRACTOR
0688-1070-0028 IT WAS HALSEY'S IDEA THAT JOHN BAILEY COME TO THE HOUSE AS A GARDENER AND PURSUE HIS INVESTIGATIONS AS HE COULD HIS SMOOTH UPPER LIP HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT DISGUISE WITH HIS CHANGE OF CLOTHES AND A HAIR CUT BY A COUNTRY BARBER
0688-1070-0029 SO IT WAS ALEX JACK BAILEY WHO HAD BEEN OUR GHOST NOT ONLY HAD HE ALARMED LOUISE AND HIMSELF HE ADMITTED ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE BUT HE HAD DUG THE HOLE IN THE TRUNK ROOM WALL AND LATER SENT ELIZA INTO HYSTERIA
0688-1070-0030 THE NOTE LIDDY HAD FOUND IN GERTRUDE'S SCRAP BASKET WAS FROM HIM AND IT WAS HE WHO HAD STARTLED ME INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS BY THE CLOTHES CHUTE AND WITH GERTRUDE'S HELP HAD CARRIED ME TO LOUISE'S ROOM GERTRUDE I LEARNED HAD WATCHED ALL NIGHT BESIDE ME
0688-1070-0031 IN AN EXTREMITY OF ANXIETY ABOUT ME THAT OLD THOMAS HAD SEEN HIS MASTER AND THOUGHT HE HAD SEEN THE SUNNYSIDE GHOST THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT
0688-1070-0032 THE NIGHT LIDDY AND I HEARD THE NOISE ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE THAT TOO WAS RIGHT ON THE NIGHT BEFORE ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WAS MURDERED JACK BAILEY HAD MADE HIS FIRST ATTEMPT TO SEARCH FOR THE SECRET ROOM
0688-1070-0033 AND HE TOOK THE OWL TRAIN TO TOWN THE ODDEST THING TO ME WAS THAT MISTER JAMIESON HAD KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT ALEX WAS JACK BAILEY BUT THE FACE OF THE PSEUDO GARDENER WAS VERY QUEER INDEED WHEN THAT NIGHT IN THE CARD ROOM THE DETECTIVE TURNED TO HIM AND SAID
0688-1070-0034 SUNNYSIDE IS FOR SALE NO I SHALL NOT BUY IT LITTLE LUCIEN ARMSTRONG IS LIVING WITH HIS STEP GRANDMOTHER AND SHE IS RECOVERING GRADUALLY FROM TROUBLES THAT HAD EXTENDED OVER THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF HER SECOND MARRIAGE
0688-1070-0035 ANNE WATSON LIES NOT FAR FROM THE MAN SHE KILLED AND WHO AS SURELY CAUSED HER DEATH THOMAS THE FOURTH VICTIM OF THE CONSPIRACY IS BURIED ON THE HILL WITH NINA CARRINGTON FIVE LIVES WERE SACRIFICED IN THE COURSE OF THIS GRIM CONSPIRACY
0688-1070-0036 THERE WILL BE TWO WEDDINGS BEFORE LONG AND LIDDY HAS ASKED FOR MY HELIOTROPE POPLIN TO WEAR TO THE CHURCH I KNEW SHE WOULD SHE HAS WANTED IT FOR THREE YEARS AND SHE WAS QUITE UGLY THE TIME I SPILLED COFFEE ON IT WE ARE VERY QUIET JUST THE TWO OF US
0688-1070-0037 WHEN WARNER MARRIED ROSIE LIDDY SNIFFED AND SAID WHAT I TOOK FOR FAITHFULNESS IN ROSIE HAD BEEN NOTHING BUT MAWKISHNESS I HAVE NOT YET OUTLIVED LIDDY'S CONTEMPT BECAUSE I GAVE THEM SILVER KNIVES AND FORKS AS A WEDDING GIFT
0688-1070-0038 SO WE SIT AND TALK AND SOMETIMES LIDDY THREATENS TO LEAVE AND OFTEN I DISCHARGE HER BUT WE STAY TOGETHER SOMEHOW I AM TALKING OF RENTING A HOUSE NEXT YEAR AND LIDDY SAYS TO BE SURE THERE IS NO GHOST

0688-46588-0000 ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID ON GETTING SETTLED ON MY RANCH THE SECOND TIME I WAS IN CALIFORNIA WAS TO GET A WAGON AND GO DOWN TO MY EUCALYPTUS GROVE FOR A LOAD OF THE PALE GREEN AROMATIC BOUGHS WITH WHICH TO TRIM MY ATTIC STUDY FOR THEIR FRAGRANCE IS DELIGHTFUL
0688-46588-0001 AND THEIR DELICATE BLUE GREEN TONE LENDS ITSELF READILY TO DECORATIVE PURPOSES WHEN THE SUPPLY NEEDED REPLENISHING I RODE DOWN ON MOUNTAIN BILLY AND CARRIED HOME THE SWEET SMELLING BRANCHES ON THE SADDLE THE GROVE SERVED A MORE UTILITARIAN PURPOSE HOWEVER
0688-46588-0002 THE EUCALYPTUS IS AN AUSTRALIAN TREE WITH NARROW STRAIGHT HANGING LEAVES AND ITS RAPID GROWTH MAKES IT USEFUL FOR FIREWOOD A TREE WILL GROW FORTY FEET IN FOUR YEARS
0688-46588-0003 AND ITS GREENNESS WAS MOST GRATEFUL TO EYES UNUSED TO THE BRIGHT COLORS AND STRONG LIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA OPPOSITE THE LITTLE GROVE IN A SMALL HOUSE PERCHED ON A HILL AN OLD SEA CAPTAIN LIVED ALONE
0688-46588-0004 AS I RODE BY ONE DAY HE SAT WITH HIS FEET HANGING OVER THE EDGE OF THE HIGH PIAZZA LOOKING OFF AS IF ON THE PROW OF HIS VESSEL GAZING OUT TO SEA WHEN I STOPPED TO ASK IF HE HAD SEEN ANYTHING NOTEWORTHY HAPPEN AT THE GROVE
0688-46588-0005 HE HAD SPOKEN IN AN IMPERSONAL WAY THAT I QUITE UNDERSTOOD HE HAD BEEN TAKEN UNAWARES BUT THE NEXT TIME I RODE PAST AS IF TO MAKE UP FOR ANY APPARENT RUDENESS HE CAME HURRYING DOWN THE WALK TO TELL ME OF A CROW'S NEST HE HAD SEEN IN THE GROVE
0688-46588-0006 TO MARK IT HE HAD FASTENED A PIECE OF PAPER TO THE WIRE FENCE BY THE ROAD AND ANOTHER PAPER TO THE NEST TREE BINDING IT ON WITH A EUCALYPTUS TWIG IN TRUE SAILOR FASHION IT WAS ALWAYS A RELIEF TO LEAVE THE HOT BEATING SUN AND THE GLARE OF THE YELLOW FIELDS
0688-46588-0007 AND ENTER THE COOL SHADE OF THE QUIET GROVE I COULD LET DOWN THE FENCE AND PUT IT UP BEHIND ME THUS HAVING MY SMALL FOREST ALL TO MYSELF AND USED TO ENJOY RIDING UP AND DOWN THE FRAGRANT BLUE AVENUES THE EUCALYPTUS TREES ALTHOUGH THIRTY OR FORTY FEET HIGH
0688-46588-0008 WERE LITHE AND SLENDER SOME OF THEM COULD BE SPANNED BY THE HANDS THE ROWS WERE PLANTED TEN FEET APART BUT THE LONG BRANCHES INTERLACED SO ONE HAD TO BE ON THE ALERT IN RIDING DOWN THE LINES TO BEND LOW ON THE SADDLE OR PUSH ASIDE THE BRANCHES THAT OBSTRUCTED THE WAY
0688-46588-0009 THE LIMBS WERE SO SLENDER AND FLEXIBLE THAT A TOUCH WAS ENOUGH TO BEND BACK A GREEN GATE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FEET LONG AND BILLY OFTEN PUSHED A BRANCH ASIDE WITH HIS NOSE IN PLACES FALLEN TREES BARRED OUR PATH BUT BILLY USED TO STEP CAREFULLY OVER THEM
0688-46588-0010 THE EUCALYPTUS TREES CHANGE VERY CURIOUSLY AS THEY GROW OLD WHEN YOUNG THEY ARE COVERED WITH BRANCHES LOW TO THE GROUND AND THEIR AROMATIC TENDER LEAVES ARE LIGHT BLUISH GREEN AFTERWARDS THEY LOSE THEIR LOWER BRANCHES WHILE THEIR LEAVES BECOME STIFF AND SICKLE SHAPED
0688-46588-0011 DULL GREEN AND ALMOST ODORLESS THE SAME CHANGES ARE SEEN IN THE BARK FIRST THE TRUNKS ARE SMOOTH AND GREEN THEN THEY ARE HUNG WITH SHAGGY SHREDS OF BARK THIS IN TURN DROPS OFF SO THAT THE OLD TREES ARE SMOOTH AGAIN
0688-46588-0012 BUT MY FIRST INTEREST WAS IN FINDING OUT WHO LIVED IN MY LITTLE WOODS A DOG HAD ONCE BEEN SEEN DRIVING A COYOTE WOLF OUT OF IT BUT THAT WAS MERELY IN PASSING I DID NOT EXPECT TO MEET WOLVES THERE IT WAS SAID HOWEVER TO BE A GOOD PLACE FOR TARANTULAS
0688-46588-0013 FOR THE EUCALYPTUS ABSORBED ALL THE MOISTURE AND THAT MAY HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH ITS FREEDOM FROM SNAKES AND SCORPIONS THOUGH IT WOULD NOT EXPLAIN THE ABSENCE OF CATERPILLARS AND SPIDERS WHICH JUST THEN WERE SO COMMON OUTSIDE THOUGH IN THE GROVE A GREAT DEAL
0688-46588-0014 I NEVER RAN INTO BUT ONE COBWEB AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE PLEASANT FREEDOM FROM FALLING CATERPILLARS MOREOVER I NEVER SAW A LIZARD IN THE BLUE GUMS THOUGH DOZENS OF THEM WERE TO BE SEEN ABOUT THE OAKS AND IN THE BRUSH IT WAS A SURPRISE TO FIND SO MANY FEATHERED FOLKS LIVING IN THE EUCALYPTUS
0688-46588-0015 AND I TOOK A PERSONAL INTEREST IN EACH ONE OF THE INHABITANTS THE FIRST TIME WE STARTED TO GO UP AND DOWN THE AVENUES WE SCARED UP A PAIR OF TURTLE DOVES BEAUTIFUL DELICATELY TINTED GENTLE CREATURES FIT TENANTS OF THE LOVELY GROVE
0688-46588-0016 IN SUCH A MARKED MANNER THAT WHEN WE PASSED A YOUNG DOVE A FEW YARDS FARTHER ON IT WAS EASY TO PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
0688-46588-0017 AND THE GROVE BECAME MUSICAL WITH THE SWEET CALLS OF THE YOUNG BROOD
0688-46588-0018 OR WHETHER THE BARK HAD FALLEN DOWN ON THEM AFTER THEY BUILT I COULD GET NO TRACE OF THE OWNERS OF THE NEST AND IT TROUBLED ME NOT LIKING TO HAVE ANY LITTLE HOMES IN MY WOOD THAT I DID NOT KNOW ALL ABOUT
0688-46588-0019 IN ONE OF THE TREES WE CAME TO AN ENORMOUS NEST MADE OF THE UNUSUAL MATERIALS THAT ARE SOMETIMES CHOSEN BY THAT STRANGE BIRD THE ROAD RUNNER IT WAS AN EXCITING DISCOVERY FOR THAT WAS BEFORE THE ROAD RUNNER HAD COME TO THE RANCH HOUSE
0688-46588-0020 AND I HAD BEEN PURSUING PHANTOM RUNNERS OVER THE HILLS IN THE VAIN ATTEMPT TO LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THEM WHILE HERE IT SEEMED ONE HAD BEEN LIVING UNDER MY VERY VINE AND FIG TREE TO MAKE SURE ABOUT THE NEST I SPOKE TO MY NEIGHBOR RANCHMAN
0688-46588-0021 AND HE TOLD ME THAT WHEN HE HAD BEEN MILKING DURING THE SPRING HE HAD OFTEN SEEN THE BIRDS COME OUT OF THE BLUE GUMS AND HAD ALSO SEEN THEM PERCHING THERE ON THE TREES HOW EXASPERATING IF I HAD ONLY COME EARLIER NOW THEY HAD GONE AND MY CHANCE OF A NEST STUDY WAS LOST
0688-46588-0022 BUT MY DOLL WAS NOT STUFFED WITH SAWDUST FOR ALL OF THAT THERE WAS STILL MUCH TO ENJOY FOR A MOURNING DOVE FLEW FROM HER NEST OF TWIGS ALMOST OVER BILLY'S HEAD AND IT MADE ME QUITE HAPPY TO KNOW THAT THE GENTLE BIRD WAS BROODING HER EGGS IN MY WOODS
0688-46588-0023 IT SEEMED ODD FOR THERE WAS HER LITTLE COUSIN NESTING OUT IN THE WEEDS IN THE BRIGHT SUN WHILE SHE WAS RAISING HER BROOD IN THE SHADY FOREST THE TWO NESTS WERE AS UNLIKE AS THE SITES THE BIRD OUTSIDE HAD USED DULL GREEN WEEDS WHILE THIS ONE USED BEAUTIFUL SHINING OAK STEMS
0688-46588-0024 I THOUGHT THE PRETTY BIRD WOULD SURELY BE SAFE HERE BUT ONE DAY WHEN I CALLED EXPECTING TO SEE A GROWING FAMILY I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND A PATHETIC LITTLE SKELETON IN THE NEST ONE AFTERNOON IN RIDING DOWN THE ROWS I CAME FACE TO FACE
0688-46588-0025 WITH TWO MITES OF HUMMINGBIRDS SEATED ON A BRANCH THEIR GRAYISH GREEN SUITS TONED IN WITH THE COLOR OF THE BLUE GUMS IT WAS A SURPRISE WHEN ONE OF THEM TURNED TO THE OTHER AND FED IT THE MOTHER HUMMER WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO BE TAKEN FOR A NESTLING
0688-46588-0026 HE SAT VERY UNCONCERNEDLY ON A LOW BRANCH RIGHT OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD BUT BILLY DID NOT RUN OVER HIM I FOUND TWO HUMMERS NESTS IN THE EUCALYPTUS DURING THE SUMMER ONE BUILDER WAS THE ONE THE PHOTOGRAPHER WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO CATCH BROODING
0688-46588-0027 MAKING IT THE HIGHEST HUMMINGBIRD'S NEST I HAD EVER SEEN IT WAS ATTACHED TO A RED LEAF TO MARK THE SPOT PERHAPS ONE OFTEN WONDERS HOW A BIRD CAN COME BACK TWICE TO THE SAME LEAF IN A FOREST HOW ONE LITTLE HOME DOES MAKE A PLACE HABITABLE
0688-46588-0028 FROM A BARE SILENT WOODS IT BECOMES A DWELLING PLACE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO CENTRE AROUND THIS LITTLE NEST THEN THE ONLY ONE IN THE GROVE THE TINY PINCH OF DOWN BECAME THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WOODS IT WAS THE CASTLE WHICH THE TREES SURROUNDED WHEN I FIRST FOUND THE NEST
0688-46588-0029 AND I BECAME MUCH INTERESTED IN WATCHING THEIR PROGRESS OFTEN RIDING DOWN TO SEE HOW THEY WERE GETTING ON THE HUMMER DID NOT RETURN MY INTEREST SHE WAS NERVOUS DARTING OFF WHEN BILLY SHOOK HIMSELF OR WHEN THE SHADOW OF A SOARING TURKEY BUZZARD FELL OVER THE NEST
0688-46588-0030 BUT IN SPITE OF THAT WE MADE OURSELVES QUITE AT HOME BEFORE HER DOOR I WOULD DISMOUNT AND SIT ON THE GROUND LEANING AGAINST A BLUE GUM WHILE BILLY STOOD BY IN A BOWER OF GREEN LEAVES WITH EARS PRICKED FORWARD THOUGHTFULLY AND A DREAMY LOOK OF SATISFACTION IN HIS EYES
0688-46588-0031 SOON SHE BEGAN TO ACT SO STRANGELY FOR A BROODING BIRD THAT WHEN SHE FLEW I WENT TO FEEL IN THE NEST THE TIPS OF MY FINGERS TOUCHED WHAT FELT LIKE ROUND BALLS BUT NOT SATISFIED I PULLED DOWN THE BOUGH AND FOUND ONE ROUND BALL
0688-46588-0032 AND ONE MITE OF A GRAY BACK WITH MICROSCOPIC YELLOW HAIRS ON EACH SIDE OF THE SPINE THE WHOLE TINY BODY SEEMED TO THROB WITH ITS HEART BEATS I WONDERED HOW SUCH A MIDGET COULD EVER BE FED BUT FOUND AS IN THE CASE OF THE HUMMER UNDER THE LITTLE LOVER'S TREE
0688-46588-0033 THAT THE MOTHER GAVE ITS FOOD MOST GENTLY RESERVING HER VIOLENT PUMPING FOR A MORE SUITABLE AGE THOUGH ONE WOULD AS SOON THINK OF POKING A NEEDLE DOWN A BABY'S THROAT AS THAT BILL OFTEN WHILE WATCHING THE NEST MY THOUGHTS WANDERED AWAY TO THE GROVE ITSELF
0688-46588-0034 THE BROWN EARTH BETWEEN THE ROWS WAS BARRED BY ALTERNATE LINES OF SUNLIGHT AND SHADOW AND THE VISTA OF EACH AVENUE ENDED IN BLUE SKY SOMETIMES COOL OCEAN BREEZES WOULD PENETRATE THE FOREST THE ROWS OF TREES WITH THEIR GENTLY SWAYING INTERLACING BRANCHES
0688-46588-0035 CAST MOVING SHADOWS OVER THE SUN TOUCHED LEAFY FLOOR GIVING A WHITE LIGHT TO THE GROVE FOR THE UNDERSIDES OF THE YOUNG EUCALYPTUS LEAVES ARE LIKE SNOW FROM THE STIFF SICKLE SHAPED UPPER LEAVES THE SUN GLANCED DAZZLING THE EYES
0688-46588-0036 MOURNING DOVES COOED AND THE SWEET NOTES OF YELLOW BIRDS FILLED THE SUNNY GROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS OF HAPPINESS A YELLOW BUTTERFLY WANDERED DOWN THE BLUE AISLES SUCH A SECURE RETREAT I RETURNED TO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN COMING IN OUT OF THE HOT YELLOW WORLD
0688-46588-0037 AND CLOSING BEHIND ME THE DOORS OF MY REST HOUSE FOR THE LITTLE WOOD HAD COME TO SEEM LIKE A COOL WAYSIDE CHAPEL A PLACE OF PEACE
0698-122863-0000 ANNE COMES TO GRIEF IN AN AFFAIR OF HONOR ANNE HAD TO LIVE THROUGH MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AS IT HAPPENED ALMOST A MONTH HAVING ELAPSED SINCE THE LINIMENT CAKE EPISODE IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR HER TO GET INTO FRESH TROUBLE OF SOME SORT LITTLE MISTAKES
0698-122863-0001 SUCH AS ABSENTMINDEDLY EMPTYING A PAN OF SKIM MILK INTO A BASKET OF YARN BALLS IN THE PANTRY INSTEAD OF INTO THE PIGS BUCKET AND WALKING CLEAN OVER THE EDGE OF THE LOG BRIDGE INTO THE BROOK WHILE WRAPPED IN IMAGINATIVE REVERIE NOT REALLY BEING WORTH COUNTING
0698-122863-0003 A LITTLE TIRED OF ALL THEIR GAMES AND RIPE FOR ANY ENTICING FORM OF MISCHIEF WHICH MIGHT PRESENT ITSELF THIS PRESENTLY TOOK THE FORM OF DARING DARING WAS THE FASHIONABLE AMUSEMENT AMONG THE AVONLEA SMALL FRY JUST THEN IT HAD BEGUN AMONG THE BOYS BUT SOON SPREAD TO THE GIRLS
0698-122863-0004 AND ALL THE SILLY THINGS THAT WERE DONE IN AVONLEA THAT SUMMER BECAUSE THE DOERS THEREOF WERE DARED TO DO THEM WOULD FILL A BOOK BY THEMSELVES FIRST OF ALL CARRIE SLOANE DARED RUBY GILLIS TO CLIMB TO A CERTAIN POINT IN THE HUGE OLD WILLOW TREE BEFORE THE FRONT DOOR WHICH RUBY GILLIS
0698-122863-0005 ALBEIT IN MORTAL DREAD OF THE FAT GREEN CATERPILLARS WITH WHICH SAID TREE WAS INFESTED AND WITH THE FEAR OF HER MOTHER BEFORE HER EYES IF SHE SHOULD TEAR HER NEW MUSLIN DRESS NIMBLY DID
0698-122863-0006 JOSIE'S TRIUMPH BEING RATHER MORE PRONOUNCED THAN GOOD TASTE PERMITTED ANNE SHIRLEY DARED HER TO WALK ALONG THE TOP OF THE BOARD FENCE WHICH BOUNDED THE GARDEN TO THE EAST NOW TO WALK BOARD FENCES REQUIRES MORE SKILL AND STEADINESS OF HEAD AND HEEL
0698-122863-0007 THAN ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE WHO HAS NEVER TRIED IT BUT JOSIE PYE IF DEFICIENT IN SOME QUALITIES THAT MAKE FOR POPULARITY HAD AT LEAST A NATURAL AND INBORN GIFT DULY CULTIVATED FOR WALKING BOARD FENCES JOSIE WALKED THE BARRY FENCE WITH AN AIRY UNCONCERN WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY
0698-122863-0008 THAT A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT WASN'T WORTH A DARE RELUCTANT ADMIRATION GREETED HER EXPLOIT FOR MOST OF THE OTHER GIRLS COULD APPRECIATE IT HAVING SUFFERED MANY THINGS THEMSELVES IN THEIR EFFORTS TO WALK FENCES JOSIE DESCENDED FROM HER PERCH FLUSHED WITH VICTORY AND DARTED A DEFIANT GLANCE AT ANNE
0698-122863-0009 ANNE TOSSED HER RED BRAIDS I DON'T THINK IT'S SUCH A VERY WONDERFUL THING TO WALK A LITTLE LOW BOARD FENCE SHE SAID I KNEW A GIRL IN MARYSVILLE WHO COULD WALK THE RIDGEPOLE OF A ROOF I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID JOSIE FLATLY I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY COULD WALK A RIDGEPOLE
0698-122863-0010 ALL THE FIFTH CLASS GIRLS SAID OH PARTLY IN EXCITEMENT PARTLY IN DISMAY DON'T YOU DO IT ANNE ENTREATED DIANA YOU'LL FALL OFF AND BE KILLED NEVER MIND JOSIE PYE IT ISN'T FAIR TO DARE ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING SO DANGEROUS I MUST DO IT
0698-122863-0011 MY HONOR IS AT STAKE SAID ANNE SOLEMNLY I SHALL WALK THAT RIDGEPOLE DIANA OR PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT IF I AM KILLED YOU ARE TO HAVE MY PEARL BEAD RING ANNE CLIMBED THE LADDER AMID BREATHLESS SILENCE GAINED THE RIDGEPOLE
0698-122863-0012 BALANCED HERSELF UPRIGHTLY ON THAT PRECARIOUS FOOTING AND STARTED TO WALK ALONG IT DIZZILY CONSCIOUS THAT SHE WAS UNCOMFORTABLY HIGH UP IN THE WORLD AND THAT WALKING RIDGEPOLES WAS NOT A THING IN WHICH YOUR IMAGINATION HELPED YOU OUT MUCH NEVERTHELESS
0698-122863-0013 SHE MANAGED TO TAKE SEVERAL STEPS BEFORE THE CATASTROPHE CAME THEN SHE SWAYED LOST HER BALANCE STUMBLED STAGGERED AND FELL SLIDING DOWN OVER THE SUN BAKED ROOF AND CRASHING OFF IT THROUGH THE TANGLE OF VIRGINIA CREEPER BENEATH ALL BEFORE THE DISMAYED CIRCLE BELOW COULD GIVE A SIMULTANEOUS
0698-122863-0014 TERRIFIED SHRIEK IF ANNE HAD TUMBLED OFF THE ROOF ON THE SIDE UP WHICH SHE HAD ASCENDED
0698-122863-0015 FORTUNATELY SHE FELL ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE THE ROOF EXTENDED DOWN OVER THE PORCH SO NEARLY TO THE GROUND THAT A FALL THEREFROM WAS A MUCH LESS SERIOUS THING NEVERTHELESS WHEN DIANA AND THE OTHER GIRLS HAD RUSHED FRANTICALLY AROUND THE HOUSE
0698-122863-0016 THEY FOUND ANNE LYING ALL WHITE AND LIMP AMONG THE WRECK AND RUIN OF THE VIRGINIA CREEPER ANNE ARE YOU KILLED SHRIEKED DIANA THROWING HERSELF ON HER KNEES BESIDE HER FRIEND OH ANNE DEAR ANNE SPEAK JUST ONE WORD TO ME AND TELL ME IF YOU'RE KILLED TO THE IMMENSE RELIEF OF ALL THE GIRLS
0698-122863-0017 AND ESPECIALLY OF JOSIE PYE WHO IN SPITE OF LACK OF IMAGINATION HAD BEEN SEIZED WITH HORRIBLE VISIONS OF A FUTURE BRANDED AS THE GIRL WHO WAS THE CAUSE OF ANNE SHIRLEY'S EARLY AND TRAGIC DEATH ANNE SAT DIZZILY UP AND ANSWERED UNCERTAINLY NO DIANA I AM NOT KILLED
0698-122863-0018 BUT I THINK I AM RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS WHERE SOBBED CARRIE SLOANE OH WHERE ANNE BEFORE ANNE COULD ANSWER MISSUS BARRY APPEARED ON THE SCENE AT SIGHT OF HER ANNE TRIED TO SCRAMBLE TO HER FEET BUT SANK BACK AGAIN WITH A SHARP LITTLE CRY OF PAIN
0698-122863-0019 WHAT'S THE MATTER WHERE HAVE YOU HURT YOURSELF DEMANDED MISSUS BARRY MY ANKLE GASPED ANNE OH DIANA PLEASE FIND YOUR FATHER AND ASK HIM TO TAKE ME HOME I KNOW I CAN NEVER WALK THERE AND I'M SURE I COULDN'T HOP SO FAR ON ONE FOOT WHEN JANE COULDN'T EVEN HOP AROUND THE GARDEN
0698-122863-0020 MARILLA WAS OUT IN THE ORCHARD PICKING A PANFUL OF SUMMER APPLES WHEN SHE SAW MISTER BARRY COMING OVER THE LOG BRIDGE AND UP THE SLOPE WITH MISSUS BARRY BESIDE HIM AND A WHOLE PROCESSION OF LITTLE GIRLS TRAILING AFTER HIM IN HIS ARMS HE CARRIED ANNE WHOSE HEAD LAY LIMPLY AGAINST HIS SHOULDER
0698-122863-0021 AT THAT MOMENT MARILLA HAD A REVELATION IN THE SUDDEN STAB OF FEAR THAT PIERCED HER VERY HEART SHE REALIZED WHAT ANNE HAD COME TO MEAN TO HER SHE WOULD HAVE ADMITTED THAT SHE LIKED ANNE NAY THAT SHE WAS VERY FOND OF ANNE BUT NOW SHE KNEW AS SHE HURRIED WILDLY DOWN THE SLOPE
0698-122863-0022 THAT ANNE WAS DEARER TO HER THAN ANYTHING ELSE ON EARTH MISTER BARRY WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO HER SHE GASPED MORE WHITE AND SHAKEN THAN THE SELF CONTAINED SENSIBLE MARILLA HAD BEEN FOR MANY YEARS ANNE HERSELF ANSWERED LIFTING HER HEAD DON'T BE VERY FRIGHTENED MARILLA
0698-122863-0023 I WAS WALKING THE RIDGEPOLE AND I FELL OFF I EXPECT I HAVE SPRAINED MY ANKLE BUT MARILLA I MIGHT HAVE BROKEN MY NECK LET US LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THINGS I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN YOU'D GO AND DO SOMETHING OF THE SORT WHEN I LET YOU GO TO THAT PARTY SAID MARILLA SHARP AND SHREWISH IN HER VERY RELIEF
0698-122863-0024 BRING HER IN HERE MISTER BARRY AND LAY HER ON THE SOFA MERCY ME THE CHILD HAS GONE AND FAINTED IT WAS QUITE TRUE OVERCOME BY THE PAIN OF HER INJURY ANNE HAD ONE MORE OF HER WISHES GRANTED TO HER SHE HAD FAINTED DEAD AWAY
0698-122863-0025 MATTHEW HASTILY SUMMONED FROM THE HARVEST FIELD WAS STRAIGHTWAY DISPATCHED FOR THE DOCTOR WHO IN DUE TIME CAME TO DISCOVER THAT THE INJURY WAS MORE SERIOUS THAN THEY HAD SUPPOSED ANNE'S ANKLE WAS BROKEN
0698-122863-0026 A PLAINTIVE VOICE GREETED HER FROM THE BED AREN'T YOU VERY SORRY FOR ME MARILLA IT WAS YOUR OWN FAULT SAID MARILLA TWITCHING DOWN THE BLIND AND LIGHTING A LAMP AND THAT IS JUST WHY YOU SHOULD BE SORRY FOR ME SAID ANNE
0698-122863-0027 BECAUSE THE THOUGHT THAT IT IS ALL MY OWN FAULT IS WHAT MAKES IT SO HARD IF I COULD BLAME IT ON ANYBODY I WOULD FEEL SO MUCH BETTER BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE MARILLA IF YOU HAD BEEN DARED TO WALK A RIDGEPOLE I'D HAVE STAYED ON GOOD FIRM GROUND
0698-122863-0028 AND LET THEM DARE AWAY SUCH ABSURDITY SAID MARILLA ANNE SIGHED BUT YOU HAVE SUCH STRENGTH OF MIND MARILLA I HAVEN'T I JUST FELT THAT I COULDN'T BEAR JOSIE PYE'S SCORN
0698-122863-0029 AND I THINK I HAVE BEEN PUNISHED SO MUCH THAT YOU NEEDN'T BE VERY CROSS WITH ME MARILLA IT'S NOT A BIT NICE TO FAINT AFTER ALL AND THE DOCTOR HURT ME DREADFULLY WHEN HE WAS SETTING MY ANKLE I WON'T BE ABLE TO GO AROUND FOR SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS AND I'LL MISS THE NEW LADY TEACHER
0698-122863-0030 SHE WON'T BE NEW ANY MORE BY THE TIME I'M ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND GIL EVERYBODY WILL GET AHEAD OF ME IN CLASS OH I AM AN AFFLICTED MORTAL
0698-122863-0031 THERE THERE I'M NOT CROSS SAID MARILLA YOU'RE AN UNLUCKY CHILD THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT BUT AS YOU SAY YOU'LL HAVE THE SUFFERING OF IT HERE NOW TRY AND EAT SOME SUPPER ISN'T IT FORTUNATE I'VE GOT SUCH AN IMAGINATION SAID ANNE
0698-122863-0032 IT WILL HELP ME THROUGH SPLENDIDLY I EXPECT WHAT DO PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T ANY IMAGINATION DO WHEN THEY BREAK THEIR BONES DO YOU SUPPOSE MARILLA ANNE HAD GOOD REASON TO BLESS HER IMAGINATION MANY A TIME AND OFT DURING THE TEDIOUS SEVEN WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED BUT SHE WAS NOT SOLELY DEPENDENT ON IT
0698-122863-0033 SHE HAD MANY VISITORS AND NOT A DAY PASSED WITHOUT ONE OR MORE OF THE SCHOOLGIRLS DROPPING IN TO BRING HER FLOWERS AND BOOKS AND TELL HER ALL THE HAPPENINGS IN THE JUVENILE WORLD OF AVONLEA EVERYBODY HAS BEEN SO GOOD AND KIND MARILLA SIGHED ANNE HAPPILY
0698-122863-0034 ON THE DAY WHEN SHE COULD FIRST LIMP ACROSS THE FLOOR IT ISN'T VERY PLEASANT TO BE LAID UP BUT THERE IS A BRIGHT SIDE TO IT MARILLA YOU FIND OUT HOW MANY FRIENDS YOU HAVE WHY EVEN SUPERINTENDENT BELL CAME TO SEE ME AND HE'S REALLY A VERY FINE MAN NOT A KINDRED SPIRIT OF COURSE
0698-122863-0035 BUT STILL I LIKE HIM AND I'M AWFULLY SORRY I EVER CRITICIZED HIS PRAYERS I BELIEVE NOW HE REALLY DOES MEAN THEM ONLY HE HAS GOT INTO THE HABIT OF SAYING THEM AS IF HE DIDN'T HE COULD GET OVER THAT IF HE'D TAKE A LITTLE TROUBLE I GAVE HIM A GOOD BROAD HINT
0698-122863-0036 HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THE TIME HE BROKE HIS ANKLE WHEN HE WAS A BOY IT DOES SEEM SO STRANGE TO THINK OF SUPERINTENDENT BELL EVER BEING A BOY EVEN MY IMAGINATION HAS ITS LIMITS FOR I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WHEN I TRY TO IMAGINE HIM AS A BOY I SEE HIM WITH GRAY WHISKERS AND SPECTACLES
0698-122863-0037 JUST AS HE LOOKS IN SUNDAY SCHOOL ONLY SMALL NOW IT'S SO EASY TO IMAGINE MISSUS ALLAN AS A LITTLE GIRL MISSUS ALLAN HAS BEEN TO SEE ME FOURTEEN TIMES ISN'T THAT SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF MARILLA WHEN A MINISTER'S WIFE HAS SO MANY CLAIMS ON HER TIME
0698-122863-0038 SHE NEVER TELLS YOU IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT AND SHE HOPES YOU'LL BE A BETTER GIRL ON ACCOUNT OF IT MISSUS LYNDE ALWAYS TOLD ME THAT WHEN SHE CAME TO SEE ME AND SHE SAID IT IN A KIND OF WAY THAT MADE ME FEEL SHE MIGHT HOPE I'D BE A BETTER GIRL BUT DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE I WOULD EVEN JOSIE PYE CAME TO SEE ME

0698-123197-0007 FOR THE OLD WAY THROUGH THE HAUNTED WOOD WAS IMPASSABLE WITH DRIFTS AND THE LONG WAY OVER THE FROZEN LAKE OF SHINING WATERS WAS ALMOST AS BAD RUBY GILLIS WAS SLEEPING IN THE WHITE HEAPED GRAVEYARD JANE ANDREWS WAS TEACHING A SCHOOL ON WESTERN PRAIRIES GILBERT TO BE SURE WAS STILL FAITHFUL
0698-123197-0008 AND WADED UP TO GREEN GABLES EVERY POSSIBLE EVENING BUT GILBERT'S VISITS WERE NOT WHAT THEY ONCE WERE ANNE ALMOST DREADED THEM IT WAS VERY DISCONCERTING TO LOOK UP IN THE MIDST OF A SUDDEN SILENCE AND FIND GILBERT'S HAZEL EYES FIXED UPON HER
0698-123197-0009 WITH A QUITE UNMISTAKABLE EXPRESSION IN THEIR GRAVE DEPTHS AND IT WAS STILL MORE DISCONCERTING TO FIND HERSELF BLUSHING HOTLY AND UNCOMFORTABLY UNDER HIS GAZE JUST AS IF JUST AS IF WELL IT WAS VERY EMBARRASSING
0698-123197-0010 AT GREEN GABLES MARILLA WENT PROMPTLY TO MISSUS LYNDE'S DOMAIN WHEN GILBERT CAME AND INSISTED ON TAKING THE TWINS WITH HER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS WAS UNMISTAKABLE AND ANNE WAS IN A HELPLESS FURY OVER IT DAVY HOWEVER WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY

0699-132864-0003 THERE SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DIRECT TO LEAD TO ADVISE TO SUPPORT EXCEPT FREDERICK SHE LONG SINCE HAD LEARNED TO LEAVE FREDERICK TO GOD BEING LED HERSELF BEING INFLUENCED AND THROWN OFF HER FEET BY JUST AN ADVERTISEMENT
0699-132864-0004 BY JUST AN INCOHERENT STRANGER IT WAS INDEED DISTURBING SHE FAILED TO UNDERSTAND HER SUDDEN LONGING
0699-132864-0005 AND ALL HER WAITING AND DEPENDENT POOR WERE LISTENING AND CONDEMNING IT ISN'T AS IF IT COMMITTED US TO ANYTHING SAID MISSUS WILKINS ALSO IN A LOW VOICE BUT HER VOICE SHOOK
0699-132864-0006 THEY GOT UP SIMULTANEOUSLY MISSUS ARBUTHNOT HAD A SENSATION OF SURPRISE THAT MISSUS WILKINS SHOULD BE SO TALL AND WENT TO A WRITING TABLE
0699-132864-0007 BOX ONE THOUSAND THE TIMES FOR PARTICULARS SHE ASKED FOR ALL PARTICULARS BUT THE ONLY ONE THEY REALLY WANTED WAS THE ONE ABOUT THE RENT THEY BOTH FELT THAT IT WAS MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WHO OUGHT TO WRITE THE LETTER AND DO THE BUSINESS PART
0699-132864-0008 SUGGESTED A GREAT CALM THAT COULD ONLY PROCEED FROM WISDOM BUT IF SHE WAS WISER OLDER AND CALMER MISSUS ARBUTHNOT'S NEW FRIEND
0699-132864-0009 NEVERTHELESS SEEMED TO HER TO BE THE ONE WHO IMPELLED INCOHERENT SHE YET IMPELLED SHE APPEARED TO HAVE APART FROM HER NEED OF HELP AN UPSETTING KIND OF CHARACTER
0699-132864-0010 SHE HAD A CURIOUS INFECTIOUSNESS SHE LED ONE ON AND THE WAY HER UNSTEADY MIND LEAPED AT CONCLUSIONS WRONG ONES OF COURSE WITNESS THE ONE THAT SHE MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WAS MISERABLE
0699-132864-0011 AND WHEN THE LETTER HAD BEEN POSTED IN THE LETTER BOX IN THE HALL AND ACTUALLY WAS BEYOND GETTING BACK AGAIN BOTH SHE AND MISSUS WILKINS FELT THE SAME SENSE OF GUILT IT ONLY SHOWS
0699-132864-0012 AS THEY TURNED AWAY FROM THE LETTER BOX HOW IMMACULATELY GOOD WE'VE BEEN ALL OUR LIVES
0699-132864-0013 WE FEEL GUILTY I'M AFRAID I CAN'T SAY I'VE BEEN IMMACULATELY GOOD GENTLY PROTESTED MISSUS ARBUTHNOT A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE AT THIS FRESH EXAMPLE OF SUCCESSFUL LEAPING AT CONCLUSIONS
0699-132864-0014 FOR SHE HAD NOT SAID A WORD ABOUT HER FEELING OF GUILT OH BUT I'M SURE YOU HAVE I SEE YOU BEING GOOD AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT HAPPY SHE SHOULDN'T SAY THINGS LIKE THAT THOUGHT MISSUS ARBUTHNOT

0699-132864-0017 SHE FELT THAT MISSUS WILKINS NEEDED HOLDING ON TO AFTER ALL WE'VE ONLY WRITTEN JUST TO ASK ANYBODY MAY DO THAT I THINK IT QUITE LIKELY WE SHALL FIND THE CONDITIONS IMPOSSIBLE
0699-132864-0018 MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AS SHE PRESENTLY SPLASHED THOUGH THE DRIPPING STREETS ON HER WAY TO A MEETING SHE WAS TO SPEAK AT WAS IN AN UNUSUALLY DISTURBED CONDITION OF MIND SHE HAD SHE HOPED
0699-132864-0019 SHOWN HERSELF VERY CALM TO MISSUS WILKINS VERY PRACTICAL AND SOBER CONCEALING HER OWN EXCITEMENT BUT SHE WAS REALLY EXTRAORDINARILY MOVED AND SHE FELT HAPPY AND SHE FELT GUILTY
0699-132864-0020 AND SHE FELT AFRAID AND SHE HAD ALL THE FEELINGS THOUGH THIS SHE DID NOT KNOW OF A WOMAN WHO WAS COME AWAY FROM A SECRET MEETING WITH HER LOVER THAT INDEED WAS WHAT SHE LOOKED LIKE
0699-132864-0021 EACH ONE CONVINCED THAT THEY NEEDED CONTRIBUTIONS THEMSELVES SHE LOOKED AS THOUGH SHE WERE HIDING SOMETHING DISCREDITABLE BUT DELIGHTFUL CERTAINLY HER CUSTOMARY CLEAR EXPRESSION OF CANDOR WAS NOT THERE
0699-132864-0022 AND ITS PLACE WAS TAKEN BY A KIND OF SUPPRESSED AND FRIGHTENED PLEASEDNESS WHICH WOULD HAVE LED A MORE WORLDLY MINDED AUDIENCE TO THE INSTANT CONVICTION OF RECENT AND PROBABLY IMPASSIONED LOVEMAKING
0699-132864-0023 OR EVEN TO REFLECT WERE USELESS IT YET INFLUENCED HER MISSUS WILKINS'S EYES HAD BEEN THE EYES OF A SEER SOME PEOPLE WERE LIKE THAT MISSUS ARBUTHNOT KNEW
0699-132864-0024 MISSUS ARBUTHNOT SPOKE ON AND ON
0699-132864-0025 AND AT THE END OF THE MEETING HER EYES
0699-132864-0026 PERHAPS THEY NEED A HOLIDAY SUGGESTED MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AN UNSATISFACTORY A QUEER REPLY THE VICAR THOUGHT IN FEBRUARY HE CALLED AFTER HER SARCASTICALLY
0699-132864-0027 OH NO NOT TILL APRIL SAID MISSUS ARBUTHNOT OVER HER SHOULDER VERY ODD THOUGHT THE VICAR VERY ODD INDEED AND HE WENT HOME AND WAS NOT PERHAPS QUITE CHRISTIAN
0699-132864-0028 IT COULD BE THE NEXT NEST EGG WHOSE ORIGINAL CORRUPTION WOULD BE PURGED AWAY BY THE USE TO WHICH IT WAS FINALLY PUT FOR MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WHO HAD NO MONEY OF HER OWN WAS OBLIGED TO LIVE ON THE PROCEEDS OF FREDERICK'S ACTIVITIES
0699-132864-0029 SO THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO PUBLISH A BOOK OF MEMOIRS DURING EACH YEAR OF HIS MARRIED LIFE AND EVEN SO THERE WERE GREATER FURTHER PILES OF THESE LADIES WAITING TO BE DEALT WITH MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WAS HELPLESS
0699-132864-0030 PEOPLE WOULD CEASE TO WANT TO READ OF WICKEDNESS AND THEN FREDERICK WOULD NEED SUPPORTING ON HELPING THE POOR THE PARISH FLOURISHED BECAUSE TO TAKE A HANDFUL AT RANDOM
0699-132864-0031 OF LEARNED MAINTENON THE POOR WERE THE FILTER THROUGH WHICH THE MONEY WAS PASSED TO COME OUT MISSUS ARBUTHNOT HOPED PURIFIED SHE COULD DO NO MORE
0699-132864-0032 SHE HAD TRIED IN DAYS GONE BY TO THINK THE SITUATION OUT TO DISCOVER THE EXACT RIGHT COURSE FOR HER TO TAKE BUT HAD FOUND IT AS SHE HAD FOUND FREDERICK TOO DIFFICULT AND HAD LEFT IT
0699-132864-0033 AS SHE HAD LEFT FREDERICK TO GOD NOTHING OF THIS MONEY WAS SPENT ON HER HOUSE OR DRESS THOSE REMAINED EXCEPT FOR THE GREAT SOFT SOFA AUSTERE
0699-132864-0034 IT WAS THE POOR WHO PROFITED THEIR VERY BOOTS WERE STOUT WITH SINS BUT HOW DIFFICULT IT HAD BEEN MISSUS ARBUTHNOT GROPING FOR GUIDANCE PRAYED ABOUT IT TO EXHAUSTION
0699-132864-0035 HE ONLY BEGAN IT AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE WHEN SHE MARRIED HIM HE HAD BEEN A BLAMELESS OFFICIAL ATTACHED TO THE LIBRARY OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM TO PUBLISH THE MEMOIRS UNDER ANOTHER NAME SO THAT SHE WAS NOT PUBLICLY BRANDED HAMPSTEAD READ THE BOOKS WITH GLEE
0699-132864-0036 HE TOLD MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AS A MATTER OF HONOUR NOT TO MENTION IT AND AT LEAST HER LITTLE HOUSE WAS NOT HAUNTED BY THE LOOSE LIVED LADIES FOR FREDERICK DID HIS WORK AWAY FROM HOME HE HAD TWO ROOMS NEAR THE BRITISH MUSEUM
0699-132864-0037 WHICH WAS THE SCENE OF HIS EXHUMATIONS AND THERE HE WENT EVERY MORNING AND HE CAME BACK LONG AFTER HIS WIFE WAS ASLEEP SOMETIMES HE DID NOT COME BACK AT ALL SOMETIMES SHE DID NOT SEE HIM FOR SEVERAL DAYS TOGETHER
0699-132864-0038 THEN HE WOULD SUDDENLY APPEAR AT BREAKFAST HAVING LET HIMSELF IN WITH HIS LATCHKEY THE NIGHT BEFORE VERY JOVIAL AND GOOD NATURED AND FREE HANDED AND GLAD IF SHE WOULD ALLOW HIM TO GIVE HER SOMETHING A WELL FED MAN CONTENTED WITH THE WORLD
0699-132864-0039 HOWEVER MUCH ONE TABULATED WAS YET A MYSTERY THERE WERE ALWAYS SOME PEOPLE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLACE FREDERICK WAS ONE OF THEM HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BEAR THE REMOTEST RESEMBLANCE TO THE ORIGINAL FREDERICK
0699-132864-0040 HE DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE LEAST NEED OF ANY OF THE THINGS HE USED TO SAY WERE SO IMPORTANT AND BEAUTIFUL LOVE HOME COMPLETE COMMUNION OF THOUGHTS COMPLETE IMMERSION IN EACH OTHER'S INTERESTS
0699-132864-0041 AFTER THOSE EARLY PAINFUL ATTEMPTS TO HOLD HIM UP TO THE POINT FROM WHICH THEY HAD HAND IN HAND SO SPLENDIDLY STARTED ATTEMPTS IN WHICH SHE HERSELF HAD GOT TERRIBLY HURT AND THE FREDERICK SHE SUPPOSED SHE HAD MARRIED WAS MANGLED OUT OF RECOGNITION
0699-132864-0042 SHE HUNG HIM UP FINALLY BY HER BEDSIDE AS THE CHIEF SUBJECT OF HER PRAYERS AND LEFT HIM EXCEPT FOR THOSE ENTIRELY TO GOD SHE HAD LOVED FREDERICK TOO DEEPLY
0699-132864-0043 SHE HAD NOTHING NOBODY OF HER OWN TO LAVISH HERSELF ON THE POOR BECAME HER CHILDREN AND GOD THE OBJECT OF HER LOVE WHAT COULD BE HAPPIER THAN SUCH A LIFE SHE SOMETIMES ASKED HERSELF
0699-132864-0044 BUT HER FACE AND PARTICULARLY HER EYES CONTINUED SAD PERHAPS WHEN WE'RE OLD PERHAPS WHEN WE ARE BOTH QUITE OLD
0699-132866-0000 CHAPTER FOUR IT HAD BEEN ARRANGED THAT MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AND MISSUS WILKINS TRAVELING TOGETHER SHOULD ARRIVE AT SAN SALVATORE ON THE EVENING OF MARCH THIRTY FIRST
0699-132866-0001 WERE TO ARRIVE ON THE MORNING OF APRIL SECOND IN THIS WAY EVERYTHING WOULD BE GOT NICELY READY FOR THE TWO WHO SEEMED IN SPITE OF THE EQUALITY OF THE SHARING YET TO HAVE SOMETHING ABOUT THEM OF GUESTS
0699-132866-0002 WHEN MISSUS WILKINS HER HEART IN HER MOUTH
0699-132866-0003 TERROR AND DETERMINATION TOLD HER HUSBAND THAT SHE HAD BEEN INVITED TO ITALY AND HE DECLINED TO BELIEVE IT OF COURSE HE DECLINED TO BELIEVE IT
0699-132866-0004 BUT AFTER WHAT ENTREATIES WHAT PASSIONATE PERSUADING MISSUS ARBUTHNOT HAD NOT IMAGINED SHE WOULD HAVE TO FACE MISTER WILKINS AND SAY THINGS TO HIM
0699-132866-0005 ONE WOMAN BEING HAPPY AND THESE PITEOUS MULTITUDES SHE WAS UNABLE TO LOOK THE VICAR IN THE FACE HE DID NOT KNOW NOBODY KNEW WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO
0699-132866-0006 AND FROM THE VERY BEGINNING SHE WAS UNABLE TO LOOK ANYBODY IN THE FACE SHE EXCUSED HERSELF FROM MAKING SPEECHES APPEALING FOR MONEY HOW COULD SHE STAND UP AND ASK PEOPLE FOR MONEY
0699-132866-0007 WHEN SHE HERSELF WAS SPENDING SO MUCH ON HER OWN SELFISH PLEASURE NOR DID IT HELP HER OR QUIET HER THAT HAVING ACTUALLY TOLD FREDERICK IN HER DESIRE TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT SHE WAS SQUANDERING THAT SHE WOULD BE GRATEFUL
0699-132866-0008 HE ASKED NO QUESTIONS SHE WAS SCARLET HE LOOKED AT HER A MOMENT AND THEN LOOKED AWAY IT WAS A RELIEF TO FREDERICK THAT SHE SHOULD TAKE SOME MONEY SHE GAVE IT ALL IMMEDIATELY TO THE ORGANIZATION SHE WORKED WITH
0699-132866-0009 AND FOUND HERSELF MORE TANGLED IN DOUBTS THAN EVER MISSUS WILKINS ON THE CONTRARY HAD NO DOUBTS SHE WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS A MOST PROPER THING TO HAVE A HOLIDAY AND ALTOGETHER RIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL
0699-132866-0010 TO SPEND ONE'S OWN HARD COLLECTED SAVINGS ON BEING HAPPY
0699-132866-0012 THERE BEING FIVE IN THAT MARCH AND IT BEING ON THE FIFTH OF THEM THAT SHE AND MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WERE TO START SHE WOULD TELL MELLERSH OF HER INVITATION ON THE THIRD SUNDAY THEN AFTER A VERY WELL COOKED LUNCH
0699-132866-0013 I AM THINKING OF TAKING YOU TO ITALY FOR EASTER AND PAUSED FOR HER ASTOUNDED AND GRATEFUL ECSTASY NONE CAME THE SILENCE IN THE ROOM
0699-132866-0014 AND SHE HAD NOT YET EVEN PREPARED THE FORM OF WORDS IN WHICH SHE WOULD BREAK IT MISTER WILKINS WHO HAD NOT BEEN ABROAD SINCE BEFORE THE WAR AND WAS NOTICING WITH INCREASING DISGUST
0699-132866-0015 AS WEEK FOLLOWED WEEK OF WIND AND RAIN THE PECULIAR PERSISTENT VILENESS OF THE WEATHER AND SLOWLY CONCEIVED A DESIRE TO GET AWAY FROM ENGLAND FOR EASTER
0699-132866-0016 PROBABLY SHE WAS ABSORBED IN SOME FOOLISH DAY DREAM IT WAS REGRETTABLE HOW CHILDISH SHE REMAINED HE TURNED HIS HEAD THEIR CHAIRS WERE IN FRONT OF THE FIRE AND LOOKED AT HER
0699-132866-0017 SHE WAS STARING STRAIGHT INTO THE FIRE AND IT WAS NO DOUBT THE FIRE THAT MADE HER FACE SO RED I AM THINKING HE REPEATED RAISING HIS CLEAR CULTIVATED VOICE AND SPEAKING WITH ACERBITY
0699-132866-0018 FOR INATTENTION AT SUCH A MOMENT WAS DEPLORABLE OF TAKING YOU TO ITALY FOR EASTER DID YOU NOT HEAR ME YES SHE HAD HEARD HIM
0699-132866-0019 REALLY MOST EXTRAORDINARY
0699-132866-0020 HOW SHE HAD BEEN INVITED A FRIEND HAD INVITED HER EASTER TOO EASTER WAS IN APRIL WASN'T IT
0699-132866-0021 A HAD A HOUSE THERE IN FACT MISSUS WILKINS DRIVEN BY TERROR GUILT AND SURPRISE HAD BEEN MORE INCOHERENT IF POSSIBLE THAN USUAL
0699-132866-0022 IT WAS A DREADFUL AFTERNOON MELLERSH PROFOUNDLY INDIGNANT BESIDES HAVING HIS INTENDED TREAT COMING BACK ON HIM LIKE A BLESSING TO ROOST
0699-132866-0023 CROSS EXAMINED HER WITH THE UTMOST SEVERITY HE DEMANDED THAT SHE REFUSE THE INVITATION HE DEMANDED THAT SINCE SHE HAD SO OUTRAGEOUSLY ACCEPTED IT WITHOUT CONSULTING HIM
0699-132866-0024 WE'RE NOT ANY LONGER REAL HUMAN BEINGS REAL HUMAN BEINGS AREN'T EVER AS GOOD AS WE'VE BEEN OH SHE CLENCHED HER THIN HANDS TO THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO BE SO HAPPY NOW
0699-132866-0025 MISSUS ARBUTHNOT ALWAYS SILENT ABOUT HIM HAD SAID NOTHING OF THIS TO MISSUS WILKINS FREDERICK WENT TOO DEEP INTO HER HEART FOR HER TO TALK ABOUT HIM
0699-132866-0026 SURE AS SHE SO MISERABLY WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION TO ANYTHING SHE DID SHE MERELY WROTE HIM A NOTE AND PUT IT ON THE HALL TABLE READY FOR HIM IF AND WHEN HE SHOULD COME HOME
0699-132866-0027 THERE WAS NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD HE WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED HE WOULD NOT CARE THE DAY WAS WRETCHED BLUSTERING AND WET THE CROSSING WAS ATROCIOUS AND THEY WERE VERY SICK
0699-132866-0028 BUT AFTER HAVING BEEN VERY SICK JUST TO ARRIVE AT CALAIS AND NOT BE SICK WAS HAPPINESS AND IT WAS THERE THAT THE REAL SPLENDOUR OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING FIRST BEGAN TO WARM THEIR BENUMBED SPIRITS
0699-132866-0029 IT GOT HOLD OF MISSUS WILKINS FIRST AND SPREAD FROM HER LIKE A ROSE COLOURED FLAME OVER HER PALE COMPANION MELLERSH AT CALAIS WHERE THEY RESTORED THEMSELVES WITH SOLES
0699-132866-0030 NOT A SINGLE OFFICIAL AT CALAIS CARED A FIG FOR MELLERSH IN PARIS THERE WAS NO TIME TO THINK OF HIM BECAUSE THEIR TRAIN WAS LATE
0699-132866-0031 AND BY THE AFTERNOON OF THE NEXT DAY WHEN THEY GOT INTO ITALY ENGLAND FREDERICK MELLERSH THE VICAR THE POOR HAMPSTEAD THE CLUB SHOOLBRED
0699-132866-0032 EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING THE WHOLE INFLAMED SORE DREARINESS

0699-132882-0001 IN ORDER TO ANSWER HER INQUIRES AND KEEP HER THERE TO HIMSELF HE PROCEEDED TO INVENT IT WAS QUITE EASY TO FASTEN SOME OF THE ENTERTAINING THINGS HE WAS CONSTANTLY THINKING ON TO OTHER PEOPLE
0699-132882-0002 AND PRETEND THEY WERE THEIRS SCRAP WHO HAD THAT AFFECTION FOR HER PARENTS WHICH WARMS IN ABSENCE WAS ATHIRST FOR NEWS AND BECAME MORE AND MORE INTERESTED BY THE NEWS HE GRADUALLY IMPARTED

0699-132882-0004 AND ALSO ANY CHARMING FUNNY THINGS THAT HAD BEEN DONE OR MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE FOR HE COULD IMAGINE ALMOST ANYTHING SCRAP'S EYES GREW ROUND WITH WONDER AND AFFECTIONATE PRIDE IN HER MOTHER
0699-132882-0005 FANCY MOTHER WHAT AN OLD DARLING DID SHE REALLY DO THAT HOW PERFECTLY ADORABLE OF HER AND DID SHE REALLY SAY BUT HOW WONDERFUL OF HER TO THINK OF IT
0699-132882-0006 WHAT SORT OF A FACE DID LLOYD GEORGE MAKE SHE LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AND HAD A GREAT LONGING TO HUG HER MOTHER AND THE TIME FLEW AND IT GREW QUITE DUSK AND IT GREW NEARLY DARK
0699-132882-0007 AND MISTER ARUNDEL STILL WENT ON AMUSING HER AND IT WAS A QUARTER TO EIGHT BEFORE SHE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED DINNER OH GOOD HEAVENS SHE EXCLAIMED JUMPING UP YES IT'S LATE SAID ARUNDEL
0699-132882-0008 ARUNDEL FOLLOWED HE DID NOT WISH TO ARRIVE TOO HOT SO HAD TO GO SLOWLY FORTUNATELY HE WAS NEAR THE TOP AND FRANCESCA CAME DOWN THE PERGOLA TO PILOT HIM INDOORS
0699-132882-0009 DRAWING ROOM DOOR WAS OPEN AND THE HOUSE WAS QUIET WITH THE HUSH THAT PRECEDES DINNER WHEN THE INHABITANTS ARE ALL SHUT UP IN THEIR ROOMS DRESSING BRIGGS IN HIS ROOM
0699-132882-0010 WAS THROWING AWAY SPOILT TIE AFTER SPOILT TIE SCRAP IN HERS WAS HURRYING INTO A BLACK FROCK WITH A VAGUE NOTION THAT MISTER BRIGGS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE HER SO CLEARLY IN BLACK
0699-132882-0011 TIED TOGETHER BY A BLUE ENAMEL RIBBON ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN GOLD LETTERS ESTO PERPETUA MISTER WILKINS WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED BRUSHING HIS WIFE'S HAIR
0699-132882-0012 THUS FAR IN THIS THIRD WEEK HAD HE PROGRESSED IN DEMONSTRATIVENESS WHILE SHE FOR HER PART SITTING ON A CHAIR IN FRONT OF HIM PUT HIS STUDS IN A CLEAN SHIRT AND ROSE
0699-132882-0013 LOTTY WOULD HAVE REMOVED IT BY THE FRANK COMMENTS SHE MADE WHILE SHE AND ROSE SAT TOGETHER AFTER TEA ON THE WALL LOTTY WAS DELIGHTED AT MORE LOVE BEING INTRODUCED INTO SAN SALVATORE EVEN IF IT WERE ONLY ONE SIDED
0699-132882-0014 BETWEEN TEA AND DINNER THINKING OF HIM HARDER THAN EVER
0699-132882-0015 BUT OF COURSE IT COULDN'T GO ON ONCE CAROLINE APPEARED ROSE KNEW HER PLACE SHE COULD SEE AS WELL AS ANY ONE THE UNUSUALLY
0699-132882-0016 OF LADY CAROLINE HOW WARM THOUGH THINGS LIKE ADMIRATION AND APPRECIATION MADE ONE FEEL HOW CAPABLE OF REALLY DESERVING THEM HOW DIFFERENT HOW GLOWING
0699-132882-0017 THEY SEEMED TO QUICKEN UNSUSPECTED FACULTIES INTO LIFE SHE WAS SURE SHE HAD BEEN A THOROUGHLY AMUSING WOMAN BETWEEN LUNCH AND TEA AND A PRETTY ONE TOO SHE WAS QUITE CERTAIN SHE HAD BEEN PRETTY
0699-132882-0018 SHE STILL BUZZED SHE STILL TINGLED JUST AT THE REMEMBRANCE WHAT FUN IT HAD BEEN HAVING AN ADMIRER EVEN FOR THAT LITTLE WHILE NO WONDER PEOPLE LIKED ADMIRERS
0699-132882-0019 AND VERY NEARLY SHE STUCK A CRIMSON CAMELLIA IN HER HAIR DOWN BY HER EAR SHE DID HOLD IT THERE FOR A MINUTE AND IT LOOKED ALMOST SINFULLY ATTRACTIVE AND WAS EXACTLY THE COLOUR OF HER MOUTH
0699-132882-0020 SOON SHE WOULD BE BACK WITH THEM AGAIN AND WHAT WOULD A CAMELLIA BEHIND HER EAR SEEM LIKE THEN SIMPLY FANTASTIC BUT ON ONE THING SHE WAS DETERMINED
0699-132882-0021 THE FIRST THING SHE WOULD DO WHEN SHE GOT HOME WOULD BE TO HAVE IT OUT WITH FREDERICK IF HE DIDN'T COME TO SAN SALVATORE THAT IS WHAT SHE WOULD DO THE VERY FIRST THING LONG AGO SHE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE THIS
0699-132882-0022 BUT ALWAYS SHE HAD BEEN HANDICAPPED WHEN SHE TRIED TO BY BEING SO DREADFULLY FOND OF HIM AND SO MUCH AFRAID THAT FRESH WOUNDS WERE GOING TO BE GIVEN HER WRETCHED SOFT HEART BUT NOW
0699-132882-0023 LET HIM WOUND HER AS MUCH AS HE CHOSE AS MUCH AS HE POSSIBLY COULD SHE WOULD STILL HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM NOT THAT HE EVER INTENTIONALLY WOUNDED HER SHE KNEW HE NEVER MEANT TO
0699-132882-0024 SHE KNEW HE OFTEN HAD NO IDEA OF HAVING DONE IT FOR A PERSON WHO WROTE BOOKS THOUGHT ROSE FREDERICK DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH IMAGINATION ANYHOW SHE SAID TO HERSELF
0699-132882-0025 GETTING UP FROM THE DRESSING TABLE THINGS COULDN'T GO ON LIKE THIS SHE WOULD HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM THIS SEPARATE LIFE THIS FREEZING LONELINESS
0699-132882-0026 SHE LOOKED AT HER LITTLE CLOCK STILL TEN MINUTES BEFORE DINNER TIRED OF STAYING IN HER BEDROOM SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD GO ON TO MISSUS FISHER'S BATTLEMENTS WHICH WOULD BE EMPTY AT THIS HOUR
0699-132882-0027 AND WATCH THE MOON RISE OUT OF THE SEA SHE WENT INTO THE DESERTED UPPER HALL WITH THIS INTENTION BUT WAS ATTRACTED ON HER WAY ALONG IT BY THE FIRELIGHT SHINING THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR OF THE DRAWING ROOM
0699-132882-0028 HOW GAY IT LOOKED THE FIRE TRANSFORMED THE ROOM A DARK UGLY ROOM IN THE DAYTIME IT WAS TRANSFORMED JUST AS SHE HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED BY THE WARMTH OF
0699-132882-0029 AND OUTSIDE THE DEEP SLITS OF WINDOWS HUNG THE BLUE CURTAIN OF THE NIGHT HOW PRETTY WHAT A SWEET PLACE SAN SALVATORE WAS AND THAT GORGEOUS LILAC ON THE TABLE
0699-132882-0030 SHE MUST GO AND PUT HER FACE IN IT BUT SHE NEVER GOT TO THE LILAC SHE WENT ONE STEP TOWARDS IT AND THEN STOOD STILL FOR SHE HAD SEEN THE FIGURE LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW IN THE FARTHEST CORNER
0699-132882-0031 SO HE NEEDED HER FOR HE HAD COME INSTANTLY SO HE TOO MUST HAVE BEEN THINKING LONGING HER HEART WHICH HAD SEEMED TO STOP BEATING WAS SUFFOCATING HER NOW
0699-132882-0032 THE WAY IT RACED ALONG FREDERICK DID LOVE HER THEN HE MUST LOVE HER OR WHY HAD HE COME SOMETHING PERHAPS HER ABSENCE HAD MADE HIM TURN TO HER WANT HER
0699-132882-0033 BUT NO SOUND CAME OR IF IT DID THE CRACKLING OF THE FIRE COVERED IT UP SHE MUST GO NEARER SHE BEGAN TO CREEP TOWARDS HIM SOFTLY SOFTLY HE DID NOT MOVE
0699-132882-0034 HE HAD NOT HEARD SHE STOLE NEARER AND NEARER AND THE FIRE CRACKLED AND HE HEARD NOTHING SHE STOPPED A MOMENT UNABLE TO BREATHE SHE WAS AFRAID SUPPOSE HE
0922-132291-0000 FELDMAN HAD SET HIS LEGS THE PROBLEM OF HEADING FOR THE GREAT SPACEPORT AND ESCAPE FROM EARTH AND HE LET THEM TAKE HIM WITHOUT FURTHER GUIDANCE HIS MIND WAS WRAPPED UP IN A WHIRL OF THE PAST HIS PAST AND THAT OF THE WHOLE PLANET
0922-132291-0001 BOTH PASTS HAD IN COMMON THE GROWTH AND SUDDEN RUIN OF IDEALISM IDEALISM THROUGHOUT HISTORY SOME MEN HAD SOUGHT THE IDEAL AND MOST HAD CALLED IT FREEDOM ONLY FOOLS EXPECTED ABSOLUTE FREEDOM
0922-132291-0002 BUT WISE MEN DREAMED UP MANY SYSTEMS OF RELATIVE FREEDOM INCLUDING DEMOCRACY THEY HAD TRIED THAT IN AMERICA AS THE LAST FLING OF THE DREAM IT HAD BEEN A GOOD ATTEMPT TOO THE MEN WHO DREW THE CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN PRETTY PRACTICAL DREAMERS
0922-132291-0003 THEY CAME TO THEIR TASK AFTER A BITTER WAR AND A WORSE PERIOD OF WILD CHAOS AND THEY HAD LEARNED WHERE IDEALISM STOPPED AND IDIOCY BEGAN THEY SET UP A REPUBLIC WITH ALL THE ELEMENTS OF DEMOCRACY THAT THEY CONSIDERED SAFE
0922-132291-0004 THAT KIND OF TALK DIDN'T GET FAR PEOPLE WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT RIGHTS NOT ABOUT DUTIES THEY TOOK THE PHRASE THAT ALL MEN WERE CREATED EQUAL AND LEFT OUT THE IMPLIED KICKER THAT EQUALITY WAS IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND BEFORE THE LAW
0922-132291-0005 THEY WANTED AN EQUALITY WITH THE GREATEST MEN WITHOUT GIVING UP THEIR DRIVE TOWARD MEDIOCRITY AND THEY MEANT TO HAVE IT IN A WAY THEY GOT IT THEY GOT THE VOTE EXTENDED TO EVERYONE THE MAN ON SUBSIDY OR PUBLIC DOLE COULD VOTE TO DEMAND MORE
0922-132291-0006 THE MAN WHO READ OF NOTHING BEYOND SEX CRIMES COULD VOTE ON THE GREAT POLITICAL ISSUES OF THE WORLD NO ABILITY WAS NEEDED FOR HIS VOTE IN FACT HE WAS ASSURED THAT VOTING ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM A FINE AND NOBLE CITIZEN HE LOVED THAT
0922-132291-0007 IF HE BOTHERED TO VOTE AT ALL THAT YEAR HE BECAME A GREAT MAN BY LISTING HIS UNTHOUGHT HUNGRY DESIRE FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY SO HE WENT OUT AND VOTED FOR THE MAN WHO PROMISED HIM MOST
0922-132291-0008 OR WHO LOOKED MOST LIKE WHAT HIS LIMITED DREAMS FELT TO BE A FATHER IMAGE OR SON IMAGE OR HERO IMAGE HE NEVER BOTHERED LATER TO SEE HOW THE MEN HE'D ELECTED HAD HANDLED THE JOBS HE HAD GIVEN THEM SOMEONE HAD TO LOOK OF COURSE AND SOMEONE DID
0922-132291-0009 ORGANIZED SPECIAL INTERESTS STEPPED IN WHERE THE MOB HAD FAILED LOBBIES GREW UP THERE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PRESSURE GROUPS BUT NOW THEY DEVELOPED INTO A THIRD ARM OF THE GOVERNMENT THE OLD FARM LOBBY WAS UNBEATABLE
0922-132291-0010 IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT GREW UP SO FAST IT NEVER EVEN KNEW IT WASN'T A REAL PART OF THE GOVERNMENT IT DEVELOPED DURING A PERIOD OF CHAOS WHEN ANOTHER COUNTRY CALLED RUSSIA GOT THE FIRST HUNK OF METAL ABOVE THE ATMOSPHERE
0922-132291-0011 AND WHEN THE REPRESENTATIVES WHO HAD BEEN PICKED FOR EVERYTHING BUT THEIR GRASP OF SCIENCE AND GOVERNMENT WENT INTO PANIC OVER A MYTH OF NATIONAL PRESTIGE THE SPACE EFFORT WAS TURNED OVER TO THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY
0922-132291-0012 WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE ITSELF SUCCESSFULLY EXCEPT UNDER THE STIMULUS OF WAR OR A THREAT OF WAR THE FAILING AIRPLANE INDUSTRY BECAME THE SPACE COMBINE OVERNIGHT AND NOBODY KEPT TRACK OF HOW BIG IT WAS EXCEPT A FEW SHARP OPERATORS
0922-132291-0013 THEY WORKED OUT A SYSTEM OF SUBCONTRACTS THAT SPREAD THE PROFITS SO WIDE THAT HARDLY A COMPANY OF ANY SIZE IN THE COUNTRY WASN'T GETTING A SHARE THUS A LOT OF PATRIOTIC NOBLE VOTERS GOT THEIR PAY FROM COMPANIES IN THE LOBBY BLOCK
0922-132291-0014 AND COULD BE PANICKED BY THE LOBBY AT THE FIRST MENTION OF RECESSION SO SPACE LOBBY TOOK OVER COMPLETELY IN ITS OWN FIELD IT DEVELOPED ENOUGH PRESSURE TO GET WHATEVER APPROPRIATIONS IT WANTED EVEN OVER PRESIDENTIAL VETO IT CREATED THE ONLY SPACE EXPERTS
0922-132291-0015 WHICH MEANT THAT THE MEN PLACED IN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO REGULATE IT CAME FROM ITS OWN RANKS THE OTHER LOBBIES LEARNED A LOT FROM SPACE THERE HAD BEEN A MEDICAL LOBBY LONG BEFORE BUT IT HAD BEEN A CONSERVATIVE GROUP MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH PROTECTING MEDICAL AUTONOMY AND ETHICS
0922-132291-0016 IT ALSO TRIED TO PREVENT GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF TREATMENT AND PAYMENT FEELING THAT IT COULDN'T TRUST THE PEOPLE TO KNOW WHERE TO STOP BUT ITS HISTORY WAS A LONG SERIES OF RETREATS IT FOUGHT WHAT IT CALLED SOCIALIZED MEDICINE
0922-132291-0017 BUT THE PEOPLE WANTED THEIR TROUBLES HANDLED FREE WHICH MEANT BY GOVERNMENT SPENDING SINCE THAT COULD BE ADDED TO THE NATIONAL DEBT AND THUS DIDN'T SEEM TO COST ANYTHING IT LOST AND EVENTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT PAID MOST MEDICAL COSTS
0922-132291-0018 THEN QUANTITY OF TREATMENT PAID RATHER THAN QUALITY COMPETENCE NO LONGER MATTERED SO MUCH THE LOBBY LOST BUT DIDN'T KNOW IT BECAUSE THE LOWERED STANDARDS OF COMPETENCE IN THE PROFESSION LOWERED THE CALIBER OF MEN RUNNING THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THAT PROFESSION AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE LOBBY
0922-132291-0019 IT WIPED OUT TWO BILLION PEOPLE DEPOPULATED AFRICA AND MOST OF ASIA AND WRECKED EUROPE LEAVING ONLY AMERICA COMPARATIVELY SAFE TO TAKE OVER
0922-132291-0020 AN OBSCURE SCIENTIST IN ONE OF THE LABORATORIES RUN BY THE MEDICAL LOBBY FOUND A CURE BEFORE THE FIRST WAVES OF THE EPIDEMIC HIT AMERICA RUTHERFORD RYAN THEN HEAD OF THE LOBBY MADE SURE THAT MEDICAL LOBBY GOT ALL THE CREDIT BY THE TIME THE WORLD RECOVERED AMERICA RAN IT
0922-132291-0021 AND THE MEDICAL LOBBY WAS UNTOUCHABLE RYAN MADE A DEAL WITH SPACE LOBBY AND THE TWO EFFECTIVELY RAN THE WORLD NONE OF THE SMALLER LOBBIES COULD BUCK THEM AND NEITHER COULD THE GOVERNMENT THERE WAS STILL A PRESIDENT AND A CONGRESS
0922-132291-0022 AS THERE HAD BEEN A SENATE UNDER THE ROMAN CAESARS BUT THE TWO LOBBIES RAN THEMSELVES AS THEY CHOSE THE REAL GOVERNMENT HAD BECOME A KIND OF OLIGARCHY AS IT ALWAYS DID AFTER TOO MUCH FALSE DEMOCRACY RUINED THE IDEALS OF REAL AND PRACTICAL SELF RULE
0922-132291-0023 THEY HAD VERY LITTLE TO WORRY ABOUT FOR THAT FOR SECURITY AND THE RIGHT NOT TO THINK MOST PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE SOME RULES SEEMED HARSH OF COURSE
0922-132291-0024 SUCH AS THE LAW THAT ALL OPERATIONS HAD TO BE PERFORMED IN LOBBY HOSPITALS BUT THAT COULD BE JUSTIFIED IT WAS THE ONLY SAFE KIND OF SURGERY AND THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS NO UNSUPERVISED EXPERIMENTATION SUCH AS THAT WHICH SUPPOSEDLY CAUSED THE PLAGUE
0922-132291-0025 THE RULE WAS NOW AN ABSOLUTE ETHIC OF MEDICINE IT ALSO MADE FOR BETTER FEES FELDMAN'S FATHER HAD STUCK BY THE RULE BUT HAD QUESTIONED IT FELDMAN LEARNED NOT TO QUESTION IN MEDICAL SCHOOL HE SCORED SECOND IN MEDICAL ETHICS ONLY
0922-132291-0026 TO CHRISTINA RYAN HE HAD NEVER FIGURED WHY SHE SINGLED HIM OUT FOR HER ATTENTIONS BUT HE GLORIED IN BOTH THOSE ATTENTIONS AND THE RESULTS HE BECAME AUTOMATICALLY A RISING YOUNG MAN THE FAVORITE OF THE DAUGHTER OF THE LOBBY PRESIDENT
0922-132291-0027 IN RETURN HE AGREED TO FOLLOW THAT PERIOD BY BECOMING AN ADMINISTRATOR A DOCTOR'S DOCTOR AS THEY PUT IT THEY WERE MARRIED IN APRIL AND HIS OFFICE WAS READY IN MAY COMPLETE WITH A STAFF OF EIGHTY THE PUBLICITY RELEASES HAD GONE OUT
0922-132291-0028 AND THE PUBLIC RELATIONS LOBBY THAT HANDLED NEWS AND EDUCATION WAS PAID TO BEGIN THE GREATEST BUILD UP ANY YOUNG GENIUS EVER HAD THEY CELEBRATED THAT WITH A LITTLE PARTY OF SOME FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE AND REPORTERS AT RYAN'S LODGE IN CANADA
0922-132291-0029 IT WAS TO BE A GALA WEEKEND IT WAS THEN THAT BAXTER SHOT HIMSELF BAXTER HAD BEEN FELDMAN'S CLOSEST FRIEND IN THE LOBBY HE'D COME ALONG TO HANDLE PRESS RELATIONS AND HAD GOTTEN ROMANTIC ABOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE
0922-132291-0030 NEVER HAVING BEEN OUT OF A CITY BEFORE HE HIRED A GUIDE AND WENT HUNTING EIGHTY MILES BEYOND THE LAST OUTPOST OF CIVILIZATION SOMEHOW HE GOT HIS HAND ON A GUN THOUGH ONLY GUIDES WERE SUPPOSED TO TOUCH THEM
0922-132291-0031 MANAGED TO OVERCOME ITS SAFETY DEVICES AND THEN PULLED THE TRIGGER WITH THE GUN POINTED THE WRONG WAY CHRIS FELDMAN AND HARNETT FROM PUBLIC RELATIONS HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM ON THE TRIP THEY WERE SITTING IN A NEARBY CAR WHILE FELDMAN ENJOYED THE SCENERY
0922-132291-0032 CHRIS MADE FURTHER PLANS AND HARNETT GATHERED MATERIAL THERE WAS ALSO A PHOTOGRAPHER AND WRITER BUT THEY HADN'T BEEN INTRODUCED BY NAME FELDMAN REACHED BAXTER FIRST THE MAN WAS MOANING AND SCARED AND HE WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY
0922-132291-0034 AND I'LL SPREAD IT IN EVERY ONE OF OUR MEDIA I'LL HAVE TO IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO RETAIN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE THERE'D BE A LEAK WITH ALL THE GUIDES AND OTHERS HERE AND WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT I LIKE YOU YOU HAVE COLOR BUT TOUCH THAT WOUND
0922-132291-0035 AND I'LL CRUCIFY YOU CHRIS ADDED HER OWN THREATS SHE'D SPENT YEARS MAKING HIM THE OUTLET FOR ALL HER AMBITIONS DENIED BECAUSE WOMEN WERE STILL ONLY SECOND RATE MEMBERS OF MEDICAL LOBBY SHE COULDN'T LET IT GO NOW
0922-132291-0036 AND ONLY ANODYNE TABLETS IN PLACE OF ANESTHESIA HE GOT THE BULLET OUT AND SEWED UP THE WOUND WITH A BIT OF SURGICAL THREAD HE'D BEEN USING TO TIE UP A TORN GOOD LUCK EMBLEM THE PHOTOGRAPHER AND WRITER RECORDED THE WHOLE THING
0922-132291-0037 CHRIS SWORE HARSHLY AND BEAT HER FISTS AGAINST THE BOLE OF A TREE BUT BAXTER LIVED HE RECOVERED COMPLETELY AND WAS SHOCKED AT THE HEINOUS THING THAT HAD BEEN DONE TO HIM
0922-132299-0000 THERE WERE ALSO TIMES WHEN IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER AND WHEN HIS ONLY THOUGHTS WERE FOR THE VILLAGES AND THE PLAGUE THEY BROUGHT HIM THE PAPERS WHERE HE WAS PAINTED AS A MONSTER BESIDE WHOM JACK THE RIPPER AND ALBRECHT DELIER WERE GENTLE AMATEURS
0922-132299-0001 BUT THERE WERE ALSO SIGNS THAT THE LOBBY WAS WORRIED AS IF AFRAID THAT SOME ATTEMPT MIGHT STILL BE MADE TO RESCUE HIM HE'D LOOKED FORWARD TO THE TRIP TO THE AIRPORT AS A WAY OF JUDGING PUBLIC REACTION
0922-132299-0002 BUT APPARENTLY THE LOBBY HAD NO DESIRE TO TEST THAT THE GUARDS LED HIM UP TO THE ROOF OF THE JAIL WHERE A ROCKET WAS WAITING THE LANDING SPACE WAS TOO SMALL FOR ONE OF THE STATION SHUTTLES BUT A LITTLE NORTHPORT SOUTHPORT SHUTTLE WAS PARKED THERE
0922-132299-0003 AFTER WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN A DIFFICULT SET DOWN THE GUARDS TESTED DOC'S MANACLES AND FORCED HIM INTO THE SHUTTLE INSIDE CHRIS WAS WAITING CARRYING AN OFFICIAL AUTOMATIC
0922-132299-0004 THE SHUTTLE LIFTED SLUGGISHLY BUT THERE WAS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY DOC COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS EVEN SOME FUEL REMAINING WHEN THEY SLIPPED INTO THE TUBE AT THE ORBITAL STATION CHRIS WENT OUT AND OTHER GUARDS CAME IN TO FREE HIM
0922-132299-0005 SO LONG DOCTOR FELDMAN THE PILOT CALLED SOFTLY AS THEY LED HIM OUT THEN THE GUARDS SHOVED HIM THROUGH THE AIRLOCK INTO THE STATION FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER HE WAS LOCKED INTO ONE OF THE CABINS OF THE IROQUOIS WITH ALL HIS POSSESSIONS STACKED BESIDE HIM
0922-132299-0006 BUT FINALLY HE RECEIVED A SURLY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT STEWARD WHATCHA WANT HOW'S THE CHANCE OF GETTING SOME FOOD YOU'RE ON FIRST CLASS THEY COULD AFFORD IT DOC DECIDED HE WOULDN'T COST THEM MUCH
0922-132299-0007 CONSIDERING THE DISTANCE HE WAS GOING BRING ME TWO COMPLETE DINNERS ONE EARTH NORMAL AND ONE MARS NORMAL OKAY FELDMAN
0922-132299-0008 A SHARP CLICK INTERRUPTED HIM THAT'S ENOUGH STEWARD CAPTAIN EVERTS SPEAKING DOCTOR FELDMAN YOU HAVE MY APOLOGIES UNTIL YOU REACH YOUR DESTINATION YOU ARE MY PASSENGER AND ENTITLED TO EVERY CONSIDERATION OF ANY OTHER PASSENGER EXCEPT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT THROUGH THE SHIP
0922-132299-0009 I AM ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS FELDMAN SHOOK HIS HEAD HE'D HEARD OF SUCH MEN BUT HE'D THOUGHT THE SPECIES EXTINCT THE STEWARD BROUGHT HIS FOOD IN A THOROUGHLY CHASTENED MANNER HE MANAGED TO FIND SPACE FOR IT
0922-132299-0010 SIR FOR A MOMENT AS THE SMELL OF REAL STEAK REACHED HIM DOC REGRETTED THE FACT THAT HIS METABOLISM HAD BEEN SWITCHED THEN HE SHRUGGED A LITTLE WOULDN'T HURT HIM THOUGH THERE WAS NO PROPER NOURISHMENT IN IT
0922-132299-0011 HE SQUEEZED SOME OF THE GRAVY AND BITS OF MEAT INTO ONE OF HIS BOTTLES STICKING TO HIS PURPOSE THEN HE FELL TO ON THE REST BUT AFTER A FEW BITES IT WAS QUEERLY UNSATISFACTORY THE SEEMINGLY UNAPPEALING MARS NORMAL RAGOUT SUITED HIS CURRENT TASTES BETTER AFTER ALL
0922-132299-0012 IT WAS BETTER THAN WASTING HIS TIME IN DREAD HE MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO LEAVE SOME NOTES BEHIND A GONG SOUNDED AND A RED LIGHT WARNED HIM THAT ACCELERATION WAS DUE HE FINISHED WITH HIS BOTTLES PUT THEM INTO THE INCUBATOR
0922-132299-0013 AND PILED INTO HIS BUNK SWALLOWING ONE OF THE TABLETS OF MORPHETAL THE SHIP FURNISHED ACCELERATION HAD ENDED
0922-132299-0014 HE FLIPPED THE SWITCH WHILE REACHING FOR THE COFFEE CAPTAIN EVERTS THE SPEAKER SAID MAY I JOIN YOU IN YOUR CABIN COME AHEAD FELDMAN INVITED HE CUT OFF THE SWITCH AND GLANCED AT THE CLOCK ON THE WALL THERE WERE LESS THAN ELEVEN HOURS LEFT TO HIM
0922-132299-0015 THERE WAS NEITHER FRIENDLINESS NOR HOSTILITY IN HIS GLANCE HIS WORDS WERE COURTEOUS AS DOC MOTIONED TOWARD THE TRAY OF BREAKFAST I'VE ALREADY EATEN THANK YOU HE ACCEPTED A CHAIR HIS VOICE WAS APOLOGETIC WHEN HE BEGAN
0922-132299-0016 THIS IS A PERSONAL MATTER WHICH I PERHAPS HAVE NO RIGHT TO BRING UP BUT MY WIFE IS GREATLY WORRIED ABOUT THIS PLAGUE
0922-132299-0017 THE SHIP PHYSICIAN BELIEVES MISSUS EVERTS MAY HAVE THE PLAGUE BUT ISN'T SURE OF THE SYMPTOMS I
0922-132299-0018 DOC WONDERED ABOUT THE PHYSICIAN APPARENTLY THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN WHO PLACED HIS PATIENTS ABOVE ANYTHING ELSE THOUGH HE WAS PROBABLY METICULOUS ABOUT OBEYING ALL ACTUAL RULES THERE WAS NO LAW AGAINST LISTENING TO A PARIAH AT LEAST
0922-132299-0019 WE WENT THROUGH IT TOGETHER SHORTLY AFTER HAVING OUR METABOLISM SWITCHED DURING THE FOOD SHORTAGE OF EIGHTY EIGHT
0922-132299-0020 THE SWELLING WAS THERE HE ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS BUT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT BOTH OF YOU MUST HAVE IT CAPTAIN THOUGH IT WON'T MATURE FOR ANOTHER YEAR I'M SORRY THERE'S NO HOPE THEN
0922-132299-0021 BUT THANK YOU HE GOT TO HIS FEET AND LEFT AS QUIETLY AND ERECTLY AS HE HAD ENTERED DOC TORE UP HIS NOTES BITTERLY HE PACED HIS CABIN SLOWLY READING OUT THE HOURS WHILE HIS EYES LINGERED ON THE LITTLE BOTTLE OF CULTURES
0922-132299-0022 AT TIMES THE FEAR GREW IN HIM BUT HE MASTERED IT THERE WAS HALF AN HOUR LEFT WHEN HE BEGAN OPENING THE LITTLE BOTTLES AND MAKING HIS FILMS HE WAS STILL NOT FINISHED WHEN STEPS ECHOED DOWN THE HALL BUT HE WAS REASONABLY SURE OF HIS RESULTS
0922-132299-0023 DOC FORCED HIS HANDS TO STEADINESS WITH FOOLISH PRIDE AND BEGAN CLIMBING INTO THE SUIT HE REACHED FOR THE HELMET BUT THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD POINTING TO THE OXYGEN GAUGE THERE WOULD BE EXACTLY ONE HOUR'S SUPPLY OF OXYGEN WHEN HE WAS THROWN OUT
0922-132299-0024 AND IT STILL LACKED FIVE MINUTES OF THE DEADLINE THEY MARCHED HIM DOWN THE HALLWAY TO MEET EVERTS COMING TOWARD THEM THERE WERE STILL THREE MINUTES LEFT WHEN THEY REACHED THE AIRLOCK WITH ITS INNER DOOR ALREADY OPEN THE SPACESUITED MAN CLIMBED INTO IT
0922-132299-0025 AND BEGAN STRAPPING DOWN SO THAT THE RUSH OF AIR WOULD NOT SWEEP HIM OUTWARD WHEN THE OTHER SEAL WAS RELEASED DOC HAD SAVED ONE BRACKY WEED NOW HE RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS FUMBLING FOR A LIGHT
0922-132299-0026 BETTER CHANGE YOUR METABOLISM BACK TO EARTH NORMAL CAPTAIN EVERTS HE SAID AND HIS VOICE WAS SO NORMAL THAT HE HARDLY RECOGNIZED IT EVERTS EYES WIDENED BRIEFLY THE MAN BOWED FAINTLY THANK YOU
0922-132299-0027 DOCTOR FELDMAN IT WAS RIDICULOUS IMPOSSIBLE AND YET THERE WAS A CURIOUS RELIEF AT THE FORMALITY OF IT IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING FROM A PLAY TOO UNREAL TO AFFECT HIS LIFE EVERTS NODDED TO THE MAN HOLDING THE HELMET
0922-132299-0028 DOC DROPPED HIS BRACKY WEED AND FELT THE HELMET SNAP DOWN A HISS OF OXYGEN REACHED HIM AND THE SUIT BALLOONED OUT THERE WAS NO GRAVITY THE TWO MEN HANDED HIM UP EASILY TO THE ONE IN THE AIRLOCK WHILE THE INNER SEAL BEGAN TO CLOSE
0922-132299-0029 THERE WAS STILL TEN SECONDS TO GO ACCORDING TO THE BIG CHRONOMETER THAT HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN THE LOCK THE SPACEMAN USED IT IN TYING THE SACK OF POSSESSIONS FIRMLY TO DOC'S SUIT A RED LIGHT WENT ON
0922-132299-0030 THE MAN CAUGHT DOC AND HELD HIM AGAINST THE OUTER SEAL THE RED LIGHT BLINKED FOUR SECONDS THREE TWO THERE WAS A SUDDEN HEAVY THUDDING SOUND AND THE IROQUOIS SEEMED TO JERK SIDEWAYS SLIGHTLY
0922-132300-0000 CONVERT FELDMAN FOUGHT FOR CONTROL OF HIMSELF FORCED HIMSELF TO THINK TO HOLD ONTO HIS SANITY
0922-132300-0001 BUT THE WILL TO BE HIMSELF WAS STRONGER THAN LOGIC AND BIT BY BIT HE FORCED THE FEAR AND HORROR AWAY FROM HIM UNTIL HE COULD EXAMINE HIS SITUATION HE WAS SPINNING SLOWLY SO THAT STARS AHEAD OF HIM SEEMED TO CRAWL ACROSS HIS VIEW
0922-132300-0002 THE SHIP WAS RETREATING FROM HIM ALREADY HUNDREDS OF YARDS AWAY MARS WAS A SHRUNKEN PILL FAR AWAY THEN SOMETHING BLINKED TO ONE SIDE HE TURNED HIS HEAD TO STARE
0922-132300-0003 A LITTLE SHIP WAS LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY HE RECOGNIZED IT AS A LIFE RAFT NOW HIS SPIN BROUGHT HIM AROUND TO FACE IT AND HE SAW IT WAS PARALLELLING HIS COURSE
0922-132300-0004 THE EJECTION OF THE LIFE RAFT MUST HAVE CAUSED THE THUMP HE'D HEARD BEFORE HE WAS CAST ADRIFT IT MEANT SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO SAVE HIM IT MEANT LIFE HE FLAILED HIS ARMS AND BEAT HIS LEGS TOGETHER
0922-132300-0005 AND THE LITTLE SHIP LEAPED FORWARD WHOEVER WAS HANDLING IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT PILOTING IT PICKED UP TOO MUCH SPEED AT TOO GREAT AN ANGLE AGAIN BLUE SPURTS CAME BUT THIS TIME MATTERS WERE EVEN WORSE
0922-132300-0006 THEN THERE WAS A LONG WAIT BEFORE A THIRD TRY WAS MADE HE ESTIMATED THE COURSE IT WOULD MISS HIM BY A GOOD HUNDRED FEET BUT IT WAS PROBABLY THE BEST THE AMATEUR PILOT COULD DO THE SHIP DRIFTED CLOSER BUT TO ONE SIDE IT WOULD SOON PASS HIM COMPLETELY
0922-132300-0007 A SPACESUITED FIGURE SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE TINY AIRLOCK HOLDING A COIL OF ROPE THE ROPE SHOT OUT WELL THROWN BUT IT WAS TOO SHORT IT WOULD PASS WITHIN TEN FEET AND MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN TEN MILES FOR ALL THE GOOD IT WOULD DO HIM
0922-132300-0008 EVERY FILM HE HAD SEEN ON SPACE SEEMED TO FORM A MAD JUMBLE IN HIS MIND BUT HE SEIZED ON THE FIRST IDEA HE COULD REMEMBER HE INHALED DEEPLY AND YANKED THE OXYGEN TANK FREE AN AUTOMATIC SEAL ON THE SUIT CUT OFF THE CONNECTION
0922-132300-0009 HE AIMED THE HISSING BOTTLE FUMBLING FOR THE MANUAL VALVE IT ALMOST WORKED IT KICKED HIM TOWARD THE ROPE SLIGHTLY BUT MOST OF THE ENERGY WAS WASTED IN SETTING HIM INTO A WILDER SPIN HE BLINKED TRYING TO SPOT THE ROPE
0922-132300-0010 IT WAS WITHIN FIVE FEET NOW AGAIN HE WAITED UNTIL HE SEEMED TO BE IN POSITION THIS TIME HE THREW THE BOTTLE AWAY FROM IT IT ADDED SPIN TO HIS VERTICAL AXIS BUT THE ROPE CAME INTO VIEW WITHIN ARM'S REACH HE GRASPED IT
0922-132300-0011 JUST AS HIS LUNGS SEEMED ABOUT TO BURST HE COULDN'T HOLD ON LONG ENOUGH TO TIE THE ROPE HIS LUNGS GAVE UP SUDDENLY COLLAPSING AND THEN SUCKING IN GREEDILY CLEAN AIR RUSHED IN LETTING HIS HEAD CLEAR
0922-132300-0012 HE'D FORGOTTEN THAT THE INFLATED SUIT HELD ENOUGH OXYGEN FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HIS BODY STRUCK THE EDGE OF THE AIRLOCK AND A HAND JERKED HIM INSIDE THE OUTER SEAL WAS SLAMMED SHUT AND LOCKED AND THERE WAS A HISS OF AIR ENTERING
0922-132300-0013 HE THREW BACK HIS HELMET JUST AS CHRIS RYAN JERKED HERS OFF HER VOICE SHOOK ALMOST HYSTERICALLY THANK GOD DAN I ALMOST GAVE UP I LIKED THE AIR OUT THERE BETTER HE TOLD HER BITTERLY IF YOU'LL OPEN THE LOCK AGAIN I'LL LEAVE
0922-132300-0014 I CAME ALONG TO SEE YOU KILLED AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL SAVING YOU WASN'T IN MY ORDERS HE GRUNTED AND REACHED FOR THE HANDLE THAT WOULD RELEASE THE OUTER LOCK
0922-132300-0015 IT'S UP TO YOU DAN SHE TOLD HIM AND THERE WAS ALL THE SINCERITY IN THE WORLD IN HER BLUE EYES I'M ON YOUR SIDE NOW HE BEGAN COUNTING ON HIS FINGERS LET'S SEE THE SPARE BATTERY
0922-132300-0016 THE DELAY IN ARRESTING ME THE CHOICE OF MATTHEWS IT WAS ALL TRUE ANGER BEGAN TO GROW IN HER EYES DAN FELDMAN YOU GET INSIDE THIS RAFT IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THE PEOPLE DYING OF THE PLAGUE WHO NEED YOU
0922-132300-0017 ADDRESSED TO MISSUS D E EVERTS AND SIGNED BY ONE OF THE BEST DOCTORS ON THE LOBBY BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGRET CONFIRM DIAGNOSIS TOPSECRET REPEAT TOPSECRET MARTIAN FEVER INCUBATES FOURTEEN YEARS BELIEVED HIGHLY FATAL NO CURE
0922-132300-0018 RESEARCH BEGINNING IMMEDIATELY PENALTY VIOLATION TOPSECRET DEATH ALL CONCERNED MISSUS EVERTS RATES A TOPSECRET BREAK DOC COMMENTED DRYLY COME OFF IT CHRIS SHE'S THE DAUGHTER OF ELMERS OF SPACE LOBBY CHRIS ANSWERED
0922-132300-0019 SHE POINTED TO THE MESSAGE UNDERLINING WORDS WITH HER FINGER FOURTEEN YEARS YOU COULDN'T HAVE CAUSED IT HIGHLY FATAL AND PEOPLE ARE BEING TOLD IT'S ONLY A SKIN DISEASE RESEARCH BEGINNING BUT YOU'VE ALREADY DONE MOST OF THE RESEARCH I CAN SEE THAT NOW
0922-132300-0020 I CAN'T PROVE MY MOTIVES YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO BELIEVE ME BUT IT WASN'T HARD TO DO WHAT I'VE DONE THAT SHUTTLE PILOT WAS FOUND IN A ROUTINE CHECK STOWED AWAY ON THE LIFE RAFT I WAS WITH CAPTAIN EVERTS WHEN HE WAS FOUND SO I DISCOVERED HOW TO GET INTO THE RAFT
0922-132300-0021 THE PILOT'S FAREWELL ADDRESSING HIM AS DOCTOR FELDMAN HAD BEEN TOO LOW FOR HER TO HEAR BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT FITTED HER STORY IT WAS PROBABLY A DELIBERATE CLUE TO GIVE HIM HOPE TO ASSURE HIM THE VILLAGES WERE STILL TRYING IT SHOOK HIS CONFIDENCE
0922-132300-0022 AND YOU'VE DECIDED YOUR PRECIOUS LOBBY WON'T SAVE YOU SHE DROPPED HER EYES THEN RAISED THEM TO MEET HIS DEFIANTLY I'M NOT JUST SCARED AND SELFISH DAD CAUGHT IT TOO AND IT MUST BE CLOSE TO THE TIME FOR HIM
0922-132300-0023 THERE WAS A MANUAL LEVER WHICH CHRIS MUST HAVE USED BEFORE IT MIGHT WORK OUT HERE WHERE THERE WAS ROOM TO MANEUVER AND NOTHING TO HIT BUT TRYING TO MAKE A LANDING WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT DAN SHE REPEATED HE SHRUGGED I DON'T KNOW
0922-132300-0024 THEY'VE STARTED RESEARCH TOO LATE AND THEY'LL BE UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE THAT THE REAL BRAINS WON'T HAVE A CHANCE THE TOPSECRET STUFF LOOKS BAD FOR RESEARCH MAYBE THERE'S A CURE IT WORKS IN CULTURE BOTTLES BUT IT MAY FAIL IN PERSON
0922-132300-0025 WHEN I'M CONVINCED I'M SAFE WITH YOU I MAY TELL YOU ABOUT IT OH HER VOICE WAS LOW THEN SHE SIGHED I SUPPOSE I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HATE ME DAN I DON'T HATE YOU I'M TOO MIXED UP TOMORROW MAYBE BUT NOT NOW
0922-132300-0026 SHUT UP AND LET ME SEE IF I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO LAND THIS THING HE FOUND THAT THE FUEL TANKS WERE NEARLY FULL BUT THAT STILL DIDN'T LEAVE MUCH MARGIN
0922-132300-0027 THEY HAD NO ASPIRATORS HOWEVER AND THEY COULDN'T COVER MUCH TERRITORY IN THE SPACESUITS THEY WOULD HAVE TO USE IT MEANT HE'D HAVE TO LAND CLOSE TO A VILLAGE WHERE HE WAS KNOWN HE JOCKEYED THE SHIP AROUND BY TRIAL AND ERROR STUDYING THE MANUAL THAT WAS LYING PROMINENTLY ON THE CONTROL PANEL
0922-132300-0028 ACCORDING TO THE BOOKLET THE SHIP WAS SIMPLE TO OPERATE IT WAS SELF LEVELING IN AN ATMOSPHERE AND AUTOMATIC FLARE COMPUTERS WERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR AN AMATEUR TO JUDGE THE RATE OF DESCENT NEAR THE SURFACE IT LOOKED REASSURING AND WAS PROBABLY WRITTEN WITH THAT IN MIND
0922-132300-0029 FINALLY HE REACHED FOR THE CONTROL HOPING HE'D FIGURED HIS LANDING ORBIT REASONABLY WELL BY SIMPLE LOGIC HE SMOOTHED IT OUT IN THE FOLLOWING HOURS AS HE WATCHED THE MARKINGS ON MARS WHEN THEY WERE NEAR TURNOVER POINT
0922-132300-0030 HE BEGAN CRANKING THE LITTLE GYROSCOPE TO SWING THE SHIP IT SAVED FUEL TO TURN WITHOUT POWER
0922-132300-0031 HE WAS GAINING SOME PROFICIENCY HOWEVER HE FELT BUT NOW HE HAD TO WASTE FUEL AND RUIN HIS ORBIT AGAIN THERE WAS NO WAY TO PRACTICE MANEUVERING WITHOUT ACTUALLY DOING SO IN THE END HE COMPROMISED
0922-132300-0032 LEAVING A SMALL MARGIN FOR A BAD LANDING THAT WOULD REQUIRE A SECOND ATTEMPT BUT WITH LESS PRACTICE THAN HE WANTED HE HAD LOCATED JAKE'S VILLAGE THROUGH THE LITTLE TELESCOPE WHEN HE FINALLY REACHED FOR THE MAIN BLAST CONTROL
0922-132300-0033 WHILE THE BLAST LASHED OUT THEN THEY WERE IN THE OUTER FRINGES OF THE SKY AND THE BLAST WAS BEGINNING TO SHOW A CORONA THAT RUINED VISIBILITY HE TURNED TO THE FLARE COMPUTER AND BACK TO WHAT HE COULD SEE THROUGH THE QUARTZ VIEWPORT
0922-132300-0034 AS NEARLY AS HE COULD JUDGE THE COMPUTER SEEMED TO WORK AS IT SHOULD THE SPEED WAS WITHIN ACCEPTABLE LIMITS
0922-132300-0035 THE FLARE BLOOMED AND HE YANKED DOWN ON THE LITTLE LEVER IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE THEY HIT THE GROUND BOUNCED TWICE AND TURNED OVER THE SHIP WAS A MESS WHEN FELDMAN FREED HIMSELF FROM THE ELASTIC STRAPS OF THE SEAT
0922-132300-0036 CHRIS HAD SHRIEKED AS THEY HIT BUT SHE WAS UNBUCKLING HERSELF NOW HE THREW HER HER SPACESUIT AND ONE OF THE EMERGENCY BOTTLES OF OXYGEN FROM THE RACK HURRY UP WITH THAT
0922-132300-0037 THEY WERE HALFWAY TO THE VILLAGE WHEN A DOZEN TRACTORS CAME RACING UP AND JAKE PILED OUT OF THE LEAD ONE TO DRAG THE TWO IN WITH HIM HEARD ABOUT IT FROM THE BROADCASTS AND FIGURED YOU MIGHT LAND AROUND HERE GOOD TO SEE YOU DOC
0922-132300-0038 HE STARTED THE TRACTOR OFF AT FULL SPEED BACK TO THE WASTELANDS WHILE DOC STARED AT THE ARMED MEN WHO WERE RIDING THE TRACTORS JAKE CAUGHT HIS LOOK AND NODDED YOU'RE IN ENEMY TERRITORY DOC
0925-8140-0000 NOTHING COULD BE MORE STRIKING THAN TO FIND THIS HERE WE ARE INCLINED TO LOOK UPON BAD TEMPER AS A VERY HARMLESS WEAKNESS WE SPEAK OF IT AS A MERE INFIRMITY OF NATURE A FAMILY FAILING A MATTER OF TEMPERAMENT
0925-8140-0001 AS ONE OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE ELEMENTS IN HUMAN NATURE THE PECULIARITY OF ILL TEMPER IS THAT IT IS THE VICE OF THE VIRTUOUS
0925-8140-0002 OR TOUCHY DISPOSITION THIS COMPATIBILITY OF ILL TEMPER WITH HIGH MORAL CHARACTER IS ONE OF THE STRANGEST AND SADDEST PROBLEMS OF ETHICS
0925-8140-0003 SINS OF THE BODY AND SINS OF THE DISPOSITION THE PRODIGAL SON MAY BE TAKEN AS A TYPE OF THE FIRST THE ELDER BROTHER OF THE SECOND
0925-8140-0004 ITS BRAND FALLS WITHOUT A CHALLENGE UPON THE PRODIGAL BUT ARE WE RIGHT
0925-8140-0005 AND COARSER AND FINER ARE BUT HUMAN WORDS BUT FAULTS IN THE HIGHER NATURE MAY BE LESS VENAL THAN THOSE IN THE LOWER AND TO THE EYE OF HIM WHO IS LOVE A SIN AGAINST LOVE
0925-8140-0006 MAY SEEM A HUNDRED TIMES MORE BASE NO FORM OF VICE NOT WORLDLINESS NOT GREED OF GOLD NOT DRUNKENNESS ITSELF DOES MORE TO UN CHRISTIANIZE SOCIETY
0925-8140-0007 FOR TAKING THE BLOOM OF CHILDHOOD IN SHORT FOR SHEER GRATUITOUS MISERY PRODUCING POWER THIS INFLUENCE STANDS ALONE
0925-8140-0008 LOOK AT THE ELDER BROTHER MORAL HARD WORKING PATIENT DUTIFUL LET HIM GET ALL CREDIT FOR HIS VIRTUES LOOK AT THIS MAN THIS BABY
0925-8140-0009 HE WAS ANGRY WE READ AND WOULD NOT GO IN LOOK AT THE EFFECT UPON THE FATHER UPON THE SERVANTS UPON THE HAPPINESS OF THE GUESTS
0925-8140-0010 AND HOW MANY PRODIGALS ARE KEPT OUT OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD
0925-8140-0011 ANALYZE AS A STUDY IN TEMPER THE THUNDER CLOUD ITSELF AS IT GATHERS UPON THE ELDER BROTHER'S BROW WHAT IS IT MADE OF JEALOUSY ANGER
0925-8140-0012 IN VARYING PROPORTIONS ALSO THESE ARE THE INGREDIENTS OF ALL ILL TEMPER JUDGE IF SUCH SINS OF THE DISPOSITION ARE NOT WORSE TO LIVE IN
0925-8140-0013 THERE IS REALLY NO PLACE IN HEAVEN FOR A DISPOSITION LIKE THIS A MAN WITH SUCH A MOOD COULD ONLY MAKE HEAVEN MISERABLE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE IN IT
0925-8140-0014 EXCEPT THEREFORE SUCH A MAN BE BORN AGAIN HE CANNOT
0925-8140-0015 IT IS NOT IN WHAT IT IS ALONE BUT IN WHAT IT REVEALS
0925-8140-0016 THE OCCASIONAL BUBBLE ESCAPING TO THE SURFACE WHICH BETRAYS SOME ROTTENNESS UNDERNEATH A SAMPLE OF THE MOST HIDDEN PRODUCTS OF THE SOUL DROPPED INVOLUNTARILY
0925-8140-0017 A WANT OF KINDNESS A WANT OF GENEROSITY A WANT OF COURTESY A WANT OF UNSELFISHNESS ARE ALL INSTANTANEOUSLY SYMBOLIZED IN ONE FLASH OF TEMPER
0925-8140-0018 HENCE IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH THE TEMPER WE MUST GO TO THE SOURCE AND CHANGE THE INMOST NATURE AND THE ANGRY HUMORS WILL DIE AWAY OF THEMSELVES
0925-8140-0019 SOULS ARE MADE SWEET NOT BY TAKING THE ACID FLUIDS OUT
0925-8140-0020 A GREAT LOVE A NEW SPIRIT THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST CHRIST THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST INTERPENETRATING OURS SWEETENS PURIFIES TRANSFORMS ALL
0925-8140-0021 TIME DOES NOT CHANGE MEN CHRIST DOES THEREFORE LET THAT MIND BE IN YOU WHICH WAS ALSO IN CHRIST JESUS
0925-8140-0022 SOME OF US HAVE NOT MUCH TIME TO LOSE REMEMBER ONCE MORE
0925-8140-0023 I CANNOT HELP SPEAKING URGENTLY FOR MYSELF FOR YOURSELVES WHOSO SHALL OFFEND ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONES WHICH BELIEVE IN ME IT WERE BETTER FOR HIM
0925-8140-0024 NOT TO LIVE THAN NOT TO LOVE IT IS BETTER NOT TO LIVE THAN NOT TO LOVE GUILELESSNESS
0925-8140-0025 GUILELESSNESS IS THE GRACE FOR SUSPICIOUS PEOPLE
0925-8140-0026 IS THE GREAT SECRET OF PERSONAL INFLUENCE YOU WILL FIND IF YOU THINK FOR A MOMENT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO INFLUENCE YOU ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN YOU IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF SUSPICION MEN SHRIVEL UP
0925-8140-0027 BUT IN THAT ATMOSPHERE THEY EXPAND AND FIND ENCOURAGEMENT AND EDUCATIVE FELLOWSHIP IT IS A WONDERFUL THING THAT HERE AND THERE IN THIS HARD UNCHARITABLE WORLD
0925-8140-0028 THERE SHOULD STILL BE LEFT A FEW RARE SOULS WHO THINK NO EVIL THIS IS THE GREAT UNWORLDLINESS LOVE THINKETH NO EVIL
0925-8140-0029 IMPUTES NO MOTIVE SEES THE BRIGHT SIDE PUTS THE BEST CONSTRUCTION ON EVERY ACTION WHAT A DELIGHTFUL STATE OF MIND TO LIVE IN
0925-8140-0030 WHAT A STIMULUS AND BENEDICTION EVEN TO MEET WITH IT FOR A DAY TO BE TRUSTED IS TO BE SAVED AND IF WE TRY TO INFLUENCE OR ELEVATE OTHERS
0925-8140-0031 WE SHALL SOON SEE THAT SUCCESS IS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR BELIEF OF OUR BELIEF IN THEM
0925-8140-0032 IS THE FIRST RESTORATION OF THE SELF RESPECT A MAN HAS LOST OUR IDEAL OF WHAT HE IS BECOMES TO HIM THE HOPE AND PATTERN OF WHAT HE MAY BECOME
0925-8140-0033 I HAVE CALLED THIS SINCERITY FROM THE WORDS RENDERED IN THE AUTHORIZED VERSION BY REJOICETH IN THE TRUTH AND CERTAINLY WERE THIS THE REAL TRANSLATION NOTHING COULD BE MORE JUST
0925-8140-0034 FOR HE WHO LOVES WILL LOVE TRUTH NOT LESS THAN MEN HE WILL REJOICE IN THE TRUTH REJOICE NOT IN WHAT HE HAS BEEN TAUGHT TO BELIEVE NOT IN THIS CHURCH'S DOCTRINE OR IN THAT
0925-8140-0035 NOT IN THIS ISM OR IN THAT ISM BUT IN THE TRUTH HE WILL ACCEPT ONLY WHAT IS REAL HE WILL STRIVE TO GET AT FACTS
0925-8140-0036 HE WILL SEARCH FOR TRUTH WITH A HUMBLE AND UNBIASED MIND AND CHERISH WHATEVER HE FINDS AT ANY SACRIFICE BUT THE MORE LITERAL TRANSLATION OF THE REVISED VERSION
0925-8140-0037 CALLS FOR JUST SUCH A SACRIFICE FOR TRUTH'S SAKE HERE FOR WHAT PAUL REALLY MEANT IS
0925-8140-0038 BUT REJOICETH WITH THE TRUTH A QUALITY WHICH PROBABLY NO ONE ENGLISH WORD AND CERTAINLY NOT SINCERITY ADEQUATELY DEFINES
0925-8140-0039 IT INCLUDES PERHAPS MORE STRICTLY THE SELF RESTRAINT WHICH REFUSES TO MAKE CAPITAL OUT OF OTHERS FAULTS
0925-8140-0040 THE CHARITY WHICH DELIGHTS NOT IN EXPOSING THE WEAKNESS OF OTHERS BUT COVERETH ALL THINGS
0925-8141-0000 SO MUCH FOR THE ANALYSIS OF LOVE NOW THE BUSINESS OF OUR LIVES IS TO HAVE THESE THINGS FITTED INTO OUR CHARACTERS
0925-8141-0001 TO LEARN LOVE IS LIFE NOT FULL OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING LOVE EVERY MAN AND WOMAN EVERY DAY HAS A THOUSAND OF THEM THE WORLD IS NOT A PLAYGROUND IT IS A SCHOOLROOM
0925-8141-0002 LIFE IS NOT A HOLIDAY BUT AN EDUCATION AND THE ONE ETERNAL LESSON FOR US ALL IS HOW BETTER WE CAN LOVE WHAT MAKES A MAN A GOOD CRICKETER
0925-8141-0003 PRACTICE WHAT MAKES A MAN A GOOD ARTIST A GOOD SCULPTOR A GOOD MUSICIAN PRACTICE WHAT MAKES A MAN A GOOD LINGUIST A GOOD STENOGRAPHER PRACTICE
0925-8141-0004 WHAT MAKES A MAN A GOOD MAN PRACTICE NOTHING ELSE THERE IS NOTHING CAPRICIOUS ABOUT RELIGION WE DO NOT GET THE SOUL IN DIFFERENT WAYS UNDER DIFFERENT LAWS
0925-8141-0005 FROM THOSE IN WHICH WE GET THE BODY AND THE MIND IF A MAN DOES NOT EXERCISE HIS ARM HE DEVELOPS NO BICEPS MUSCLE AND IF A MAN DOES NOT EXERCISE HIS SOUL
0925-8141-0006 HE ACQUIRES NO MUSCLE IN HIS SOUL NO STRENGTH OF CHARACTER NO VIGOR OF MORAL FIBRE NO BEAUTY OF SPIRITUAL GROWTH LOVE IS NOT A THING OF ENTHUSIASTIC EMOTION
0925-8141-0007 IT IS A RICH STRONG MANLY VIGOROUS EXPRESSION OF THE WHOLE ROUND CHRISTIAN CHARACTER THE CHRISTLIKE NATURE IN ITS FULLEST DEVELOPMENT
0925-8141-0008 AND THE CONSTITUENTS OF THIS GREAT CHARACTER ARE ONLY TO BE BUILT UP BY CEASELESS PRACTICE WHAT WAS CHRIST DOING IN THE CARPENTER'S SHOP PRACTISING
0925-8141-0009 THOUGH PERFECT WE READ THAT HE LEARNED OBEDIENCE
0925-8141-0010 DO NOT QUARREL THEREFORE WITH YOUR LOT IN LIFE DO NOT COMPLAIN OF ITS NEVER CEASING CARES ITS PETTY ENVIRONMENT THE VEXATIONS YOU HAVE TO STAND
0925-8141-0011 THE SMALL AND SORDID SOULS YOU HAVE TO LIVE AND WORK WITH ABOVE ALL DO NOT RESENT TEMPTATION DO NOT BE PERPLEXED BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO THICKEN ROUND YOU MORE AND MORE
0925-8141-0012 AND CEASES NEITHER FOR EFFORT NOR FOR AGONY
0925-8141-0013 AND IT IS HAVING ITS WORK IN MAKING YOU PATIENT AND HUMBLE AND GENEROUS AND UNSELFISH AND KIND AND COURTEOUS
0925-8141-0014 DO NOT GRUDGE THE HAND THAT IS MOULDING THE STILL TOO SHAPELESS IMAGE WITHIN YOU IT IS GROWING MORE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH YOU SEE IT NOT AND EVERY TOUCH OF TEMPTATION
0925-8141-0015 MAY ADD TO ITS PERFECTION THEREFORE KEEP IN THE MIDST OF LIFE DO NOT ISOLATE YOURSELF BE AMONG MEN AND AMONG THINGS
0925-8141-0016 AND AMONG TROUBLES AND DIFFICULTIES AND OBSTACLES
0925-8141-0017 CHARACTER IN THE STREAM OF LIFE TALENT DEVELOPS ITSELF IN SOLITUDE THE TALENT OF PRAYER OF FAITH OF MEDITATION OF SEEING THE UNSEEN
0925-8141-0018 CHARACTER GROWS IN THE STREAM OF THE WORLD'S LIFE THAT CHIEFLY IS WHERE MEN ARE TO LEARN LOVE HOW NOW HOW
0925-8141-0019 TO MAKE IT EASIER I HAVE NAMED A FEW OF THE ELEMENTS OF LOVE BUT THESE ARE ONLY ELEMENTS LOVE ITSELF CAN NEVER BE DEFINED
0925-8141-0020 LIGHT IS A SOMETHING MORE THAN THE SUM OF ITS INGREDIENTS A GLOWING DAZZLING TREMULOUS ETHER AND LOVE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN ALL ITS ELEMENTS
0925-8141-0021 A PALPITATING QUIVERING SENSITIVE LIVING THING BY SYNTHESIS OF ALL THE COLORS MEN CAN MAKE WHITENESS THEY CANNOT MAKE LIGHT
0925-8141-0022 BY SYNTHESIS OF ALL THE VIRTUES MEN CAN MAKE VIRTUE THEY CANNOT MAKE LOVE HOW THEN ARE WE TO HAVE THIS TRANSCENDENT LIVING WHOLE
0925-8141-0023 CONVEYED INTO OUR SOULS WE BRACE OUR WILLS TO SECURE IT WE TRY TO COPY THOSE WHO HAVE IT WE LAY DOWN RULES ABOUT IT WE WATCH WE PRAY
0925-8141-0024 BUT THESE THINGS ALONE WILL NOT BRING LOVE INTO OUR NATURE LOVE IS AN EFFECT AND ONLY AS WE FULFILL THE RIGHT CONDITION
0925-8141-0025 CAN WE HAVE THE EFFECT PRODUCED SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT THE CAUSE IS IF YOU TURN TO THE REVISED VERSION OF THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN
0925-8141-0026 WE LOVE BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED US WE LOVE NOT WE LOVE HIM THAT IS THE WAY THE OLD VERSION HAS IT AND IT IS QUITE WRONG
0925-8141-0027 WE LOVE BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED US LOOK AT THAT WORD BECAUSE IT IS THE CAUSE OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN
0925-8141-0028 BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED US THE EFFECT FOLLOWS THAT WE LOVE WE LOVE HIM WE LOVE ALL MEN WE CANNOT HELP IT
0925-8141-0029 OUR HEART IS SLOWLY CHANGED CONTEMPLATE THE LOVE OF CHRIST AND YOU WILL LOVE STAND BEFORE THAT MIRROR
0925-8141-0030 REFLECT CHRIST'S CHARACTER AND YOU WILL BE CHANGED INTO THE SAME IMAGE FROM TENDERNESS TO TENDERNESS THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CANNOT LOVE TO ORDER
0925-8141-0031 YOU CAN ONLY LOOK AT THE LOVELY OBJECT AND FALL IN LOVE WITH IT AND GROW INTO LIKENESS TO IT AND SO LOOK AT THIS PERFECT CHARACTER
0925-8141-0032 AND YOU MUST LOVE HIM AND LOVING HIM YOU MUST BECOME LIKE HIM LOVE BEGETS LOVE IT IS A PROCESS OF INDUCTION
0925-8141-0033 THEY ARE BOTH MAGNETS ALIKE REMAIN SIDE BY SIDE WITH HIM WHO LOVED US AND GAVE HIMSELF FOR US
0925-8141-0034 LIKE HIM YOU WILL BE DRAWN UNTO ALL MEN THAT IS THE INEVITABLE EFFECT OF LOVE ANY MAN WHO FULFILLS THAT CAUSE
0925-8141-0035 MUST HAVE THAT EFFECT PRODUCED IN HIM TRY TO GIVE UP THE IDEA THAT RELIGION COMES TO US BY CHANCE OR BY MYSTERY OR BY CAPRICE IT COMES TO US BY NATURAL LAW
0925-8141-0036 AND WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM HE JUST PUT HIS HAND ON THE SUFFERER'S HEAD AND SAID MY BOY GOD LOVES YOU AND WENT AWAY
0925-8141-0037 AND CALLED OUT TO THE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE GOD LOVES ME
0925-8141-0038 THE SENSE THAT GOD LOVED HIM OVERPOWERED HIM MELTED HIM DOWN
0925-8141-0039 AND THAT IS HOW THE LOVE OF GOD MELTS DOWN THE UNLOVELY HEART IN MAN AND BEGETS IN HIM THE NEW CREATURE WHO IS PATIENT AND HUMBLE AND GENTLE AND UNSELFISH
0925-8141-0040 AND THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO GET IT THERE IS NO MYSTERY ABOUT IT WE LOVE OTHERS WE LOVE EVERYBODY WE LOVE OUR ENEMIES
0925-8157-0000 THERE IS STILL ONE DOUBT TO CLEAR UP AFTER THE STATEMENT LEARN OF ME CHRIST THROWS IN THE DISCONCERTING QUALIFICATION TAKE MY YOKE UPON YOU AND LEARN OF ME
0925-8157-0001 WHY IF ALL THIS BE TRUE DOES HE CALL IT A YOKE
0925-8157-0002 BURDEN IS THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AFTER ALL WHAT ITS ENEMIES TAKE IT FOR AN ADDITIONAL WEIGHT TO THE ALREADY GREAT WOE OF LIFE SOME EXTRA PUNCTILIOUSNESS ABOUT DUTY
0925-8157-0003 SOME PAINFUL DEVOTION TO OBSERVANCES SOME HEAVY RESTRICTION AND TRAMMELING OF ALL THAT IS JOYOUS AND FREE IN THE WORLD
0925-8157-0004 IS LIFE NOT HARD AND SORROWFUL ENOUGH WITHOUT BEING FETTERED WITH YET ANOTHER YOKE IT IS ASTOUNDING HOW SO GLARING A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THIS PLAIN SENTENCE
0925-8157-0005 SHOULD EVER HAVE PASSED INTO CURRENCY DID YOU EVER STOP TO ASK WHAT A YOKE IS REALLY FOR IS IT TO BE A BURDEN TO THE ANIMAL WHICH WEARS IT
0925-8157-0006 IT IS JUST THE OPPOSITE IT IS TO MAKE ITS BURDEN LIGHT
0925-8157-0007 THE PLOUGH WOULD BE INTOLERABLE WORKED BY MEANS OF A YOKE IT IS LIGHT A YOKE IS NOT AN INSTRUMENT OF TORTURE IT IS AN INSTRUMENT OF MERCY
0925-8157-0008 IT IS NOT A MALICIOUS CONTRIVANCE FOR MAKING WORK HARD IT IS A GENTLE DEVICE TO MAKE HARD LABOR LIGHT IT IS NOT MEANT TO GIVE PAIN BUT TO SAVE PAIN
0925-8157-0009 SOME DELIGHTING IN PORTRAYING ITS NARROW EXACTIONS SOME SEEKING IN THESE EXACTIONS THE MARKS OF ITS DIVINITY OTHERS APOLOGIZING FOR IT AND TONING IT DOWN
0925-8157-0010 HAS THIS ONE MISTAKEN PHRASE DRIVEN FOREVER AWAY FROM THE KINGDOM OF GOD INSTEAD OF MAKING CHRIST ATTRACTIVE IT MAKES HIM OUT A TASKMASTER
0925-8157-0011 NARROWING LIFE BY PETTY RESTRICTIONS CALLING FOR SELF DENIAL WHERE NONE IS NECESSARY MAKING MISERY A VIRTUE UNDER THE PLEA THAT IT IS THE YOKE OF CHRIST AND HAPPINESS CRIMINAL
0925-8157-0012 ACCORDING TO THIS CONCEPTION CHRISTIANS ARE AT BEST THE VICTIMS OF A DEPRESSING FATE THEIR LIFE IS A PENANCE AND THEIR HOPE FOR THE NEXT WORLD PURCHASED BY A SLOW MARTYRDOM IN THIS
0925-8157-0013 HE KNEW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SMOOTH YOKE AND A ROUGH ONE A BAD FIT AND A GOOD FIT THE DIFFERENCE ALSO IT MADE TO THE PATIENT ANIMAL WHICH HAD TO WEAR IT
0925-8157-0014 THE ROUGH YOKE GALLED AND THE BURDEN WAS HEAVY THE SMOOTH YOKE CAUSED NO PAIN AND THE LOAD WAS LIGHTLY DRAWN THE BADLY FITTED HARNESS WAS A MISERY
0925-8157-0015 THE WELL FITTED COLLAR WAS EASY AND WHAT WAS THE BURDEN IT WAS NOT SOME SPECIAL BURDEN LAID UPON THE CHRISTIAN SOME UNIQUE INFLICTION
0925-8157-0016 CHRIST SAW THAT MEN TOOK LIFE PAINFULLY TO SOME IT WAS A WEARINESS TO OTHERS A FAILURE TO MANY A TRAGEDY TO ALL A STRUGGLE AND A PAIN
0925-8157-0017 HOW TO CARRY THIS BURDEN OF LIFE HAD BEEN THE WHOLE WORLD'S PROBLEM IT IS STILL THE WHOLE WORLD'S PROBLEM AND HERE IS CHRIST'S SOLUTION
0925-8157-0018 AND LEARN OF ME AND YOU WILL FIND IT EASY FOR MY YOKE IS EASY WORKS EASILY
0925-8157-0019 AND THEREFORE MY BURDEN IS LIGHT THERE IS NO SUGGESTION HERE THAT RELIGION WILL ABSOLVE ANY MAN FROM BEARING BURDENS
0925-8157-0020 THAT WOULD BE TO ABSOLVE HIM FROM LIVING SINCE IT IS LIFE ITSELF THAT IS THE BURDEN WHAT CHRISTIANITY DOES PROPOSE IS TO MAKE IT TOLERABLE CHRIST'S YOKE IS SIMPLY
0925-8157-0021 HIS SECRET FOR THE ALLEVIATION OF HUMAN LIFE HIS PRESCRIPTION FOR THE BEST AND HAPPIEST METHOD OF LIVING MEN HARNESS THEMSELVES TO THE WORK AND STRESS OF THE WORLD
0925-8157-0022 IN CLUMSY AND UNNATURAL WAYS THE HARNESS THEY PUT ON IS ANTIQUATED
0925-8157-0023 THEY MAKE ITS STRAIN AND FRICTION PAST ENDURING BY PLACING IT WHERE THE NECK IS MOST SENSITIVE AND BY MERE CONTINUOUS IRRITATION THIS SENSITIVENESS INCREASES UNTIL THE WHOLE NATURE
0925-8157-0024 IS QUICK AND SORE THIS IS THE ORIGIN AMONG OTHER THINGS OF A DISEASE CALLED TOUCHINESS A DISEASE WHICH IN SPITE OF ITS INNOCENT NAME
0925-8157-0025 INFLAMED TO THE ACUTE POINT CONCEIT WITH A HAIR TRIGGER THE CURE IS TO SHIFT THE YOKE TO SOME OTHER PLACE TO LET MEN AND THINGS TOUCH US THROUGH SOME NEW
0925-8157-0026 AND PERHAPS AS YET UNUSED PART OF OUR NATURE TO BECOME MEEK AND LOWLY IN HEART
0925-8157-0027 IS BECOMING NUMB FROM WANT OF USE IT IS THE BEAUTIFUL WORK OF CHRISTIANITY EVERYWHERE TO ADJUST THE BURDEN OF LIFE TO THOSE WHO BEAR IT AND THEM TO IT
0925-8157-0028 IT HAS A PERFECTLY MIRACULOUS GIFT OF HEALING WITHOUT DOING ANY VIOLENCE TO HUMAN NATURE IT SETS IT RIGHT WITH LIFE HARMONIZING IT WITH ALL SURROUNDING THINGS
0925-8157-0029 AND RESTORING THOSE WHO ARE JADED WITH THE FATIGUE AND DUST OF THE WORLD TO A NEW GRACE OF LIVING IN THE MERE MATTER OF ALTERING THE PERSPECTIVE OF LIFE
0925-8157-0030 AND CHANGING THE PROPORTIONS OF THINGS ITS FUNCTION IN LIGHTENING THE CARE OF MAN IS ALTOGETHER ITS OWN THE WEIGHT OF A LOAD DEPENDS UPON THE ATTRACTION OF THE EARTH
0925-8157-0032 IN WHICH IT DIMINISHES MAN'S BURDEN IT MAKES THEM CITIZENS OF ANOTHER WORLD WHAT WAS A TON YESTERDAY IS NOT HALF A TON TODAY
0925-8157-0033 SO WITHOUT CHANGING ONE'S CIRCUMSTANCES MERELY BY OFFERING A WIDER HORIZON AND A DIFFERENT STANDARD IT ALTERS THE WHOLE ASPECT OF THE WORLD
0925-8157-0034 IS THE TRUEST PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE EVER SPOKEN BUT LET US BE QUITE SURE WHEN WE SPEAK OF CHRISTIANITY THAT WE MEAN CHRIST'S CHRISTIANITY OTHER VERSIONS ARE EITHER CARICATURES
0925-8157-0035 OR EXAGGERATIONS OR MISUNDERSTANDINGS OR SHORTSIGHTED AND SURFACE READINGS FOR THE MOST PART THEIR ATTAINMENT IS HOPELESS AND THE RESULTS WRETCHED
0925-8157-0036 BUT I CARE NOT WHO THE PERSON IS OR THROUGH WHAT VALE OF TEARS HE HAS PASSED OR IS ABOUT TO PASS
0948-132705-0000 IT IS DARK HERE IN THE FOREST THE LEAVES RUSTLE OVER OUR HEAD BLACK AGAINST THE LAST GOLD OF THE SKY THE MOSS IS SOFT AND WARM WE SHALL SLEEP ON THIS MOSS FOR MANY NIGHTS
0948-132705-0001 TILL THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST COME TO TEAR OUR BODY WE HAVE NO BED NOW SAVE THE MOSS AND NO FUTURE SAVE THE BEASTS WE ARE OLD NOW YET WE WERE YOUNG THIS MORNING
0948-132705-0002 WHEN WE CARRIED OUR GLASS BOX THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CITY TO THE HOME OF THE SCHOLARS NO MEN STOPPED US
0948-132705-0003 THEY WERE AS SHAPELESS CLOUDS HUDDLED AT THE RISE OF THE GREAT SKY
0948-132705-0004 AND OTHERS FROM DISTANT LANDS WHOSE NAMES WE HAD NOT HEARD WE SAW A GREAT PAINTING ON THE WALL OVER THEIR HEADS OF THE TWENTY ILLUSTRIOUS MEN WHO HAD INVENTED THE CANDLE ALL THE HEADS OF THE COUNCIL TURNED TO US AS WE ENTERED
0948-132705-0005 THESE GREAT AND WISE OF THE EARTH DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF US
0948-132705-0006 AS IF WE WERE A MIRACLE IT IS TRUE THAT OUR TUNIC WAS TORN AND STAINED WITH BROWN STAINS WHICH HAD BEEN BLOOD WE RAISED OUR RIGHT ARM AND WE SAID OUR GREETING TO YOU OUR HONORED BROTHERS OF THE WORLD COUNCIL OF SCHOLARS
0948-132705-0007 WHO ARE YOU OUR BROTHER FOR YOU DO NOT LOOK LIKE A SCHOLAR
0948-132705-0008 THEN IT WAS AS IF A GREAT WIND HAD STRICKEN THE HALL FOR ALL THE SCHOLARS SPOKE AT ONCE AND THEY WERE ANGRY AND FRIGHTENED A STREET SWEEPER
0948-132705-0009 A STREET SWEEPER WALKING IN UPON THE WORLD COUNCIL OF SCHOLARS IT IS NOT TO BE BELIEVED IT IS AGAINST ALL THE RULES AND ALL THE LAWS BUT WE KNEW HOW TO STOP THEM OUR BROTHERS WE SAID
0948-132705-0010 WE MATTER NOT NOR OUR TRANSGRESSION IT IS ONLY OUR BROTHER MEN WHO MATTER GIVE NO THOUGHT TO US FOR WE ARE NOTHING BUT LISTEN TO OUR WORDS FOR WE BRING YOU A GIFT SUCH
0948-132705-0011 LISTEN TO US FOR WE HOLD THE FUTURE OF MANKIND IN OUR HANDS THEN THEY LISTENED WE PLACED OUR
0948-132705-0012 AND THEY ALL BENT FORWARD AND SAT STILL WATCHING AND WE STOOD STILL OUR EYES UPON THE WIRE AND SLOWLY SLOWLY AS A FLUSH OF BLOOD A RED FLAME TREMBLED IN THE WIRE THEN THE WIRE GLOWED
0948-132705-0013 BUT TERROR STRUCK THE MEN OF THE COUNCIL
0948-132705-0014 WE LOOKED UPON THEM AND WE LAUGHED AND SAID FEAR NOTHING OUR BROTHERS THERE IS A GREAT POWER IN THESE WIRES BUT THIS POWER IS TAMED IT IS YOURS WE GIVE IT TO YOU STILL THEY WOULD NOT MOVE
0948-132705-0015 WE CRIED WE GIVE YOU THE KEY TO THE EARTH TAKE IT AND LET US BE ONE OF YOU THE HUMBLEST AMONG YOU
0948-132705-0016 AND MAKE IT EASE THE TOIL OF MEN LET US THROW AWAY OUR CANDLES AND OUR TORCHES LET US FLOOD OUR CITIES WITH LIGHT LET US BRING A NEW LIGHT TO MEN BUT THEY LOOKED UPON US AND SUDDENLY WE WERE AFRAID
0948-132705-0017 FOR THEIR EYES WERE STILL AND SMALL AND EVIL OUR BROTHERS WE CRIED HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SAY TO US
0948-132705-0018 NINE MOVED FORWARD THEY MOVED TO THE TABLE AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED YES SPOKE COLLECTIVE ZERO
0948-132705-0019 WE HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO YOU THE SOUND OF THEIR VOICES BROUGHT SILENCE TO THE HALL AND TO BEAT OF OUR HEART
0948-132705-0020 WE HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO A WRETCH WHO HAVE BROKEN ALL THE LAWS AND WHO BOAST OF THEIR INFAMY HOW DARED YOU THINK THAT YOUR MIND HELD GREATER WISDOM THAN THE MINDS OF YOUR BROTHERS
0948-132705-0021 YOU SHALL BE BURNED AT THE STAKE SAID DEMOCRACY FOUR SIXTY NINE NINETY EIGHT NO
0948-132705-0022 SEVEN THIRTY THREE O FOUR TILL THERE IS NOTHING LEFT UNDER THE LASHES NO SAID COLLECTIVE ZERO
0948-132705-0023 WE CANNOT DECIDE UPON THIS OUR BROTHERS NO SUCH CRIME HAS EVER BEEN COMMITTED AND IT IS NOT FOR US TO JUDGE NOR FOR ANY SMALL COUNCIL WE SHALL DELIVER THIS CREATURE TO THE WORLD COUNCIL ITSELF
0948-132705-0024 LET THE WILL OF THE COUNCIL BE DONE UPON OUR BODY WE DO NOT CARE BUT THE LIGHT WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE LIGHT
0948-132705-0025 NO WE ANSWERED WHAT IS NOT THOUGHT BY ALL MEN CANNOT BE TRUE SAID COLLECTIVE ZERO
0948-132705-0026 YOU HAVE WORKED ON THIS ALONE
0948-132705-0027 MANY MEN IN THE HOMES OF THE SCHOLARS HAVE HAD STRANGE NEW IDEAS IN THE PAST
0948-132705-0028 BUT WHEN THE MAJORITY OF THEIR BROTHER SCHOLARS VOTED AGAINST THEM THEY ABANDONED THEIR IDEAS AS ALL MEN MUST THIS BOX IS USELESS SAID ALLIANCE SIX SEVENTY THREE FORTY NINE
0948-132705-0029 SHOULD IT BE WHAT THEY CLAIM OF IT SAID HARMONY NINE
0948-132705-0030 THEN IT WOULD BRING RUIN TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CANDLES THE CANDLE IS A GREAT BOON TO MANKIND AS APPROVED BY ALL MEN
0948-132705-0031 AND TO DECIDE UPON THE NUMBER NEEDED AND TO RE FIT THE PLANS SO AS TO MAKE CANDLES INSTEAD OF TORCHES THIS TOUCHED UPON THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MEN WORKING IN SCORES OF STATES WE CANNOT ALTER THE PLANS AGAIN SO SOON
0948-132705-0032 THEN IT IS A GREAT EVIL FOR MEN HAVE NO CAUSE TO EXIST SAVE IN TOILING FOR OTHER MEN
0948-132705-0033 NINE ROSE AND POINTED AT OUR BOX THIS THING THEY SAID MUST BE DESTROYED AND ALL THE OTHERS CRIED AS ONE
0948-132705-0034 IT MUST BE DESTROYED THEN WE LEAPT TO THE TABLE WE SEIZED OUR BOX WE SHOVED THEM ASIDE AND WE RAN TO THE WINDOW WE TURNED AND WE LOOKED AT THEM FOR THE LAST TIME AND A RAGE
0948-132705-0035 DAMNED FOOLS WE SWUNG OUR FIST THROUGH THE WINDOWPANE AND WE LEAPT OUT IN A RINGING RAIN OF GLASS WE FELL BUT WE NEVER LET THE BOX FALL FROM OUR HANDS
0948-132705-0036 THEN WE RAN WE RAN BLINDLY AND MEN AND HOUSES STREAKED PAST US IN A TORRENT WITHOUT SHAPE AND THE ROAD SEEMED NOT TO BE FLAT BEFORE US BUT AS IF IT WERE LEAPING UP TO MEET US AND WE WAITED FOR THE EARTH
0948-132705-0037 TO RISE AND STRIKE US IN THE FACE BUT WE RAN WE KNEW NOT WHERE WE WERE GOING WE KNEW ONLY THAT WE MUST RUN RUN TO THE END OF THE WORLD TO THE END OF OUR DAYS
0948-132705-0038 THEN WE KNEW SUDDENLY THAT WE WERE LYING ON A SOFT EARTH AND THAT WE HAD STOPPED
0948-132705-0039 THEN WE KNEW WE WERE IN THE UNCHARTED FOREST WE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF COMING HERE BUT OUR LEGS HAD CARRIED OUR WISDOM AND OUR LEGS HAD BROUGHT US TO THE UNCHARTED FOREST AGAINST OUR WILL
0948-132705-0040 OUR GLASS BOX LAY BESIDE US WE CRAWLED TO IT WE FELL UPON IT OUR FACE IN OUR ARMS AND WE LAY STILL WE LAY
0948-132705-0041 THEN WE ROSE WE TOOK OUR BOX AND WALKED ON INTO THE FOREST IT MATTERED NOT WHERE WE WENT WE KNEW THAT MEN WOULD NOT FOLLOW US FOR THEY NEVER ENTER THE UNCHARTED FOREST
0948-132705-0042 SO WE WALKED ON OUR BOX IN OUR ARMS OUR HEART EMPTY WE ARE DOOMED WHATEVER DAYS ARE LEFT TO US WE SHALL SPEND THEM ALONE
0948-132705-0043 AND WE HAVE HEARD OF THE CORRUPTION TO BE FOUND IN SOLITUDE WE HAVE TORN OURSELVES FROM THE TRUTH WHICH IS OUR BROTHER MEN AND THERE IS NO ROAD BACK FOR US AND NO REDEMPTION WE KNOW THESE THINGS
0948-132705-0044 BUT WE DO NOT CARE WE CARE FOR NOTHING ON EARTH WE ARE TIRED ONLY THE GLASS BOX IN OUR ARMS IS LIKE A LIVING HEART THAT GIVES US STRENGTH WE HAVE LIED TO OURSELVES
0948-132705-0045 WE HAVE NOT BUILT THIS BOX FOR THE GOOD OF OUR BROTHERS WE BUILT IT FOR ITS OWN SAKE IT IS ABOVE ALL OUR BROTHERS TO US
0948-132705-0046 ABOVE THEIR TRUTH WHY WONDER ABOUT THIS WE HAVE NOT MANY DAYS TO LIVE WE ARE WALKING TO THE FANGS AWAITING US SOMEWHERE AMONG THE GREAT SILENT TREES
0948-132705-0047 THERE IS NOT A THING BEHIND US TO REGRET THEN A BLOW OF PAIN STRUCK US OUR FIRST AND OUR ONLY WE THOUGHT OF THE GOLDEN ONE
0948-132705-0048 WE THOUGHT OF THE GOLDEN ONE WHOM WE SHALL NEVER SEE AGAIN THEN THE PAIN PASSED IT IS BEST
0948-132707-0000 WE HAVE NOT WRITTEN FOR MANY DAYS WE DID NOT WISH TO SPEAK FOR WE NEEDED NO WORDS TO REMEMBER THAT WHICH HAS HAPPENED TO US
0948-132707-0001 WE HID IN THE BUSHES AND WE WAITED THE STEPS CAME CLOSER AND THEN WE SAW THE FOLD OF A WHITE TUNIC AMONG THE TREES AND A GLEAM OF GOLD WE LEAPT FORWARD WE RAN TO THEM
0948-132707-0002 AND WE STOOD LOOKING UPON THE GOLDEN ONE THEY SAW US AND THEIR HANDS CLOSED INTO FISTS AND THE FISTS PULLED THEIR ARMS DOWN AS IF THEY WISHED THEIR ARMS TO HOLD THEM
0948-132707-0003 WHILE THEIR BODY SWAYED AND THEY COULD NOT SPEAK WE DARED NOT COME TOO CLOSE TO THEM WE ASKED AND OUR VOICE TREMBLED
0948-132707-0004 WE ASKED THEY RAISED THEIR HEAD AND THERE WAS A GREAT PRIDE IN THEIR VOICE THEY ANSWERED WE HAVE FOLLOWED YOU THEN WE COULD NOT SPEAK
0948-132707-0005 AND THEY SAID WE HEARD THAT YOU HAD GONE TO THE UNCHARTED FOREST FOR THE WHOLE CITY IS SPEAKING OF IT SO ON THE NIGHT OF THE DAY WHEN WE HEARD IT WE RAN AWAY FROM THE HOME OF THE PEASANTS
0948-132707-0006 WE FOUND THE MARKS OF YOUR FEET ACROSS THE PLAIN WHERE NO MEN WALK SO WE FOLLOWED THEM AND WE WENT INTO THE FOREST AND WE FOLLOWED THE PATH WHERE THE BRANCHES WERE BROKEN BY YOUR BODY
0948-132707-0007 THEIR WHITE TUNIC WAS TORN AND THE BRANCHES HAD CUT THE SKIN OF THEIR ARMS BUT THEY SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD NEVER TAKEN NOTICE OF IT NOR OF WEARINESS NOR OF FEAR
0948-132707-0008 WE HAVE FOLLOWED YOU THEY SAID AND WE SHALL FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU GO IF DANGER THREATENS YOU WE SHALL FACE IT ALSO IF IT BE DEATH WE SHALL DIE WITH YOU
0948-132707-0009 YOUR EYES ARE AS A FLAME BUT OUR BROTHERS HAVE NEITHER HOPE NOR FIRE YOUR MOUTH IS CUT OF GRANITE BUT OUR BROTHERS ARE SOFT AND HUMBLE YOUR HEAD IS HIGH BUT OUR BROTHERS CRINGE
0948-132707-0010 YOU WALK BUT OUR BROTHERS CRAWL WE WISH TO BE DAMNED WITH YOU RATHER THAN
0948-132707-0011 DO AS YOU PLEASE WITH US BUT DO NOT SEND US AWAY FROM YOU THEN THEY KNELT AND BOWED THEIR GOLDEN HEAD BEFORE US
0948-132707-0012 WE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT WHICH WE DID WE BENT TO RAISE THE GOLDEN ONE TO THEIR FEET BUT WHEN WE TOUCHED THEM IT WAS AS IF MADNESS HAD STRICKEN US
0948-132707-0013 WE SEIZED THEIR BODY AND WE PRESSED OUR LIPS TO THEIRS THE GOLDEN ONE BREATHED ONCE AND THEIR BREATH WAS A MOAN AND THEN THEIR ARMS CLOSED AROUND US WE STOOD TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME
0948-132707-0014 AND WE WERE FRIGHTENED THAT WE HAD LIVED FOR
0948-132707-0015 AND HAD NEVER KNOWN WHAT JOY IS POSSIBLE TO MEN THEN WE SAID OUR DEAREST ONE FEAR NOTHING OF THE FOREST THERE IS NO DANGER IN SOLITUDE
0948-132707-0016 WE HAVE NO NEED OF OUR BROTHERS LET US FORGET THEIR GOOD AND OUR EVIL LET US FORGET ALL THINGS SAVE THAT WE ARE TOGETHER
0948-132707-0017 GIVE US YOUR HAND LOOK AHEAD IT IS OUR OWN WORLD GOLDEN ONE A STRANGE UNKNOWN WORLD BUT OUR OWN THEN WE WALKED ON INTO THE FOREST
0948-132707-0018 THEIR HAND IN OURS AND THAT NIGHT WE KNEW THAT TO HOLD THE BODY OF WOMEN IN OUR ARMS IS NEITHER UGLY NOR SHAMEFUL BUT THE ONE ECSTASY GRANTED TO THE RACE OF MEN
0948-132707-0019 WE HAVE WALKED FOR MANY DAYS THE FOREST HAS NO END AND WE SEEK NO END BUT EACH DAY ADDED TO THE CHAIN OF DAYS BETWEEN US AND THE CITY IS LIKE AN ADDED BLESSING
0948-132707-0020 WE HAVE MADE A BOW AND MANY ARROWS WE CAN KILL MORE BIRDS THAN WE NEED FOR OUR FOOD WE FIND WATER AND FRUIT IN THE FOREST AT NIGHT WE CHOOSE A CLEARING AND WE BUILD A RING OF FIRES AROUND IT
0948-132707-0021 AS A CROWN OF JEWELS AROUND US AND SMOKE STANDS STILL IN THE AIR IN COLUMNS MADE BLUE BY THE MOONLIGHT WE SLEEP TOGETHER IN THE MIDST OF THE RING THE ARMS OF THE GOLDEN ONE AROUND US
0948-132707-0022 THEIR HEAD UPON OUR BREAST SOME DAY WE SHALL STOP AND BUILD A HOUSE WHEN WE SHALL HAVE GONE FAR ENOUGH BUT WE DO NOT HAVE TO HASTEN
0948-132707-0023 THE DAYS BEFORE US ARE WITHOUT END LIKE THE FOREST WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND THIS NEW LIFE WHICH WE HAVE FOUND YET IT SEEMS SO CLEAR AND SO SIMPLE WHEN QUESTIONS COME TO PUZZLE US WE WALK FASTER
0948-132707-0024 THEN TURN AND FORGET ALL THINGS AS WE WATCH THE GOLDEN ONE FOLLOWING THE SHADOWS OF LEAVES FALL UPON THEIR ARMS AS THEY SPREAD THE BRANCHES APART BUT THEIR SHOULDERS ARE IN THE SUN
0948-132707-0025 THE SKIN OF THEIR ARMS IS LIKE A BLUE MIST BUT THEIR SHOULDERS ARE WHITE AND GLOWING AS IF THE LIGHT FELL NOT FROM ABOVE BUT ROSE FROM UNDER THEIR SKIN WE WATCH THE LEAF WHICH HAS FALLEN
0948-132707-0026 UPON THEIR SHOULDER AND IT LIES AT THE CURVE OF THEIR NECK AND A DROP OF DEW GLISTENS UPON IT LIKE A JEWEL THEY APPROACH US AND THEY STOP LAUGHING KNOWING WHAT WE THINK
0948-132707-0027 AND THEY WAIT OBEDIENTLY WITHOUT QUESTIONS TILL IT PLEASES US TO TURN AND GO ON WE GO ON AND WE BLESS THE EARTH UNDER OUR FEET BUT QUESTIONS COME TO US AGAIN AS WE WALK IN SILENCE
0948-132707-0028 THEN WHAT CAN MEN WISH FOR SAVE CORRUPTION IF THIS IS THE GREAT EVIL OF BEING ALONE THEN WHAT IS GOOD AND WHAT IS EVIL EVERYTHING WHICH COMES FROM THE MANY IS GOOD
0948-132707-0029 EVERYTHING WHICH COMES FROM ONE IS EVIL
0948-132707-0030 WITH OUR FIRST BREATH WE HAVE BROKEN THE LAW BUT WE HAVE NEVER DOUBTED IT YET NOW
0948-132707-0031 BUT WE LIVED NOT WHEN WE TOILED FOR OUR BROTHERS WE WERE ONLY WEARY THERE IS NO JOY FOR MEN SAVE THE JOY SHARED WITH ALL THEIR BROTHERS BUT THE ONLY THINGS WHICH TAUGHT US JOY
0948-132707-0032 AND THE GOLDEN ONE AND BOTH THESE JOYS BELONG TO US ALONE
0948-132707-0033 AND THEY DO NOT CONCERN OUR BROTHERS IN ANY WAY THUS DO WE WONDER THERE IS SOME ERROR ONE FRIGHTFUL ERROR IN THE THINKING OF MEN WHAT IS THAT ERROR WE DO NOT KNOW
0948-132707-0034 BUT THE KNOWLEDGE STRUGGLES WITHIN US STRUGGLES TO BE BORN TODAY THE GOLDEN ONE STOPPED SUDDENLY AND SAID WE LOVE YOU
0948-132707-0035 NO THEY WHISPERED THAT IS NOT WHAT WE WISHED TO SAY THEY WERE SILENT THEN THEY SPOKE SLOWLY AND THEIR WORDS WERE HALTING LIKE THE WORDS OF A CHILD LEARNING TO SPEAK FOR THE FIRST TIME
0948-132707-0036 WE ARE ONE ALONE AND ONLY AND WE LOVE YOU WHO ARE ONE ALONE AND ONLY WE LOOKED INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
0948-132710-0000 THE BOOK FELL FROM MY HANDS AND I WEPT I WHO HAD NEVER KNOWN TEARS I WEPT IN DELIVERANCE AND IN PITY FOR ALL MANKIND
0948-132710-0002 AND MY TRANSGRESSIONS AND WHY I HAD NEVER FELT GUILT IN MY SINS I UNDERSTOOD THAT CENTURIES OF CHAINS AND LASHES WILL NOT KILL THE SPIRIT OF MAN NOR THE SENSE OF TRUTH WITHIN HIM
0948-132710-0003 I READ MANY BOOKS FOR MANY DAYS THEN I CALLED THE GOLDEN ONE AND I TOLD HER WHAT I HAD READ AND WHAT I HAD LEARNED SHE LOOKED AT ME AND THE FIRST WORDS SHE SPOKE WERE I LOVE YOU
0948-132710-0004 I HAVE READ OF A MAN WHO LIVED MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO AND OF ALL THE NAMES IN THESE BOOKS HIS IS THE ONE I WISH TO BEAR
0948-132710-0005 AND I HAVE READ OF A GODDESS I SAID WHO WAS THE MOTHER OF THE EARTH AND OF ALL THE GODS HER NAME WAS GAEA LET THIS BE YOUR NAME MY GOLDEN ONE FOR YOU ARE TO BE THE MOTHER OF A NEW KIND OF GODS
0948-132710-0006 AS THE HEIR OF ALL THE SAINTS AND ALL THE MARTYRS WHO CAME BEFORE HIM AND WHO DIED FOR THE SAME CAUSE FOR THE SAME WORD NO MATTER WHAT NAME THEY GAVE TO THEIR CAUSE AND THEIR TRUTH
0948-132710-0007 I SHALL LIVE HERE IN MY OWN HOUSE I SHALL TAKE MY FOOD FROM THE EARTH BY THE TOIL OF MY OWN HANDS I SHALL LEARN MANY SECRETS FROM MY BOOKS THROUGH THE YEARS AHEAD I SHALL REBUILD THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PAST
0948-132710-0008 AND OPEN THE WAY TO CARRY THEM FURTHER THE ACHIEVEMENTS WHICH ARE OPEN TO ME BUT CLOSED FOREVER TO MY BROTHERS FOR THEIR MINDS ARE SHACKLED TO THE WEAKEST
0948-132710-0009 THEY CALLED IT ELECTRICITY IT WAS THE POWER THAT MOVED THEIR GREATEST INVENTIONS
0948-132710-0010 I HAVE FOUND THE ENGINE WHICH PRODUCED THIS LIGHT I SHALL LEARN HOW TO REPAIR IT AND HOW TO MAKE IT WORK AGAIN I SHALL LEARN HOW TO USE THE WIRES WHICH CARRY THIS POWER THEN I SHALL BUILD A BARRIER OF WIRES AROUND MY HOME
0948-132710-0011 AND ACROSS THE PATHS WHICH LEAD TO MY HOME A BARRIER LIGHT AS A COBWEB MORE IMPASSABLE THAN A WALL OF GRANITE A BARRIER MY BROTHERS WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CROSS
0948-132710-0012 WHEN I SHALL HAVE READ ALL THE BOOKS AND LEARNED MY NEW WAY WHEN MY HOME WILL BE READY AND MY EARTH TILLED I SHALL STEAL ONE DAY FOR THE LAST TIME
0948-132710-0013 WHO HAS NO NAME SAVE INTERNATIONAL
0948-132710-0014 AND ALL THOSE LIKE HIM FRATERNITY
0948-132710-0015 WHO CRIES WITHOUT REASON AND SOLIDARITY
0948-132710-0016 WHO CALLS FOR HELP IN THE NIGHT AND A FEW OTHERS I SHALL CALL TO ME
0948-132710-0017 HAS NOT BEEN KILLED WITHIN THEM AND WHO SUFFER UNDER THE YOKE OF THEIR BROTHERS THEY WILL FOLLOW ME AND I SHALL LEAD THEM TO MY FORTRESS AND HERE IN THIS UNCHARTED WILDERNESS I
0948-132710-0018 AND THEY MY CHOSEN FRIENDS MY FELLOW BUILDERS SHALL WRITE THE FIRST CHAPTER IN THE NEW HISTORY OF MAN
0948-132710-0019 AND AS I STAND HERE AT THE DOOR OF GLORY I LOOK BEHIND ME FOR THE LAST TIME I LOOK UPON THE HISTORY OF MEN WHICH I HAVE LEARNED FROM THE BOOKS AND I WONDER IT WAS A LONG STORY
0948-132710-0020 AND THE SPIRIT WHICH MOVED IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF MAN'S FREEDOM BUT WHAT IS FREEDOM FREEDOM FROM WHAT THERE IS NOTHING TO TAKE A MAN'S FREEDOM AWAY FROM HIM SAVE OTHER MEN
0948-132710-0021 HE DECLARED TO ALL HIS BROTHERS THAT A MAN HAS RIGHTS WHICH NEITHER GOD NOR KING NOR OTHER MEN CAN TAKE AWAY FROM HIM NO MATTER WHAT THEIR NUMBER
0948-132710-0022 IS THE RIGHT OF MAN AND THERE IS NO RIGHT ON EARTH ABOVE THIS RIGHT
0948-132710-0023 BUT THEN HE GAVE UP ALL HE HAD WON AND FELL LOWER THAN HIS SAVAGE BEGINNING WHAT BROUGHT IT TO PASS WHAT DISASTER
0948-132710-0024 TOOK THEIR REASON AWAY FROM MEN WHAT WHIP LASHED THEM TO THEIR KNEES IN SHAME AND SUBMISSION THE WORSHIP OF THE WORD WE WHEN MEN ACCEPTED THAT WORSHIP
0948-132710-0025 THE STRUCTURE OF CENTURIES COLLAPSED ABOUT THEM THE STRUCTURE WHOSE EVERY BEAM HAD COME FROM THE THOUGHT OF SOME ONE MAN EACH IN HIS DAY DOWN THE AGES FROM THE DEPTH OF SOME ONE SPIRIT
0948-132710-0026 BUT FOR ITS OWN SAKE THOSE MEN WHO SURVIVED THOSE EAGER TO OBEY EAGER TO LIVE FOR ONE ANOTHER SINCE THEY HAD NOTHING ELSE TO VINDICATE THEM THOSE MEN COULD NEITHER CARRY ON NOR PRESERVE WHAT THEY HAD RECEIVED
0948-132710-0027 THUS DID ALL THOUGHT ALL SCIENCE ALL WISDOM PERISH ON EARTH THUS DID MEN
0948-132710-0028 THE STEEL TOWERS THE FLYING SHIPS THE POWER WIRES ALL THE THINGS THEY
0948-132710-0029 PERHAPS LATER SOME MEN HAD BEEN BORN WITH THE MIND AND THE COURAGE TO RECOVER THESE THINGS WHICH WERE LOST
0948-132710-0030 AND FOR THE SAME REASONS BUT I STILL WONDER HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE IN THOSE GRACELESS YEARS OF TRANSITION LONG AGO THAT MEN DID NOT SEE WHITHER THEY WERE GOING AND WENT ON
0948-132710-0031 IN BLINDNESS AND COWARDICE TO THEIR FATE I WONDER FOR IT IS HARD FOR ME TO CONCEIVE HOW MEN WHO KNEW THE WORD I COULD GIVE IT UP
0948-132710-0032 BUT SUCH HAS BEEN THE STORY
0948-132710-0033 WHAT AGONY MUST HAVE BEEN THEIRS BEFORE THAT WHICH THEY SAW COMING AND COULD NOT STOP PERHAPS THEY CRIED OUT IN PROTEST AND IN WARNING BUT MEN PAID NO HEED TO THEIR WARNING AND THEY
0948-132710-0034 FOUGHT A HOPELESS BATTLE AND THEY PERISHED WITH THEIR BANNERS SMEARED BY THEIR OWN BLOOD AND THEY CHOSE TO PERISH FOR THEY KNEW TO THEM I SEND MY SALUTE ACROSS THE CENTURIES AND MY PITY
0948-132710-0035 THAT THE DESPAIR OF THEIR HEARTS WAS NOT TO BE FINAL AND THEIR NIGHT WAS NOT WITHOUT HOPE FOR THE BATTLE THEY LOST CAN NEVER BE LOST FOR THAT WHICH THEY DIED TO SAVE
0948-132710-0036 CAN NEVER PERISH THROUGH ALL THE DARKNESS THROUGH ALL THE SHAME OF WHICH MEN ARE CAPABLE THE SPIRIT OF MAN WILL REMAIN ALIVE ON THIS EARTH IT MAY SLEEP BUT IT WILL AWAKEN
0948-132710-0037 IT MAY WEAR CHAINS BUT IT WILL BREAK THROUGH AND MAN WILL GO ON MAN NOT MEN HERE ON THIS MOUNTAIN
0948-132710-0038 I AND MY SONS AND MY CHOSEN FRIENDS SHALL BUILD OUR NEW LAND AND OUR FORT AND IT WILL BECOME AS THE HEART OF THE EARTH LOST AND HIDDEN AT FIRST BUT BEATING
0948-132710-0039 BEATING LOUDER EACH DAY AND WORD OF IT WILL REACH EVERY CORNER OF THE EARTH AND THE ROADS OF THE WORLD WILL BECOME AS VEINS WHICH WILL CARRY THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S BLOOD TO MY THRESHOLD
0948-132710-0040 AND ALL MY BROTHERS AND THE COUNCILS OF MY BROTHERS WILL HEAR OF IT BUT THEY WILL BE IMPOTENT AGAINST ME AND THE DAY WILL COME
0948-132710-0041 AND MY HOME WILL BECOME THE CAPITAL OF A WORLD WHERE EACH MAN WILL BE FREE TO EXIST FOR HIS OWN SAKE
0948-132710-0042 THE WORD WHICH CAN NEVER DIE ON THIS EARTH FOR IT IS THE HEART OF IT AND THE MEANING AND THE GLORY
0949-134657-0000 OR EVEN TO SEAT THEMSELVES ON HIS VACANT THRONE THE PHILOSOPHER COULD EXCUSE THE HASTY SALLIES OF DISCONTENT AND THE HERO COULD DESPISE THE AMBITIOUS PROJECTS WHICH SURPASSED THE FORTUNE OR THE ABILITIES OF THE RASH CONSPIRATORS A CITIZEN OF ANCYRA
0949-134657-0001 HAD PREPARED FOR HIS OWN USE A PURPLE GARMENT
0949-134657-0002 THE MONARCH AFTER MAKING SOME INQUIRY INTO THE RANK AND CHARACTER OF HIS RIVAL DESPATCHED THE INFORMER WITH A PRESENT OF A PAIR OF PURPLE SLIPPERS TO COMPLETE THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS IMPERIAL HABIT
0949-134657-0003 WHO HAD RESOLVED TO ASSASSINATE JULIAN IN THE FIELD OF EXERCISE NEAR ANTIOCH THEIR INTEMPERANCE REVEALED THEIR GUILT AND THEY WERE CONDUCTED IN CHAINS TO THE PRESENCE OF THEIR INJURED SOVEREIGN WHO AFTER A LIVELY REPRESENTATION OF THE WICKEDNESS AND FOLLY OF THEIR ENTERPRISE
0949-134657-0004 INSTEAD OF A DEATH OF TORTURE WHICH THEY DESERVED AND EXPECTED PRONOUNCED A SENTENCE OF EXILE AGAINST THE TWO PRINCIPAL OFFENDERS
0949-134657-0005 WAS THE EXECUTION OF A RASH YOUTH WHO WITH A FEEBLE HAND HAD ASPIRED TO SEIZE THE REINS OF EMPIRE BUT THAT YOUTH WAS THE SON OF MARCELLUS THE GENERAL OF CAVALRY
0949-134657-0006 WHICH DIOCLETIAN CONSTANTINE AND THE PATIENT HABITS OF FOURSCORE YEARS HAD ESTABLISHED IN THE EMPIRE A MOTIVE OF SUPERSTITION PREVENTED THE EXECUTION OF THE DESIGN WHICH JULIAN HAD FREQUENTLY MEDITATED
0949-134657-0007 THAT THEY NO LONGER REMEMBERED ITS SERVILE AND HUMILIATING ORIGIN THE OFFICE OR RATHER THE NAME OF CONSUL WAS CHERISHED BY A PRINCE WHO CONTEMPLATED WITH REVERENCE THE RUINS OF THE REPUBLIC
0949-134657-0008 DURING THE GAMES OF THE CIRCUS HE HAD IMPRUDENTLY OR DESIGNEDLY PERFORMED THE MANUMISSION OF A SLAVE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CONSUL THE MOMENT HE WAS REMINDED THAT HE HAD TRESPASSED ON THE JURISDICTION OF ANOTHER MAGISTRATE
0949-134657-0009 HE CONDEMNED HIMSELF TO PAY A FINE OF TEN POUNDS OF GOLD AND EMBRACED THIS PUBLIC OCCASION OF DECLARING TO THE WORLD THAT HE WAS SUBJECT
0949-134657-0010 THE SPIRIT OF HIS ADMINISTRATION AND HIS REGARD
0949-134657-0011 THAT ONE HALF OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL
0949-134657-0012 WHICH WAS PERMITTED TO REPRESENT THE MAJESTY OF THE ROMAN NAME
0949-134657-0013 SO MANY IDLE CITIZENS FROM THE SERVICES OF THEIR COUNTRY AND BY IMPOSING AN EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLIC DUTIES HE RESTORED THE STRENGTH THE SPLENDOR OR ACCORDING TO THE GLOWING
0949-134657-0014 THE VENERABLE AGE OF GREECE EXCITED THE MOST TENDER COMPASSION IN THE MIND OF JULIAN WHICH KINDLED INTO RAPTURE WHEN HE RECOLLECTED THE GODS THE HEROES AND THE MEN SUPERIOR TO HEROES AND TO GODS WHO HAVE BEQUEATHED TO THE LATEST POSTERITY THE MONUMENTS OF THEIR GENIUS
0949-134657-0015 ARGOS FOR HER DELIVERER THE PRIDE OF CORINTH AGAIN RISING FROM HER RUINS WITH THE HONORS OF A ROMAN COLONY EXACTED A TRIBUTE FROM THE ADJACENT REPUBLICS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEFRAYING THE GAMES OF THE ISTHMUS
0949-134657-0016 FROM THIS TRIBUTE THE CITIES OF ELIS OF DELPHI AND OF ARGOS WHICH HAD INHERITED FROM THEIR REMOTE ANCESTORS THE SACRED OFFICE OF PERPETUATING THE OLYMPIC THE PYTHIAN AND THE NEMEAN GAMES CLAIMED A JUST EXEMPTION
0949-134657-0017 WHO SEEMS TO HAVE CONSULTED ONLY THE INTEREST OF THE CAPITAL IN WHICH HE RESIDED SEVEN YEARS AFTER THIS SENTENCE
0949-134657-0018 AND HIS ELOQUENCE WAS INTERPOSED
0949-134657-0019 AND IF THEY CONDESCENDED TO HARANGUE THE SOLDIERS WHOM THEY FEARED THEY TREATED WITH SILENT DISDAIN THE SENATORS WHOM THEY DESPISED THE ASSEMBLIES OF THE SENATE WHICH CONSTANTIUS HAD AVOIDED WERE CONSIDERED BY JULIAN AS THE PLACE WHERE HE COULD EXHIBIT
0949-134657-0020 HE ALTERNATELY PRACTISED AS IN A SCHOOL OF DECLAMATION THE SEVERAL MODES OF PRAISE OF CENSURE OF EXHORTATION AND HIS FRIEND LIBANIUS
0949-134657-0021 BUT AS AN AMUSEMENT AND ALTHOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE TRUSTED THE INTEGRITY AND DISCERNMENT OF HIS PRAETORIAN PRAEFECTS HE OFTEN PLACED HIMSELF BY THEIR SIDE ON THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT THE ACUTE PENETRATION OF HIS MIND WAS AGREEABLY OCCUPIED IN DETECTING AND DEFEATING THE CHICANERY OF THE ADVOCATES
0949-134657-0022 WHO LABORED TO DISGUISE THE TRUTHS OF FACTS AND TO PERVERT THE SENSE OF THE LAWS HE SOMETIMES FORGOT THE GRAVITY OF HIS STATION ASKED INDISCREET OR UNSEASONABLE QUESTIONS AND BETRAYED BY THE LOUDNESS OF HIS VOICE AND THE AGITATION OF HIS BODY THE EARNEST VEHEMENCE
0949-134657-0023 BUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN TEMPER PROMPTED HIM TO ENCOURAGE AND EVEN TO SOLICIT THE REPROOF OF HIS FRIENDS AND MINISTERS AND WHENEVER THEY VENTURED TO OPPOSE THE IRREGULAR SALLIES OF HIS PASSIONS THE SPECTATORS COULD OBSERVE THE SHAME AS WELL AS THE GRATITUDE OF THEIR MONARCH
0949-134657-0024 AND JULIAN MIGHT HAVE RAISED HIMSELF TO THE RANK OF MINISTER OR GENERAL OF THE STATE IN WHICH HE WAS BORN A PRIVATE CITIZEN IF THE JEALOUS CAPRICE OF POWER HAD DISAPPOINTED HIS EXPECTATIONS IF HE HAD PRUDENTLY DECLINED THE PATHS OF GREATNESS
0949-134657-0025 THE PORTRAIT OF JULIAN SOMETHING SEEMS WANTING TO THE GRACE AND PERFECTION OF THE WHOLE FIGURE HIS GENIUS WAS LESS POWERFUL AND SUBLIME THAN THAT OF CAESAR
0949-134657-0026 THE ROMANS BEHELD AN EMPEROR WHO MADE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIS DUTIES AND HIS PLEASURES
0949-134657-0027 AND WHO ENDEAVORED ALWAYS TO CONNECT AUTHORITY WITH MERIT AND HAPPINESS WITH VIRTUE EVEN FACTION AND RELIGIOUS FACTION WAS CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUPERIORITY OF HIS GENIUS IN PEACE AS WELL AS IN WAR AND TO CONFESS WITH A SIGH
0949-134657-0028 THAT THE APOSTATE JULIAN WAS A LOVER OF HIS COUNTRY
0949-134660-0000 AND A PART OF THE HILL DISTINGUISHED BY THE NAME OF MORIAH AND LEVELLED BY HUMAN INDUSTRY WAS CROWNED WITH THE STATELY TEMPLE OF THE JEWISH NATION AFTER THE FINAL DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLE BY THE ARMS OF TITUS AND HADRIAN
0949-134660-0001 A PLOUGHSHARE WAS DRAWN OVER THE CONSECRATED GROUND AS A SIGN OF PERPETUAL INTERDICTION
0949-134660-0002 AND THE VACANT SPACE OF THE LOWER CITY WAS FILLED
0949-134660-0003 WHICH SPREAD THEMSELVES OVER THE ADJACENT HILL OF CALVARY
0949-134660-0004 WITH THE WARM FEELINGS OF A RECENT CONVERSION SAGES AND HEROES WHO HAVE VISITED THE MEMORABLE SCENES OF ANCIENT WISDOM OR GLORY
0949-134660-0005 AND HIS FERVENT DEVOTION TO THE MORE IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT THE ZEAL PERHAPS THE AVARICE OF THE CLERGY OF JERUSALEM CHERISHED AND MULTIPLIED THESE BENEFICIAL VISITS
0949-134660-0006 THEY FIXED BY UNQUESTIONABLE TRADITION THE SCENE OF EACH MEMORABLE EVENT THEY EXHIBITED THE INSTRUMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN USED IN THE PASSION OF CHRIST THE NAILS AND THE LANCE THAT HAD PIERCED HIS HANDS HIS FEET AND HIS SIDE
0949-134660-0007 AND WHICH WAS DUG OUT OF THE EARTH IN THE REIGN OF THOSE PRINCES
0949-134660-0008 AS SEEMED NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS EXTRAORDINARY PRESERVATION AND SEASONABLE DISCOVERY WERE GRADUALLY PROPAGATED WITHOUT OPPOSITION THE CUSTODY OF THE TRUE CROSS WHICH ON EASTER SUNDAY WAS SOLEMNLY EXPOSED TO THE PEOPLE WAS INTRUSTED TO THE BISHOP OF
0949-134660-0009 AS THIS GAINFUL BRANCH OF COMMERCE MUST SOON HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED IT WAS FOUND CONVENIENT TO SUPPOSE THAT THE MARVELOUS WOOD POSSESSED A SECRET POWER OF VEGETATION
0949-134660-0010 THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THE PLACE AND THE BELIEF OF A PERPETUAL MIRACLE SHOULD HAVE PRODUCED SOME SALUTARY EFFECTS ON THE MORALS AS WELL AS ON THE FAITH OF THE PEOPLE YET THE MOST RESPECTABLE OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL WRITERS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO CONFESS
0949-134660-0011 NOT ONLY THAT THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM WERE FILLED
0949-134660-0012 THEFT IDOLATRY POISONING MURDER WAS FAMILIAR TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE
0949-134660-0013 THE WEALTH AND PREEMINENCE OF THE CHURCH OF JERUSALEM
0949-134660-0014 BUT THE PROSPECT OF AN IMMEDIATE AND IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE WOULD NOT SUFFER THE IMPATIENT MONARCH TO EXPECT THE REMOTE AND UNCERTAIN EVENT OF THE PERSIAN WAR
0949-134660-0015 ON THE COMMANDING EMINENCE OF MORIAH A STATELY TEMPLE WHICH MIGHT ECLIPSE THE SPLENDOR OF THE CHURCH OF THE RESURRECTION ON THE ADJACENT HILL OF CALVARY
0949-134660-0016 THE HOSTILE MEASURES OF THE PAGAN GOVERNMENT AMONG THE FRIENDS OF THE EMPEROR IF THE NAMES OF EMPEROR AND OF FRIEND ARE NOT INCOMPATIBLE THE FIRST PLACE WAS ASSIGNED BY JULIAN HIMSELF TO THE VIRTUOUS AND LEARNED
0949-134660-0017 BY SEVERE JUSTICE AND MANLY FORTITUDE AND WHILE HE EXERCISED HIS ABILITIES IN THE CIVIL ADMINISTRATION OF BRITAIN HE IMITATED IN HIS POETICAL COMPOSITIONS THE HARMONY AND SOFTNESS OF THE ODES OF SAPPHO
0949-134660-0018 THIS MINISTER TO WHOM JULIAN COMMUNICATED WITHOUT RESERVE HIS MOST CARELESS LEVITIES AND HIS MOST SERIOUS COUNSELS RECEIVED AN EXTRAORDINARY COMMISSION TO RESTORE IN ITS PRISTINE BEAUTY THE TEMPLE OF JERUSALEM
0949-134660-0019 AND THEIR INSOLENT TRIUMPH ALARMED AND EXASPERATED THE CHRISTIAN INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM THE DESIRE OF REBUILDING THE TEMPLE HAS IN EVERY AGE BEEN THE RULING PASSION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL IN THIS PROPITIOUS MOMENT THE MEN FORGOT THEIR AVARICE AND THE WOMEN THEIR DELICACY
0949-134660-0020 POWER AND ENTHUSIASM WERE UNSUCCESSFUL AND THE GROUND OF THE JEWISH TEMPLE
0949-134660-0021 PERHAPS THE ABSENCE AND DEATH OF THE EMPEROR AND THE NEW MAXIMS OF A CHRISTIAN REIGN MIGHT EXPLAIN THE INTERRUPTION OF AN ARDUOUS WORK
0949-134660-0022 AN EARTHQUAKE A WHIRLWIND AND A FIERY ERUPTION WHICH OVERTURNED AND SCATTERED THE NEW FOUNDATIONS OF THE TEMPLE
0949-134660-0023 THE LAST OF THESE WRITERS HAS BOLDLY DECLARED THAT THIS PRETERNATURAL EVENT WAS NOT DISPUTED BY THE INFIDELS AND HIS ASSERTION STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM IS CONFIRMED BY THE UNEXCEPTIONABLE TESTIMONY
0949-134660-0024 WHILST ALYPIUS ASSISTED BY THE GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE URGED WITH VIGOR AND DILIGENCE THE EXECUTION OF THE WORK HORRIBLE BALLS OF FIRE BREAKING OUT NEAR THE FOUNDATIONS WITH FREQUENT AND REITERATED ATTACKS
0949-134660-0025 RENDERED THE PLACE FROM TIME TO TIME INACCESSIBLE TO THE SCORCHED AND BLASTED WORKMEN AND THE VICTORIOUS ELEMENT CONTINUING IN THIS MANNER OBSTINATELY AND RESOLUTELY BENT
0949-134660-0026 AT THIS IMPORTANT CRISIS ANY SINGULAR ACCIDENT OF NATURE WOULD ASSUME THE APPEARANCE AND PRODUCE THE EFFECTS OF A REAL PRODIGY
0949-138545-0000 THE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION CONSIDERED FROM ONE SIDE COLONIZATION WHATEVER THE MOTIVES OF THE EMIGRANTS WAS AN ECONOMIC MATTER IT INVOLVED THE USE OF CAPITAL TO PAY FOR THEIR PASSAGE TO SUSTAIN THEM ON THE VOYAGE AND TO START THEM ON THE WAY OF PRODUCTION
0949-138545-0001 UNDER THIS STERN ECONOMIC NECESSITY PURITANS SCOTCH IRISH GERMANS AND ALL WERE ALIKE LAID IMMIGRANTS WHO PAID THEIR OWN WAY
0949-138545-0002 UNDOUBTEDLY A VERY CONSIDERABLE NUMBER COULD DO SO FOR WE CAN TRACE THE FAMILY FORTUNES OF MANY EARLY SETTLERS HENRY CABOT LODGE IS AUTHORITY FOR THE STATEMENT THAT THE SETTLERS OF NEW ENGLAND WERE DRAWN
0949-138545-0003 THEY DID NOT BELONG TO THE CLASSES FROM WHICH EMIGRATION IS USUALLY SUPPLIED FOR THEY ALL HAD A STAKE IN THE COUNTRY THEY LEFT BEHIND THOUGH IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW HOW ACCURATE THIS STATEMENT IS OR HOW APPLICABLE TO THE OTHER COLONIES
0949-138545-0004 NO STUDY HAS AS YET BEEN MADE TO GRATIFY THAT INTEREST FOR THE PRESENT IT IS AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM JUST HOW MANY OF THE COLONISTS WERE ABLE TO BEAR THE COST OF THEIR OWN TRANSFER TO THE NEW WORLD INDENTURED SERVANTS THAT
0949-138545-0005 TO OVERCOME THIS DIFFICULTY A PLAN WAS WORKED OUT WHEREBY SHIPOWNERS AND OTHER PERSONS OF MEANS FURNISHED THE PASSAGE MONEY TO IMMIGRANTS IN RETURN FOR THEIR PROMISE OR BOND TO WORK FOR A TERM OF YEARS TO REPAY THE SUM ADVANCED
0949-138545-0006 THIS SYSTEM WAS CALLED INDENTURED SERVITUDE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE NUMBER OF BOND SERVANTS EXCEEDED THE ORIGINAL TWENTY THOUSAND PURITANS THE YEOMEN THE VIRGINIA GENTLEMEN AND THE HUGUENOTS COMBINED
0949-138545-0007 ALL THE WAY DOWN THE COAST FROM MASSACHUSETTS TO GEORGIA WERE TO BE FOUND IN THE FIELDS KITCHENS AND WORKSHOPS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN SERVING OUT TERMS OF BONDAGE GENERALLY RANGING FROM FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS
0949-138545-0008 IN THE PROPRIETARY COLONIES THE PROPORTION OF BOND SERVANTS WAS VERY HIGH THE BALTIMORES PENNS CARTERETS AND OTHER PROMOTERS ANXIOUSLY SOUGHT FOR WORKERS OF EVERY NATIONALITY TO TILL THEIR FIELDS FOR LAND WITHOUT LABOR WAS WORTH NO MORE THAN LAND IN THE MOON
0949-138545-0009 HENCE THE GATES OF THE PROPRIETARY COLONIES WERE FLUNG WIDE OPEN EVERY INDUCEMENT WAS OFFERED TO IMMIGRANTS IN THE FORM OF CHEAP LAND AND SPECIAL EFFORTS WERE MADE TO INCREASE THE POPULATION BY IMPORTING SERVANTS
0949-138545-0010 THE STORY OF THIS TRAFFIC IN WHITE SERVANTS IS ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING THINGS IN THE HISTORY OF LABOR BONDMEN DIFFERED FROM THE SERFS OF THE FEUDAL AGE IN THAT THEY WERE NOT BOUND TO THE SOIL BUT TO THE MASTER THEY LIKEWISE DIFFERED FROM THE NEGRO SLAVES
0949-138545-0011 IN THAT THEIR SERVITUDE HAD A TIME LIMIT STILL THEY WERE SUBJECT TO MANY SPECIAL DISABILITIES IT WAS FOR INSTANCE A COMMON PRACTICE TO IMPOSE ON THEM PENALTIES FAR HEAVIER THAN WERE IMPOSED UPON FREEMEN FOR THE SAME OFFENSE
0949-138545-0012 A FREE CITIZEN OF PENNSYLVANIA WHO INDULGED IN HORSE RACING AND GAMBLING WAS LET OFF WITH A FINE A WHITE SERVANT GUILTY OF THE SAME UNLAWFUL CONDUCT WAS WHIPPED AT THE POST AND FINED AS WELL
0949-138545-0013 THE CONDITION OF WHITE BONDMEN IN VIRGINIA ACCORDING TO LODGE WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN THAT OF SLAVES LOOSE INDENTURES AND HARSH LAWS PUT THEM AT THE MERCY OF THEIR MASTERS
0949-138545-0014 THAT SUCH WAS THEIR LOT IN ALL OTHER COLONIES THEIR FATE DEPENDED UPON THE TEMPER OF THEIR MASTERS CRUEL
0949-138545-0015 A CHANCE TO REACH THE NEW AN OPPORTUNITY TO WRESTLE WITH FATE FOR FREEDOM AND A HOME OF THEIR OWN WHEN THEIR WEARY YEARS OF SERVITUDE WERE OVER IF THEY SURVIVED THEY MIGHT OBTAIN LAND OF THEIR OWN OR SETTLE AS FREE MECHANICS IN THE TOWNS
0949-138545-0016 FOR MANY A BONDMAN THE GAMBLE PROVED TO BE A LOSING VENTURE BECAUSE HE FOUND HIMSELF UNABLE TO RISE OUT OF THE STATE OF POVERTY AND DEPENDENCE INTO WHICH HIS SERVITUDE CARRIED HIM FOR THOUSANDS ON THE CONTRARY BONDAGE PROVED TO BE A REAL AVENUE TO FREEDOM AND PROSPERITY
0949-138545-0017 SOME OF THE BEST CITIZENS OF AMERICA HAVE THE BLOOD OF INDENTURED SERVANTS IN THEIR VEINS THE TRANSPORTED INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE
0949-138545-0018 IN THEIR ANXIETY TO SECURE SETTLERS THE COMPANIES AND PROPRIETORS HAVING COLONIES IN AMERICA EITHER RESORTED TO OR CONNIVED AT THE PRACTICE OF KIDNAPPING MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN FROM THE STREETS OF ENGLISH CITIES
0949-138545-0019 IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY IT WAS OFFICIALLY ESTIMATED THAT TEN THOUSAND PERSONS WERE SPIRITED AWAY TO AMERICA MANY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE PRACTICE WERE YOUNG CHILDREN FOR THE TRAFFIC IN THEM WAS HIGHLY PROFITABLE
0949-138545-0020 ORPHANS AND DEPENDENTS WERE SOMETIMES DISPOSED OF IN AMERICA BY RELATIVES UNWILLING TO SUPPORT THEM IN A SINGLE YEAR
0949-138545-0021 IN THIS GRUESOME BUSINESS THERE LURKED MANY TRAGEDIES AND VERY FEW ROMANCES PARENTS WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN AND HUSBANDS FROM THEIR WIVES HUNDREDS OF SKILLED ARTISANS CARPENTERS SMITHS AND WEAVERS
0949-138545-0022 UTTERLY DISAPPEARED AS IF SWALLOWED UP BY DEATH A FEW THUS DRAGGED OFF TO THE NEW WORLD
0949-138545-0024 INDEED THEY EXAGGERATED ITS EVILS FOR MANY OF THE CRIMINALS WERE ONLY MILD OFFENDERS AGAINST UNDULY HARSH AND CRUEL LAWS A PEASANT CAUGHT SHOOTING A RABBIT ON A LORD'S ESTATE
0949-138545-0025 OR A LUCKLESS SERVANT GIRL WHO PURLOINED A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF WAS BRANDED AS A CRIMINAL ALONG WITH STURDY THIEVES AND INCORRIGIBLE RASCALS OTHER TRANSPORTED OFFENDERS WERE POLITICAL CRIMINALS THAT IS PERSONS WHO CRITICIZED OR OPPOSED THE GOVERNMENT
0949-138545-0026 AND SCOTCH AND ENGLISH SUBJECTS IN GENERAL WHO JOINED IN POLITICAL UPRISINGS AGAINST THE KING THE AFRICAN SLAVES RIVALING IN NUMBERS IN THE COURSE OF TIME THE INDENTURED SERVANTS AND WHITES CARRIED TO AMERICA AGAINST THEIR WILL WERE THE AFRICAN NEGROES
0949-138545-0027 BROUGHT TO AMERICA AND SOLD INTO SLAVERY WHEN THIS FORM OF BONDAGE WAS FIRST INTRODUCED INTO VIRGINIA IN SIXTEEN NINETEEN IT WAS LOOKED UPON AS A TEMPORARY NECESSITY TO BE DISCARDED WITH THE INCREASE OF THE WHITE POPULATION MOREOVER IT DOES NOT APPEAR
0949-138545-0028 THAT THOSE PLANTERS WHO FIRST BOUGHT NEGROES AT THE AUCTION BLOCK INTENDED TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM OF PERMANENT BONDAGE ONLY BY A SLOW PROCESS DID CHATTEL SLAVERY TAKE FIRM ROOT AND BECOME RECOGNIZED AS THE LEADING SOURCE OF THE LABOR SUPPLY IN SIXTEEN FIFTY
0949-138545-0029 THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF SLAVERY THERE WERE ONLY THREE HUNDRED AFRICANS IN VIRGINIA THE GREAT INCREASE IN LATER YEARS WAS DUE IN NO SMALL MEASURE TO THE INORDINATE ZEAL FOR PROFITS THAT SEIZED SLAVE TRADERS BOTH IN OLD AND IN NEW ENGLAND
0949-138545-0030 FINDING IT RELATIVELY EASY TO SECURE NEGROES IN AFRICA THEY CROWDED THE SOUTHERN PORTS WITH THEIR VESSELS THE ENGLISH ROYAL AFRICAN COMPANY SENT TO AMERICA ANNUALLY BETWEEN SEVENTEEN THIRTEEN AND SEVENTEEN FORTY THREE FROM FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND SLAVES
0949-138545-0031 THE SHIP OWNERS OF NEW ENGLAND WERE NOT FAR BEHIND THEIR ENGLISH BRETHREN IN PUSHING THIS EXTRAORDINARY TRAFFIC AS THE PROPORTION OF THE NEGROES TO THE FREE WHITE POPULATION STEADILY ROSE AND AS WHOLE SECTIONS WERE OVERRUN WITH SLAVES AND SLAVE TRADERS THE SOUTHERN COLONIES GREW ALARMED
0949-138545-0032 THIS EFFORT WAS FUTILE FOR THE ROYAL GOVERNOR PROMPTLY VETOED IT FROM TIME TO TIME SIMILAR BILLS WERE PASSED ONLY TO MEET WITH ROYAL DISAPPROVAL SOUTH CAROLINA IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED IMPORTATION BUT THE MEASURE WAS KILLED BY THE BRITISH CROWN
0949-138545-0033 AS LATE AS SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO VIRGINIA NOT DAUNTED BY A CENTURY OF REBUFFS SENT TO GEORGE THE THIRD A PETITION IN THIS VEIN THE IMPORTATION OF SLAVES INTO THE COLONIES FROM THE COAST OF AFRICA
0949-138545-0034 DEEPLY IMPRESSED WITH THESE SENTIMENTS WE MOST HUMBLY BESEECH YOUR MAJESTY TO REMOVE ALL THOSE RESTRAINTS ON YOUR MAJESTY'S GOVERNORS OF THIS COLONY WHICH INHIBIT THEIR ASSENTING TO SUCH LAWS AS MIGHT CHECK SO VERY PERNICIOUS A COMMERCE
0949-138545-0035 ALL SUCH PROTESTS WERE WITHOUT AVAIL THE NEGRO POPULATION GREW BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS UNTIL ON THE EVE OF THE REVOLUTION IT AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN HALF A MILLION IN FIVE STATES MARYLAND VIRGINIA THE TWO CAROLINAS AND GEORGIA
0949-138545-0036 THE SLAVES NEARLY EQUALLED OR ACTUALLY EXCEEDED THE WHITES IN NUMBER IN SOUTH CAROLINA THEY FORMED ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF THE POPULATION EVEN IN THE MIDDLE COLONIES OF DELAWARE AND PENNSYLVANIA ABOUT ONE FIFTH OF THE INHABITANTS WERE FROM AFRICA TO THE NORTH THE PROPORTION OF SLAVES STEADILY DIMINISHED
0949-138545-0037 INCLUDING A FEW FREEDMEN THE CLIMATE THE SOIL THE COMMERCE AND THE INDUSTRY OF THE NORTH WERE ALL UNFAVORABLE TO THE GROWTH OF A SERVILE POPULATION STILL SLAVERY THOUGH SECTIONAL WAS A PART OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM OF ECONOMY
0949-138545-0038 NORTHERN SHIPS CARRIED SLAVES TO THE SOUTHERN COLONIES AND THE PRODUCE OF THE PLANTATIONS TO EUROPE IF THE NORTHERN STATES WILL CONSULT THEIR INTEREST THEY WILL NOT OPPOSE THE INCREASE IN SLAVES WHICH WILL INCREASE THE COMMODITIES
0949-138545-0039 OF WHICH THEY WILL BECOME THE CARRIERS SAID JOHN RUTLEDGE OF SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE CONVENTION WHICH FRAMED THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES
0949-162667-0000 IRRUPTION OF NORTHERN PEOPLE UPON THE ROMAN TERRITORIES VISIGOTHS BARBARIANS CALLED IN BY STILICHO VANDALS IN AFRICA FRANKS AND BURGUNDIANS GIVE THEIR NAMES TO FRANCE AND BURGUNDY THE HUNS
0949-162667-0001 ANGLES GIVE THE NAME TO ENGLAND ATTILA KING OF THE HUNS IN ITALY GENSERIC TAKES ROME THE LOMBARDS THE PEOPLE WHO INHABIT THE NORTHERN PARTS BEYOND THE RHINE AND THE DANUBE
0949-162667-0002 LIVING IN A HEALTHY AND PROLIFIC REGION FREQUENTLY INCREASE TO SUCH VAST MULTITUDES THAT PART OF THEM ARE COMPELLED TO ABANDON THEIR NATIVE SOIL AND SEEK A HABITATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES THE METHOD ADOPTED
0949-162667-0003 WHEN ONE OF THESE PROVINCES HAD TO BE RELIEVED OF ITS SUPERABUNDANT POPULATION WAS TO DIVIDE INTO THREE PARTS EACH CONTAINING AN EQUAL NUMBER OF NOBLES AND OF PEOPLE OF RICH AND OF POOR THE THIRD UPON WHOM THE LOT FELL
0949-162667-0004 THE ANCIENT SEAT OF THEIR DOMINION AND FIXED THEIR RESIDENCE AT CONSTANTINOPLE FOR BY THIS STEP THEY EXPOSED THE WESTERN EMPIRE
0949-162667-0005 THE REMOTENESS OF THEIR POSITION PREVENTING THEM EITHER FROM SEEING OR PROVIDING FOR ITS NECESSITIES TO SUFFER THE OVERTHROW OF SUCH AN EXTENSIVE EMPIRE ESTABLISHED BY THE BLOOD OF SO MANY BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS MEN
0949-162667-0006 SHOWED NO LESS FOLLY IN THE PRINCES THEMSELVES THAN INFIDELITY IN THEIR MINISTERS
0949-162667-0007 CONTRIBUTED TO ITS RUIN AND THESE BARBARIANS EXHIBITED MUCH ABILITY AND PERSEVERANCE IN ACCOMPLISHING THEIR OBJECT THE FIRST OF THESE NORTHERN NATIONS THAT INVADED THE EMPIRE AFTER THE CIMBRIANS
0949-162667-0008 WHO WERE CONQUERED BY CAIUS MARIUS WAS THE VISIGOTHS WHICH NAME IN OUR LANGUAGE SIGNIFIES WESTERN GOTHS THESE AFTER SOME BATTLES FOUGHT ALONG ITS CONFINES LONG HELD THEIR SEAT OF DOMINION UPON THE DANUBE WITH CONSENT OF THE EMPERORS
0949-162667-0009 AND ALTHOUGH MOVED BY VARIOUS CAUSES THEY OFTEN ATTACKED THE ROMAN PROVINCES WERE ALWAYS KEPT IN SUBJECTION BY THE IMPERIAL FORCES THE EMPEROR THEODOSIUS CONQUERED THEM WITH GREAT GLORY AND BEING WHOLLY REDUCED TO HIS POWER
0949-162667-0010 THEY NO LONGER SELECTED A SOVEREIGN OF THEIR OWN BUT SATISFIED WITH THE TERMS WHICH HE GRANTED THEM LIVED AND FOUGHT UNDER HIS ENSIGNS AND AUTHORITY ON THE DEATH OF THEODOSIUS HIS SONS ARCADIUS AND HONORIUS SUCCEEDED TO THE EMPIRE
0949-162667-0011 INGRATIATED HIMSELF WITH THE NEW EMPERORS AND AT THE SAME TIME SO DISTURBED THEIR GOVERNMENT
0949-162667-0012 TO MAKE THE VISIGOTHS THEIR ENEMIES HE ADVISED THAT THE ACCUSTOMED STIPEND ALLOWED TO THIS PEOPLE SHOULD BE WITHHELD AND AS HE THOUGHT THESE ENEMIES WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT ALONE TO DISTURB THE EMPIRE
0949-162667-0013 HE CONTRIVED THAT THE BURGUNDIANS FRANKS VANDALS AND ALANS A NORTHERN PEOPLE IN SEARCH OF NEW HABITATIONS SHOULD ASSAIL THE ROMAN PROVINCES
0949-162667-0014 THE VISIGOTHS ON BEING DEPRIVED OF THEIR SUBSIDY CREATED ALARIC THEIR KING AND HAVING ASSAILED THE EMPIRE SUCCEEDED AFTER MANY REVERSES IN OVERRUNNING ITALY AND FINALLY IN PILLAGING ROME AFTER THIS VICTORY ALARIC DIED
0949-162667-0015 AND HIS SUCCESSOR ASTOLPHUS HAVING MARRIED PLACIDIA SISTER OF THE EMPERORS AGREED WITH THEM TO GO TO THE RELIEF OF GAUL AND SPAIN WHICH PROVINCES HAD BEEN ASSAILED BY THE VANDALS BURGUNDIANS ALANS AND FRANKS FROM THE CAUSES BEFORE MENTIONED
0949-162667-0016 BEING PRESSED BY THE VISIGOTHS AND UNABLE TO RESIST THEM WERE INVITED BY BONIFACE WHO GOVERNED AFRICA FOR THE EMPIRE TO OCCUPY THAT PROVINCE FOR BEING IN REBELLION HE WAS AFRAID HIS ERROR WOULD BECOME KNOWN TO THE EMPEROR
0949-162667-0017 FOR THESE REASONS THE VANDALS GLADLY UNDERTOOK THE ENTERPRISE AND UNDER GENSERIC THEIR KING BECAME LORDS OF AFRICA AT THIS TIME THEODOSIUS SON OF ARCADIUS SUCCEEDED TO THE EMPIRE
0949-162667-0018 AND WHICH FROM THEIR NAME IS STILL CALLED HUNGARY TO THESE DISORDERS IT MUST BE ADDED THAT THE EMPEROR SEEING HIMSELF ATTACKED ON SO MANY SIDES TO LESSEN THE NUMBER OF HIS ENEMIES BEGAN TO TREAT FIRST WITH THE VANDALS THEN WITH THE FRANKS
0949-162667-0019 A COURSE WHICH DIMINISHED HIS OWN POWER AND INCREASED THAT OF THE BARBARIANS NOR WAS THE ISLAND OF BRITAIN WHICH IS NOW CALLED ENGLAND SECURE FROM THEM FOR THE BRITONS BEING APPREHENSIVE OF THOSE WHO HAD OCCUPIED GAUL CALLED THE ANGLI
0949-162667-0020 A PEOPLE OF GERMANY TO THEIR AID AND THESE UNDER VORTIGERN THEIR KING FIRST DEFENDED AND THEN DROVE THEM FROM THE ISLAND OF WHICH THEY TOOK POSSESSION AND AFTER THEMSELVES NAMED THE COUNTRY ENGLAND
0949-162667-0021 BUT THE INHABITANTS BEING ROBBED OF THEIR HOME BECAME DESPERATE BY NECESSITY AND RESOLVED TO TAKE POSSESSION OF SOME OTHER COUNTRY ALTHOUGH THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO DEFEND THEIR OWN THEY THEREFORE CROSSED THE SEA WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND SETTLED IN THE COUNTRY NEAREST TO THE BEACH
0949-162667-0022 WHICH FROM THEMSELVES IS CALLED BRITTANY THE HUNS WHO WERE SAID ABOVE TO HAVE OCCUPIED PANNONIA
0949-162667-0023 TURINGI AND OSTRO OR EASTERN GOTHS
0949-162667-0024 AND VELAMIR KING OF THE OSTROGOTHS BECAME SUBJECT TO HIM ATTILA HAVING ENTERED ITALY LAID SIEGE TO AQUILEIA WHERE HE REMAINED WITHOUT ANY OBSTACLE FOR TWO YEARS WASTING THE COUNTRY ROUND AND DISPERSING THE INHABITANTS
0949-162667-0025 THIS AS WILL BE RELATED IN ITS PLACE CAUSED THE ORIGIN OF VENICE
0949-162667-0026 HE DIRECTED HIS COURSE TOWARDS ROME FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF WHICH HE ABSTAINED AT THE ENTREATY OF THE PONTIFF HIS RESPECT FOR WHOM WAS SO GREAT THAT HE LEFT ITALY AND RETIRED INTO AUSTRIA WHERE HE DIED AFTER THE DEATH OF ATTILA
0949-162667-0027 VELAMIR KING OF THE OSTROGOTHS AND THE HEADS OF THE OTHER NATIONS TOOK ARMS AGAINST HIS SONS
0949-162667-0028 SLEW THE ONE AND COMPELLED THE OTHER WITH HIS HUNS TO REPASS THE DANUBE AND RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY
0949-162667-0029 ATTILA HAVING LEFT ITALY VALENTINIAN EMPEROR OF THE WEST THOUGHT OF RESTORING THE COUNTRY AND THAT HE MIGHT BE MORE READY TO DEFEND IT AGAINST THE BARBARIANS ABANDONED ROME AND REMOVED THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT TO RAVENNA THE MISFORTUNES WHICH BEFELL THE WESTERN EMPIRE
0949-162667-0030 CREATED AN EMPEROR FOR THEIR DEFENSE OR SUFFERED SOME ONE TO USURP THE DOMINION THIS OCCURRED AT THE PERIOD OF WHICH WE NOW SPEAK WHEN MAXIMUS A ROMAN AFTER THE DEATH OF VALENTINIAN SEIZED THE GOVERNMENT AND COMPELLED EUDOCIA
0949-162667-0031 BUT SHE BEING OF IMPERIAL BLOOD SCORNED THE CONNECTION OF A PRIVATE CITIZEN AND BEING ANXIOUS TO AVENGE HERSELF FOR THE INSULT SECRETLY PERSUADED GENSERIC KING OF THE VANDALS AND MASTER OF AFRICA TO COME TO ITALY
0949-162667-0032 HE ALSO RAVAGED MANY OTHER PLACES IN ITALY AND THEN LOADED WITH WEALTH WITHDREW TO AFRICA THE ROMANS HAVING RETURNED TO THEIR CITY AND MAXIMUS BEING DEAD
0949-162667-0033 AFTER THIS SEVERAL IMPORTANT EVENTS OCCURRED BOTH IN ITALY
0949-162667-0034 AND AFTER THE DEATHS OF MANY EMPERORS THE EMPIRE OF CONSTANTINOPLE DEVOLVED UPON ZENO AND THAT OF ROME UPON ORESTES AND AUGUSTULUS HIS SON WHO OBTAINED THE SOVEREIGNTY BY FRAUD WHILE THEY WERE DESIGNING TO HOLD BY FORCE WHAT THEY HAD OBTAINED BY TREACHERY
0949-162667-0035 WHO AFTER THE DEATH OF ATTILA AS BEFORE REMARKED
0949-162667-0036 INTO THE DISTRICTS WHICH THEY LEFT UNOCCUPIED THE LONGOBARDI OR LOMBARDS ALSO A NORTHERN PEOPLE ENTERED LED BY GODOGO THEIR KING ODOACER CONQUERED AND SLEW ORESTES NEAR PAVIA
1112-1043-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN A SPRAINED ANKLE I WAS PANIC STRICKEN AS I RAN ALONG THE CORRIDOR I WAS CONFIDENT THAT THE MYSTERIOUS INTRUDER AND PROBABLE MURDERER HAD BEEN FOUND AND THAT HE LAY DEAD OR DYING AT THE FOOT OF THE CHUTE I GOT DOWN THE STAIRCASE SOMEHOW AND THROUGH THE KITCHEN TO THE BASEMENT STAIRS
1112-1043-0001 MISTER JAMIESON HAD BEEN BEFORE ME AND THE DOOR STOOD OPEN LIDDY WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE KITCHEN HOLDING A FRYING PAN BY THE HANDLE AS A WEAPON DON'T GO DOWN THERE SHE YELLED WHEN SHE SAW ME MOVING TOWARD THE BASEMENT STAIRS
1112-1043-0002 I SAID SHARPLY COME DOWN WITH US AND TURN ON ALL THE LIGHTS SHE OFFERED HER RESIGNATION AS USUAL ON THE SPOT BUT I TOOK HER BY THE ARM AND SHE CAME ALONG FINALLY SHE SWITCHED ON ALL THE LIGHTS AND POINTED TO A DOOR JUST AHEAD THAT'S THE DOOR SHE SAID SULKILY
1112-1043-0003 THE KEY'S IN IT BUT THE KEY WAS NOT IN IT MISTER JAMIESON SHOOK IT BUT IT WAS A HEAVY DOOR WELL LOCKED AND THEN HE STOOPED AND BEGAN PUNCHING AROUND THE KEYHOLE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL WHEN HE STOOD UP HIS FACE WAS EXULTANT
1112-1043-0004 IT'S LOCKED ON THE INSIDE HE SAID IN A LOW TONE
1112-1043-0005 THAT IS UNLESS YOU DIDN'T SEE ANY ONE CROSSING THE LAWN OR SKULKING AROUND THE HOUSE DID YOU
1112-1043-0006 BUT THE IRON GATES ONCE CLOSED AND TENDED BY THE LODGE KEEPER NOW STOOD PERMANENTLY OPEN THE DAY OF THE MOTOR CAR HAD COME NO ONE HAD TIME FOR CLOSED GATES AND LODGE KEEPERS THE LODGE AT SUNNYSIDE WAS MERELY A SORT OF SUPPLEMENTARY SERVANTS QUARTERS IT WAS AS CONVENIENT IN ITS APPOINTMENTS AS THE BIG HOUSE AND INFINITELY MORE COZY
1112-1043-0007 AS I WENT DOWN THE DRIVE MY THOUGHTS WERE BUSY WHO WOULD IT BE THAT MISTER JAMIESON HAD TRAPPED IN THE CELLAR WOULD WE FIND A BODY OR SOME ONE BADLY INJURED SCARCELY EITHER WHOEVER HAD FALLEN HAD BEEN ABLE TO LOCK THE LAUNDRY DOOR ON THE INSIDE IF THE FUGITIVE HAD COME FROM OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
1112-1043-0008 HOW DID HE GET IN IF IT WAS SOME MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHO COULD IT HAVE BEEN AND THEN A FEELING OF HORROR ALMOST OVERWHELMED ME GERTRUDE GERTRUDE AND HER INJURED ANKLE GERTRUDE FOUND LIMPING SLOWLY UP THE DRIVE WHEN I HAD THOUGHT SHE WAS IN BED
1112-1043-0009 I TRIED TO PUT THE THOUGHT AWAY BUT IT WOULD NOT GO IF GERTRUDE HAD BEEN ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE THAT NIGHT WHY HAD SHE FLED FROM MISTER JAMIESON THE IDEA PUZZLING AS IT WAS SEEMED BORNE OUT BY THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WHOEVER HAD TAKEN REFUGE AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS
1112-1043-0010 AND YET EVERY WAY I TURNED I SEEMED TO FIND SOMETHING THAT POINTED TO SUCH A CONNECTION
1112-1043-0011 HE DID HE ABSOLUTELY DISAPPEARED IN THE DUSK WITHOUT MY GETTING MORE THAN A GLIMPSE OF HIS FACE I HAD A VAGUE IMPRESSION OF UNFAMILIAR FEATURES AND OF A SORT OF CAP WITH A VISOR THEN HE WAS GONE I WENT TO THE LODGE AND RAPPED
1112-1043-0012 IT REQUIRED TWO OR THREE POUNDINGS TO BRING THOMAS TO THE DOOR AND HE OPENED IT ONLY AN INCH OR SO WHERE IS WARNER I ASKED I
1112-1043-0013 IT WAS SO EVIDENT THAT THOMAS DID NOT WANT ME INSIDE THAT I WENT IN TELL WARNER HE IS NEEDED IN A HURRY I REPEATED AND TURNED INTO THE LITTLE SITTING ROOM I COULD HEAR THOMAS GOING UP THE STAIRS COULD HEAR HIM ROUSE WARNER AND THE STEPS OF THE CHAUFFEUR AS HE HURRIEDLY DRESSED BUT MY ATTENTION WAS BUSY WITH THE ROOM BELOW
1112-1043-0014 ON THE CENTER TABLE OPEN WAS A SEALSKIN TRAVELING BAG IT WAS FILLED WITH GOLD TOPPED BOTTLES AND BRUSHES AND IT BREATHED OPULENCE LUXURY FEMININITY FROM EVERY INCH OF SURFACE
1112-1043-0015 HE WAS COMPLETELY BUT SOMEWHAT INCONGRUOUSLY DRESSED AND HIS OPEN BOYISH FACE LOOKED ABASHED
1112-1043-0016 AND EARN GOOD SALARIES IN A CONGENIAL OCCUPATION
1112-1043-0017 MISTER JAMIESON WANTS YOU TO HELP HIM BREAK THE LOCK WARNER WHOSE BAG IS THIS HE WAS IN THE DOORWAY BY THIS TIME AND HE PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR WARNER I CALLED COME BACK HERE WHOSE BAG IS THIS
1112-1043-0018 IT BELONGS TO THOMAS HE SAID AND FLED UP THE DRIVE TO THOMAS A LONDON BAG WITH MIRRORS AND COSMETIC JARS OF WHICH THOMAS COULD NOT EVEN HAVE GUESSED THE USE
1112-1043-0019 HOWEVER I PUT THE BAG IN THE BACK OF MY MIND WHICH WAS FAST BECOMING STORED WITH ANOMALOUS AND APPARENTLY IRRECONCILABLE FACTS AND FOLLOWED WARNER TO THE HOUSE LIDDY HAD COME BACK TO THE KITCHEN
1112-1043-0020 THE DOOR TO THE BASEMENT STAIRS WAS DOUBLE BARRED AND HAD A TABLE PUSHED AGAINST IT AND BESIDE HER ON THE TABLE WAS MOST OF THE KITCHEN PARAPHERNALIA DID YOU SEE IF THERE WAS ANY ONE MISSING IN THE HOUSE I ASKED IGNORING THE ARRAY OF SAUCE PANS ROLLING PINS AND THE POKER OF THE RANGE
1112-1043-0021 ROSIE IS MISSING LIDDY SAID WITH UNCTION SHE HAD OBJECTED TO ROSIE THE PARLOR MAID FROM THE START MISSUS WATSON WENT INTO HER ROOM AND FOUND SHE HAD GONE WITHOUT HER HAT
1112-1043-0022 PEOPLE THAT TRUST THEMSELVES A DOZEN MILES FROM THE CITY IN STRANGE HOUSES WITH SERVANTS THEY DON'T KNOW NEEDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY WAKE UP SOME MORNING AND FIND THEIR THROATS CUT AFTER WHICH CAREFULLY VEILED SARCASM LIDDY RELAPSED INTO GLOOM
1112-1043-0023 WARNER CAME IN THEN WITH A HANDFUL OF SMALL TOOLS AND MISTER JAMIESON WENT WITH HIM TO THE BASEMENT ODDLY ENOUGH I WAS NOT ALARMED WITH ALL MY HEART I WISHED FOR HALSEY BUT I WAS NOT FRIGHTENED AT THE DOOR HE WAS TO FORCE WARNER PUT DOWN HIS TOOLS AND LOOKED AT IT
1112-1043-0024 THEN HE TURNED THE HANDLE WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST DIFFICULTY THE DOOR OPENED REVEALING THE BLACKNESS OF THE DRYING ROOM BEYOND MISTER JAMIESON GAVE AN EXCLAMATION OF DISGUST GONE HE SAID
1112-1043-0025 CONFOUND SUCH CARELESS WORK I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT WAS TRUE ENOUGH WE GOT THE LIGHTS ON FINALLY AND LOOKED ALL THROUGH THE THREE ROOMS THAT CONSTITUTED THIS WING OF THE BASEMENT EVERYTHING WAS QUIET AND EMPTY
1112-1043-0026 AN EXPLANATION OF HOW THE FUGITIVE HAD ESCAPED INJURY WAS FOUND IN A HEAPED UP BASKET OF CLOTHES UNDER THE CHUTE THE BASKET HAD BEEN OVERTURNED BUT THAT WAS ALL MISTER JAMIESON EXAMINED THE WINDOWS ONE WAS UNLOCKED AND OFFERED AN EASY ESCAPE
1112-1043-0027 THE WINDOW OR THE DOOR WHICH WAY HAD THE FUGITIVE ESCAPED THE DOOR SEEMED MOST PROBABLE AND I HOPED IT HAD BEEN SO I COULD NOT HAVE BORNE JUST THEN TO THINK THAT IT WAS MY POOR GERTRUDE WE HAD BEEN HOUNDING THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND YET
1112-1043-0028 I HAD MET GERTRUDE NOT FAR FROM THAT VERY WINDOW I WENT UP STAIRS AT LAST TIRED AND DEPRESSED MISSUS WATSON AND LIDDY WERE MAKING TEA IN THE KITCHEN IN CERTAIN WALKS OF LIFE THE TEA POT IS THE REFUGE IN TIMES OF STRESS TROUBLE OR SICKNESS
1112-1043-0029 THEY GIVE TEA TO THE DYING AND THEY PUT IT IN THE BABY'S NURSING BOTTLE MISSUS WATSON WAS FIXING A TRAY TO BE SENT IN TO ME AND WHEN I ASKED HER ABOUT ROSIE SHE CONFIRMED HER ABSENCE SHE'S NOT HERE SHE SAID BUT I WOULD NOT THINK MUCH OF THAT MISS INNES
1112-1043-0030 ROSIE IS A PRETTY YOUNG GIRL AND PERHAPS SHE HAS A SWEETHEART IT WILL BE A GOOD THING IF SHE HAS THE MAIDS STAY MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HOLD THEM HERE GERTRUDE HAD GONE BACK TO HER ROOM AND WHILE I WAS DRINKING MY CUP OF HOT TEA
1112-1043-0031 MISTER JAMIESON CAME IN WE MIGHT TAKE UP THE CONVERSATION WHERE WE LEFT OFF AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO HE SAID BUT BEFORE WE GO ON I WANT TO SAY THIS THE PERSON WHO ESCAPED FROM THE LAUNDRY WAS A WOMAN WITH A FOOT OF MODERATE SIZE AND WELL ARCHED
1112-1043-0032 SHE WORE NOTHING BUT A STOCKING ON HER RIGHT FOOT AND IN SPITE OF THE UNLOCKED DOOR SHE ESCAPED BY THE WINDOW AND AGAIN I THOUGHT OF GERTRUDE'S SPRAINED ANKLE
1112-128136-0000 DAVID WESTREN BY MISTER ALFRED HAYES IS A LONG NARRATIVE POEM IN TENNYSONIAN BLANK VERSE A SORT OF SERIOUS NOVEL SET TO MUSIC IT IS SOMEWHAT LACKING IN ACTUALITY
1112-128136-0001 AND THE PICTURESQUE STYLE IN WHICH IT IS WRITTEN RATHER CONTRIBUTES TO THIS EFFECT LENDING THE STORY BEAUTY BUT ROBBING IT OF TRUTH
1112-128136-0002 STILL IT IS NOT WITHOUT POWER AND CULTURED VERSE IS CERTAINLY A PLEASANTER MEDIUM FOR STORY TELLING THAN COARSE AND COMMON PROSE THE HERO OF THE POEM IS A YOUNG CLERGYMAN OF THE MUSCULAR CHRISTIAN SCHOOL
1112-128136-0003 A LOVER OF GOOD CHEER A BUBBLING SOURCE OF JEST AND TALE A MONARCH OF THE GUN A DREADER TYRANT OF THE DARTING TROUT THAN THAT BRIGHT BIRD WHOSE AZURE LIGHTNING THREADS THE BROOKLET'S BOWERY WINDINGS
1112-128136-0004 THE RED FOX DID WELL TO SEEK THE BOULDER STREWN HILL SIDE WHEN WESTREN CHEERED HER DAPPLED FOES THE OTTER HAD CAUSE TO RUE THE DAWN WHEN WESTREN'S FORM LOOMED THROUGH THE STREAMING BRACKEN TO WAYLAY HER LATE RETURN FROM PLUNDER
1112-128136-0005 THE ROUGH PACK BARKING A JEALOUS WELCOME ROUND THEIR FRIEND ONE DAY HE MEETS ON THE RIVER A LOVELY GIRL WHO IS ANGLING AND HELPS HER TO LAND A GALLANT FISH ALL FLASHING IN THE SUN
1112-128136-0006 IN SILVER MAIL INLAID WITH SCARLET GEMS HIS BACK THICK SPRINKLED AS A LEOPARD'S HIDE WITH RICH BROWN SPOTS AND BELLY OF BRIGHT GOLD
1112-128136-0007 THEY NATURALLY FALL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER AND MARRY AND FOR MANY YEARS DAVID WESTREN LEADS A PERFECTLY HAPPY LIFE SUDDENLY CALAMITY COMES UPON HIM
1112-128136-0008 HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN DIE AND HE FINDS HIMSELF ALONE AND DESOLATE THEN BEGINS HIS STRUGGLE LIKE JOB HE CRIES OUT AGAINST THE INJUSTICE OF THINGS AND HIS OWN PERSONAL SORROW MAKES HIM REALISE THE SORROW AND MISERY OF THE WORLD
1112-128136-0009 BUT THE ANSWER THAT SATISFIED JOB DOES NOT SATISFY HIM HE FINDS NO COMFORT IN CONTEMPLATING LEVIATHAN AS IF WE LACKED REMINDING OF BRUTE FORCE AS IF WE NEVER FELT THE CLUMSY HOOF
1112-128136-0010 AS IF THE BULK OF TWENTY MILLION WHALES WERE WORTH ONE PLEADING SOUL OR ALL THE LAWS THAT RULE THE LIFELESS SUNS COULD SOOTHE THE SENSE OF OUTRAGE IN A LOVING HUMAN HEART SUBLIME MAJESTIC
1112-128136-0011 AY BUT WHEN OUR TRUST TOTTERS AND FAITH IS SHATTERED TO THE BASE GRAND WORDS WILL NOT UPREAR IT MISTER HAYES STATES THE PROBLEM OF LIFE EXTREMELY WELL BUT HIS SOLUTION IS SADLY INADEQUATE
1112-128136-0012 BOTH FROM A PSYCHOLOGICAL AND FROM A DRAMATIC POINT OF VIEW DAVID WESTREN ULTIMATELY BECOMES A MILD UNITARIAN A SORT OF PASTORAL STOPFORD BROOKE WITH LEANINGS TOWARDS POSITIVISM
1112-128136-0013 AND WE LEAVE HIM PREACHING PLATITUDES TO A VILLAGE CONGREGATION HOWEVER IN SPITE OF THIS COMMONPLACE CONCLUSION THERE IS A GREAT DEAL IN MISTER HAYES'S POEM THAT IS STRONG AND FINE AND HE UNDOUBTEDLY POSSESSES A FAIR EAR FOR MUSIC
1112-128136-0014 AND A REMARKABLE FACULTY OF POETICAL EXPRESSION SOME OF HIS DESCRIPTIVE TOUCHES OF NATURE SUCH AS IN MEETING WOODS WHEREON A FILM OF MIST SLEPT LIKE THE BLOOM UPON THE PURPLE GRAPE ARE VERY GRACEFUL AND SUGGESTIVE
1112-128136-0015 AND HE WILL PROBABLY MAKE HIS MARK IN LITERATURE THERE IS MUCH THAT IS FASCINATING IN MISTER RENNELL RODD'S LAST VOLUME THE UNKNOWN MADONNA AND OTHER POEMS
1112-128136-0016 MISTER RODD LOOKS AT LIFE WITH ALL THE CHARMING OPTIMISM OF A YOUNG MAN THOUGH HE IS QUITE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT A STRAY NOTE OF MELANCHOLY HERE AND THERE HAS AN ARTISTIC AS WELL AS A POPULAR VALUE
1112-128136-0017 AND HIS VERSE IS DISTINGUISHED BY A CERTAIN REFINEMENT AND PURITY OF OUTLINE THOUGH NOT PASSIONATE HE CAN PLAY VERY PRETTILY WITH THE WORDS OF PASSION AND HIS EMOTIONS ARE QUITE HEALTHY AND QUITE HARMLESS IN EXCELSIS
1112-128136-0018 THE MOST AMBITIOUS POEM IN THE BOOK IS SOMEWHAT TOO ABSTRACT AND METAPHYSICAL AND SUCH LINES AS LIFT THEE O'ER THY HERE AND NOW LOOK BEYOND THINE I AND THOU
1112-128136-0019 ARE EXCESSIVELY TEDIOUS BUT WHEN MISTER RODD LEAVES THE PROBLEM OF THE UNCONDITIONED TO TAKE CARE OF ITSELF AND MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO SOLVE THE MYSTERIES OF THE EGO AND THE NON EGO HE IS VERY PLEASANT READING INDEED
1112-128136-0020 A MAZURKA OF CHOPIN IS CHARMING IN SPITE OF THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE FIFTH LINE AND SO ARE THE VERSES ON ASSISI AND THOSE ON SAN SERVOLO AT VENICE THESE LAST HAVE ALL THE BRILLIANCY OF A CLEVER PASTEL
1112-128136-0021 THE PRETTIEST THING IN THE WHOLE VOLUME IS THIS LITTLE LYRIC ON SPRING SUCH BLUE OF SKY SO PALELY FAIR SUCH GLOW OF EARTH SUCH LUCID AIR SUCH PURPLE ON THE MOUNTAIN LINES SUCH DEEP NEW VERDURE IN THE PINES
1112-128136-0022 THE LIVE LIGHT STRIKES THE BROKEN TOWERS THE CROCUS BULBS BURST INTO FLOWERS THE SAP STRIKES UP THE BLACK VINE STOCK AND THE LIZARD WAKES IN THE SPLINTERED ROCK
1112-128136-0023 AND THE HEART IS TOUCHED WITH A THOUGHT OF GOD THE VERY SILENCE SEEMS TO SING IT MUST BE SPRING IT MUST BE SPRING WE DO NOT CARE FOR PALELY FAIR IN THE FIRST LINE
1112-128136-0024 AND THE REPETITION OF THE WORD STRIKES IS NOT VERY FELICITOUS BUT THE GRACE OF MOVEMENT AND DELICACY OF TOUCH ARE PLEASING THE WIND BY MISTER JAMES ROSS
1112-128136-0025 IS A RATHER GUSTY ODE WRITTEN APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE SCHEME OF METRE AND NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE AS IT LACKS BOTH THE STRENGTH OF THE BLIZZARD AND THE SWEETNESS OF ZEPHYR HERE IS THE OPENING
1112-128136-0026 THE ROAMING TENTLESS WIND NO REST CAN EVER FIND FROM EAST AND WEST AND SOUTH AND NORTH HE IS FOR EVER DRIVEN FORTH FROM THE CHILL EAST WHERE FIERCE HYAENAS SEEK THEIR AWFUL FEAST FROM THE WARM WEST BY BEAMS OF GLITT'RING SUMMER BLEST
1112-128136-0027 NOTHING COULD BE MUCH WORSE THAN THIS AND IF THE LINE WHERE FIERCE HYAENAS SEEK THEIR AWFUL FEAST IS INTENDED TO FRIGHTEN US IT ENTIRELY MISSES ITS EFFECT THE ODE IS FOLLOWED BY SOME SONNETS
1112-128136-0028 WHICH ARE DESTINED WE FEAR TO BE LUDIBRIA VENTIS IMMORTALITY EVEN IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IS NOT GRANTED TO THOSE WHO RHYME AWE AND WAR TOGETHER
1112-128136-0029 MISTER ISAAC SHARP'S SAUL OF TARSUS IS AN INTERESTING AND IN SOME RESPECTS A FINE POEM SAUL OF TARSUS SILENTLY WITH A SILENT COMPANY TO DAMASCUS GATES DREW NIGH
1112-128136-0030 AND HIS EYES TOO AND HIS MIEN WERE
1112-128136-0031 ARE TWO STRONG SIMPLE VERSES AND INDEED THE SPIRIT OF THE WHOLE POEM IS DIGNIFIED AND STATELY THE REST OF THE VOLUME HOWEVER IS DISAPPOINTING ORDINARY THEOLOGY HAS LONG SINCE CONVERTED ITS GOLD INTO LEAD
1112-128136-0032 AND WORDS AND PHRASES THAT ONCE TOUCHED THE HEART OF THE WORLD HAVE BECOME WEARISOME AND MEANINGLESS THROUGH REPETITION IF THEOLOGY DESIRES TO MOVE US SHE MUST RE WRITE HER FORMULAS
1112-128136-0033 THERE IS SOMETHING VERY PLEASANT IN COMING ACROSS A POET WHO CAN APOSTROPHISE BYRON AS TRANSCENDENT STAR THAT GEMS THE FIRMAMENT OF POESY AND CAN SPEAK OF LONGFELLOW AS A MIGHTY TITAN
1112-128136-0034 AND MISTER MACKENZIE'S HIGHLAND DAYDREAMS COULD NOT POSSIBLY OFFEND ANY ONE IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THEY ARE RATHER OLD FASHIONED BUT THIS IS USUALLY THE CASE WITH NATURAL SPONTANEOUS VERSE IT TAKES A GREAT ARTIST TO BE THOROUGHLY MODERN
1112-128136-0035 NATURE IS ALWAYS A LITTLE BEHIND THE AGE THE STORY OF THE CROSS AN ATTEMPT TO VERSIFY THE GOSPEL NARRATIVES IS A STRANGE SURVIVAL OF THE TATE AND BRADY SCHOOL OF POETRY MISTER NASH WHO STYLES HIMSELF
1112-128136-0036 A HUMBLE SOLDIER IN THE ARMY OF FAITH EXPRESSES A HOPE THAT HIS BOOK MAY INVIGORATE DEVOTIONAL FEELING ESPECIALLY AMONG THE YOUNG TO WHOM VERSE IS PERHAPS MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN TO THEIR ELDERS
1112-128136-0037 BUT WE SHOULD BE SORRY TO THINK THAT PEOPLE OF ANY AGE COULD ADMIRE SUCH A PARAPHRASE AS THE FOLLOWING FOXES HAVE HOLES IN WHICH TO SLINK FOR REST THE BIRDS OF AIR FIND SHELTER IN THE NEST BUT HE THE SON OF MAN AND LORD OF ALL
1112-128136-0038 HAS NO ABIDING PLACE HIS OWN TO CALL IT IS A CURIOUS FACT THAT THE WORST WORK IS ALWAYS DONE WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS AND THAT PEOPLE ARE NEVER SO TRIVIAL AS WHEN THEY TAKE THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY
1112-128136-0039 BIRMINGHAM CORNISH BROTHERS
1112-128136-0040 BRISTOL J W ARROWSMITH
1112-128138-0000 MISTER IAN HAMILTON'S BALLAD OF HADJI IS UNDENIABLY CLEVER HADJI IS A WONDERFUL ARAB HORSE THAT A RECKLESS HUNTER RIDES TO DEATH IN THE PURSUIT OF A WILD BOAR AND THE MORAL OF THE POEM FOR THERE IS A MORAL
1112-128138-0001 SEEMS TO BE THAT AN ABSORBING PASSION IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING AND BLUNTS THE HUMAN SYMPATHIES IN THE COURSE OF THE CHASE A LITTLE CHILD IS DROWNED A BRAHMIN MAIDEN MURDERED AND AN AGED PEASANT SEVERELY WOUNDED
1112-128138-0002 SOME OF THE STANZAS ARE VERY GRACEFUL NOTABLY ONE BEGINNING YES LIKE A BUBBLE FILLED WITH SMOKE THE CURD WHITE MOON UPSWIMMING BROKE THE VACANCY OF SPACE
1112-128138-0003 BUT SUCH LINES AS THE FOLLOWING WHICH OCCUR IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGHT WITH THE BOAR I HUNG AS CLOSE AS KEEPSAKE LOCKET ON MAIDEN BREAST BUT FROM ITS SOCKET HE WRENCHED MY BRIDLE ARM
1112-128138-0004 ARE DREADFUL AND HIS BRAINS FESTOONED THE THORN IS NOT A VERY HAPPY WAY OF TELLING THE READER HOW THE BOAR DIED ALL THROUGH THE VOLUME WE FIND THE SAME CURIOUS MIXTURE OF GOOD AND BAD
1112-128138-0005 IS AWKWARD AND UNCOUTH AND YET THE POEM IN WHICH THE EXPRESSION OCCURS HAS SOME PRETTY LINES MISTER IAN HAMILTON SHOULD PRUNE PRUNING WHETHER IN THE GARDEN OR IN THE STUDY
1112-128138-0006 MISTER CATTY DEDICATES HIS BOOK TO THE MEMORY OF WORDSWORTH SHELLEY COLERIDGE AND KEATS A SOMEWHAT POMPOUS SIGNBOARD FOR SUCH VERY ORDINARY WINE
1112-128138-0007 AND AN INSCRIPTION IN GOLDEN LETTERS ON THE COVER INFORMS US THAT HIS POEMS ARE ADDRESSED TO THE RISING GENERATION WHOM HE TELLS US ELSEWHERE HE IS ANXIOUS TO INITIATE INTO THE GREAT COMPREHENSIVE TRUTH THAT
1112-128138-0008 VIRTUE IS NO OTHER THAN SELF INTEREST DEEPLY UNDERSTOOD
1112-128138-0009 BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT CONVEY THAT SECRET TO THE READER IT IS HEAVY ABSTRACT AND PROSAIC AND SHOWS HOW INTOLERABLY DULL A MAN CAN BE WHO HAS THE BEST INTENTIONS AND THE MOST EARNEST BELIEFS
1112-128138-0010 IN THE REST OF THE VOLUME WHERE MISTER CATTY DOES NOT TAKE HIMSELF QUITE SO SERIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME RATHER PLEASING THINGS THE SONNET ON SHELLEY'S ROOM AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE WOULD BE ADMIRABLE
1112-128138-0011 GREEN IN THE WIZARD ARMS OF THE FOAM BEARDED ATLANTIC AN ISLE OF OLD ENCHANTMENT A MELANCHOLY ISLE ENCHANTED AND DREAMING LIES AND THERE BY SHANNON'S FLOWING IN THE MOONLIGHT SPECTRE THIN
1112-128138-0012 THE SPECTRE ERIN SITS WAIL NO MORE LONELY ONE MOTHER OF EXILE WAIL NO MORE BANSHEE OF THE WORLD NO MORE THY SORROWS ARE THE WORLD'S THOU ART NO MORE ALONE THY WRONGS THE WORLD'S
1112-128138-0013 ARE THE FIRST AND LAST STANZAS OF MISTER TODHUNTER'S POEM THE BANSHEE TO THROW AWAY THE NATURAL GRACE OF RHYME FROM A MODERN SONG IS AS MISTER SWINBURNE ONCE REMARKED
1112-128138-0014 A WILFUL ABDICATION OF HALF THE POWER AND HALF THE CHARM OF VERSE AND WE CANNOT SAY THAT MISTER TODHUNTER HAS GIVEN US MUCH THAT CONSOLES US FOR ITS LOSS PART OF HIS POEM READS LIKE A TRANSLATION OF AN OLD BARDIC SONG
1112-128138-0015 PART OF IT LIKE ROUGH MATERIAL FOR POETRY AND PART OF IT LIKE MISSHAPEN PROSE IT IS AN INTERESTING SPECIMEN OF POETIC WRITING BUT IT IS NOT A PERFECT WORK OF ART
1112-128138-0016 THE DOOM OF THE CHILDREN OF LIR AND THE LAMENTATION FOR THE SONS OF TURANN RHYME GIVES ARCHITECTURE AS WELL AS MELODY TO SONG
1112-128138-0017 AND THOUGH THE LOVELY LUTE BUILDED WALLS OF THEBES MAY HAVE RISEN UP TO UNRHYMED CHORAL METRES WE HAVE HAD NO MODERN AMPHION TO WORK SUCH WONDERS FOR US
1112-128138-0018 FIVE WERE THE CHIEFS WHO CHALLENGED BY THEIR DEEDS THE OVER KINGSHIP
1112-128138-0019 AND AFTER THEM STOOD UP MIDHIR THE PROUD WHO REIGNED UPON THE HILLS OF BRI OF BRI THE LOVED OF LIATH BRI OF THE BROKEN HEART AND LAST WAS ANGUS OG ALL THESE HAD MANY VOICES BUT FOR BOV DERG WERE MOST
1112-128138-0020 HAS OF COURSE AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTEREST BUT HAS NO ARTISTIC VALUE AT ALL INDEED FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ART THE FEW LITTLE POEMS AT THE END OF THE VOLUME ARE WORTH ALL THE AMBITIOUS
1112-128138-0021 PSEUDO EPICS THAT MISTER TODHUNTER HAS TRIED TO CONSTRUCT OUT OF CELTIC LORE A BACCHIC DAY IS CHARMING AND THE SONNET ON THE OPEN AIR PERFORMANCE OF THE FAITHFULL SHEPHERDESSE
1112-128138-0022 IS MOST GRACEFULLY PHRASED AND MOST HAPPY IN CONCEPTION MISTER PEACOCK IS AN AMERICAN POET AND PROFESSOR THOMAS DANLEIGH SUPPLEE A M PH D F R S
1112-128138-0023 WHO HAS WRITTEN A PREFACE TO HIS POEMS OF THE PLAINS AND SONGS OF THE SOLITUDES TELLS US THAT HE IS ENTITLED TO BE CALLED THE LAUREATE OF THE WEST THOUGH A STAUNCH REPUBLICAN MISTER PEACOCK ACCORDING TO THE ENTHUSIASTIC PROFESSOR
1112-128138-0024 IS NOT ASHAMED OF HIS ANCESTOR KING WILLIAM OF HOLLAND NOR OF HIS RELATIVES LORD AND LADY PEACOCK WHO IT SEEMS ARE NATIVES OF SCOTLAND
1112-128138-0025 WHERE HIS FATHER EDITED THE ZANESVILLE AURORA AND HE HAD AN UNCLE WHO WAS A SUPERIOR MAN AND EDITED THE WHEELING INTELLIGENCER HIS POEMS SEEM TO BE EXTREMELY POPULAR AND HAVE BEEN HIGHLY PRAISED
1112-128138-0027 THE MANIAC THE BANDIT CHIEF AND THE OUTLAW CAN HARDLY BE CALLED LIGHT READING BUT WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE POEM ON CHICAGO CHICAGO GREAT CITY OF THE WEST ALL THAT WEALTH ALL THAT POWER INVEST
1112-128138-0028 THOU SPRANG LIKE MAGIC FROM THE SAND AS TOUCHED BY THE MAGICIAN'S WAND THOU SPRANG IS SLIGHTLY DEPRESSING AND THE SECOND LINE IS RATHER OBSCURE
1112-128138-0029 BUT WE SHOULD NOT MEASURE BY TOO HIGH A STANDARD THE UNTUTORED UTTERANCES OF ARTLESS NATURE THE OPENING LINES OF THE VENDETTA ALSO DESERVE MENTION WHEN STARS ARE GLOWING THROUGH DAY'S GLOAMING GLOW
1112-128138-0030 REFLECTING FROM OCEAN'S DEEP MIGHTY FLOW AT TWILIGHT WHEN NO GRIM SHADOWS OF NIGHT LIKE GHOULS HAVE STALKED IN WAKE OF THE LIGHT THE FIRST LINE IS CERTAINLY A MASTERPIECE AND INDEED THE WHOLE VOLUME IS FULL OF GEMS OF THIS KIND
1112-128138-0031 THE PROFESSOR REMARKS IN HIS ELABORATE PREFACE THAT MISTER PEACOCK FREQUENTLY RISES TO THE SUBLIME AND THE TWO PASSAGES QUOTED ABOVE SHOW HOW KEENLY CRITICAL IS HIS TASTE IN THESE MATTERS AND HOW WELL THE POET DESERVES HIS PANEGYRIC
1112-128138-0032 MISTER ALEXANDER SKENE SMITH'S HOLIDAY RECREATIONS AND OTHER POEMS IS HERALDED BY A PREFACE FOR WHICH PRINCIPAL CAIRNS IS RESPONSIBLE
1112-128138-0033 PRINCIPAL CAIRNS CLAIMS THAT THE LIFE STORY ENSHRINED IN MISTER SMITH'S POEMS SHOWS THE WIDE DIFFUSION OF NATIVE FIRE AND LITERARY CULTURE IN ALL PARTS OF SCOTLAND HAPPILY UNDER HIGHER AUSPICES THAN THOSE OF MERE POETIC IMPULSE
1112-128138-0034 THIS IS HARDLY A VERY FELICITOUS WAY OF INTRODUCING A POET NOR CAN WE SAY THAT MISTER SMITH'S POEMS ARE DISTINGUISHED BY EITHER FIRE OR CULTURE HE HAS A PLACID PLEASANT WAY OF WRITING AND INDEED HIS VERSES CANNOT DO ANY HARM
1112-128138-0035 THOUGH HE REALLY SHOULD NOT PUBLISH SUCH ATTEMPTS AT METRICAL VERSIONS OF THE PSALMS AS THE FOLLOWING A SEPTUAGENARIAN WE FREQUENTLY MAY SEE AN OCTOGENARIAN IF ONE SHOULD LIVE TO BE HE IS A BURDEN TO HIMSELF WITH WEARINESS AND WOE
1112-128138-0036 AND SOON HE DIES AND OFF HE FLIES AND LEAVETH ALL BELOW THE LITERARY CULTURE THAT PRODUCED THESE LINES IS WE FEAR NOT OF A VERY HIGH ORDER
1112-128138-0037 I STUDY POETRY SIMPLY AS A FINE ART BY WHICH I MAY EXERCISE MY INTELLECT AND ELEVATE MY TASTE WROTE THE LATE MISTER GEORGE MORINE MANY YEARS AGO TO A FRIEND
1112-128138-0038 ONE OF THE SONNETS THAT ENTITLED SUNSET APPEARED IN MISTER WADDINGTON'S ANTHOLOGY ABOUT TEN YEARS AFTER MISTER MORINE'S DEATH BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT HIS COLLECTED POEMS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED THEY ARE OFTEN DISTINGUISHED BY A GRAVE AND CHASTENED
1112-128138-0039 BEAUTY OF STYLE AND THEIR SOLEMN CADENCES HAVE SOMETHING OF THE GRAND MANNER ABOUT THEM THE EDITOR MISTER WILTON
1112-128138-0040 TO WHOM MISTER MORINE BEQUEATHED HIS MANUSCRIPTS SEEMS TO HAVE PERFORMED HIS TASK WITH GREAT TACT AND JUDGMENT AND WE HOPE THAT THIS LITTLE BOOK WILL MEET WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT IT DESERVES
1112-128138-0041 POEMS IN THE MODERN SPIRIT WITH THE SECRET OF CONTENT
1121-132777-0000 DURING JUNE THE MEETINGS OF THOSE WHO WERE IN THE SECRET WERE FREQUENT AT LENGTH ON THE LAST DAY OF THE MONTH THE DAY ON WHICH THE BISHOPS WERE PRONOUNCED NOT GUILTY THE DECISIVE STEP WAS TAKEN A FORMAL INVITATION TRANSCRIBED BY SIDNEY
1121-132777-0001 BUT DRAWN UP BY SOME PERSON MORE SKILLED THAN SIDNEY IN THE ART OF COMPOSITION WAS DESPATCHED TO THE HAGUE IN THIS PAPER WILLIAM WAS ASSURED THAT NINETEEN TWENTIETHS OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE WERE DESIROUS OF A CHANGE AND WOULD WILLINGLY JOIN TO EFFECT IT
1121-132777-0002 AS MIGHT SECURE THOSE WHO SHOULD RISE IN ARMS FROM THE DANGER OF BEING DISPERSED AND SLAUGHTERED BEFORE THEY COULD FORM THEMSELVES INTO ANYTHING LIKE MILITARY ORDER IF HIS HIGHNESS WOULD APPEAR IN THE ISLAND AT THE HEAD OF SOME TROOPS TENS OF THOUSANDS WOULD HASTEN TO HIS STANDARD
1121-132777-0003 HE WOULD SOON FIND HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF A FORCE GREATLY SUPERIOR TO THE WHOLE REGULAR ARMY OF ENGLAND NOR COULD THAT ARMY BE IMPLICITLY DEPENDED ON BY THE GOVERNMENT THE OFFICERS WERE DISCONTENTED
1121-132777-0004 AND THE COMMON SOLDIERS SHARED THAT AVERSION TO POPERY WHICH WAS GENERAL IN THE CLASS FROM WHICH THEY WERE TAKEN IN THE NAVY PROTESTANT FEELING WAS STILL STRONGER IT WAS IMPORTANT TO TAKE SOME DECISIVE STEP WHILE THINGS WERE IN THIS STATE
1121-132777-0005 ON ONE POINT THEY THOUGHT IT THEIR DUTY TO REMONSTRATE WITH HIS HIGHNESS HE HAD NOT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE OPINION WHICH THE GREAT BODY OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE HAD FORMED RESPECTING THE LATE BIRTH HE HAD ON THE CONTRARY SENT CONGRATULATIONS TO WHITEHALL
1121-132777-0006 AND HAD THUS SEEMED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CHILD WHO WAS CALLED PRINCE OF WALES WAS RIGHTFUL HEIR OF THE THRONE THIS WAS A GRAVE ERROR
1121-132777-0007 HIS ERRAND WAS ONE OF NO ORDINARY PERIL HE ASSUMED THE GARB OF A COMMON SAILOR AND IN THIS DISGUISE REACHED THE DUTCH COAST IN SAFETY ON THE FRIDAY AFTER THE TRIAL OF THE BISHOPS HE INSTANTLY HASTENED TO THE PRINCE
1121-132777-0008 AND WHAT IS MORE EXTRAORDINARY HE HAD WON HER ENTIRE AFFECTION HE WAS TO HER IN THE PLACE OF THE PARENTS WHOM SHE HAD LOST BY DEATH AND BY ESTRANGEMENT
1121-132777-0009 AND OF THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH SHE WAS BANISHED HIS EMPIRE OVER HER HEART WAS DIVIDED ONLY WITH HER GOD TO HER FATHER SHE HAD PROBABLY NEVER BEEN ATTACHED SHE HAD QUITTED HIM YOUNG MANY YEARS HAD ELAPSED SINCE SHE HAD SEEN HIM
1121-132777-0010 AND NO PART OF HIS CONDUCT TO HER SINCE HER MARRIAGE HAD INDICATED TENDERNESS ON HIS PART OR HAD BEEN CALCULATED TO CALL FORTH TENDERNESS ON HERS HE HAD DONE ALL IN HIS POWER TO DISTURB HER DOMESTIC HAPPINESS
1121-132777-0011 AND HAD ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF SPYING EAVESDROPPING
1121-132777-0012 WHO FOR REFUSING TO COMMIT AN ACT OF FLAGITIOUS INJUSTICE
1121-132777-0013 HE HAD CONSPIRED WITH TYRCONNEL AND WITH FRANCE AGAINST MARY'S RIGHTS AND HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR DEPRIVING HER OF ONE AT LEAST OF THE THREE CROWNS TO WHICH AT HIS DEATH
1121-132777-0014 IT WAS NOW BELIEVED BY THE GREAT BODY OF HIS PEOPLE AND BY MANY PERSONS HIGH IN RANK AND DISTINGUISHED BY ABILITIES THAT HE HAD INTRODUCED A SUPPOSITITIOUS PRINCE OF WALES INTO THE ROYAL FAMILY
1121-132777-0015 IN ORDER TO DEPRIVE HER OF A MAGNIFICENT INHERITANCE AND THERE IS NO REASON TO DOUBT THAT SHE PARTOOK OF THE PREVAILING SUSPICION THAT SHE SHOULD LOVE SUCH A FATHER WAS IMPOSSIBLE HER RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES INDEED
1121-132777-0016 AND INDEED ALL DIVINES AND PUBLICISTS AGREE IN THIS THAT WHEN THE DAUGHTER OF A PRINCE OF ONE COUNTRY IS MARRIED TO A PRINCE OF ANOTHER COUNTRY SHE IS BOUND TO FORGET HER OWN PEOPLE AND HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND
1121-132777-0017 IN THE EVENT OF A RUPTURE BETWEEN HER HUSBAND AND HER PARENTS TO SIDE WITH HER HUSBAND THIS IS THE UNDOUBTED RULE EVEN WHEN THE HUSBAND IS IN THE WRONG AND TO MARY THE ENTERPRISE WHICH WILLIAM MEDITATED APPEARED NOT ONLY JUST
1121-132777-0018 BUT HOLY BUT THOUGH SHE CAREFULLY ABSTAINED FROM DOING OR SAYING ANYTHING THAT COULD ADD TO HIS DIFFICULTIES THOSE DIFFICULTIES WERE SERIOUS INDEED THEY WERE IN TRUTH BUT IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD EVEN BY SOME OF THOSE WHO INVITED HIM OVER
1121-132777-0019 AND HAVE BEEN BUT IMPERFECTLY DESCRIBED BY SOME OF THOSE WHO HAVE WRITTEN THE HISTORY OF HIS EXPEDITION THE OBSTACLES WHICH HE MIGHT EXPECT TO ENCOUNTER ON ENGLISH GROUND THOUGH THE LEAST FORMIDABLE OF THE OBSTACLES WHICH STOOD IN THE WAY OF HIS DESIGN WERE YET SERIOUS
1121-132777-0020 HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE MADNESS IN HIM TO IMITATE THE EXAMPLE OF MONMOUTH TO CROSS THE SEA WITH A FEW BRITISH ADVENTURERS AND TO TRUST TO A GENERAL RISING OF THE POPULATION IT WAS NECESSARY
1121-132777-0021 AND IT WAS PRONOUNCED NECESSARY BY ALL THOSE WHO INVITED HIM OVER THAT HE SHOULD CARRY AN ARMY WITH HIM YET WHO COULD ANSWER FOR THE EFFECT WHICH THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH AN ARMY MIGHT PRODUCE THE GOVERNMENT WAS INDEED JUSTLY ODIOUS BUT WOULD THE ENGLISH PEOPLE
1121-132777-0022 ALTOGETHER UNACCUSTOMED TO THE INTERFERENCE OF CONTINENTAL POWERS IN ENGLISH DISPUTES BE INCLINED TO LOOK WITH FAVOUR ON A DELIVERER WHO WAS SURROUNDED BY FOREIGN SOLDIERS IF ANY PART OF THE ROYAL FORCES RESOLUTELY WITHSTOOD THE INVADERS
1121-132777-0023 WOULD NOT THAT PART SOON HAVE ON ITS SIDE THE PATRIOTIC SYMPATHY OF MILLIONS A DEFEAT WOULD BE FATAL TO THE WHOLE UNDERTAKING A BLOODY VICTORY GAINED IN THE HEART OF THE ISLAND BY THE MERCENARIES OF THE STATES GENERAL OVER THE COLDSTREAM GUARDS AND THE BUFFS
1121-132777-0024 WOULD BE ALMOST AS GREAT A CALAMITY AS A DEFEAT SUCH A VICTORY WOULD BE THE MOST CRUEL WOUND EVER INFLICTED ON THE NATIONAL PRIDE OF ONE OF THE PROUDEST OF NATIONS THE CROWN SO WON WOULD NEVER BE WORN IN PEACE OR SECURITY
1121-132777-0025 THE HATRED WITH WHICH THE HIGH COMMISSION AND THE JESUITS WERE REGARDED WOULD GIVE PLACE TO THE MORE INTENSE HATRED WHICH WOULD BE INSPIRED BY THE ALIEN CONQUERORS AND MANY WHO HAD HITHERTO CONTEMPLATED THE POWER OF FRANCE WITH DREAD AND LOATHING WOULD SAY THAT
1121-132777-0026 HAD BEEN AT HIS ABSOLUTE DISPOSAL BUT IN TRUTH IT SEEMED VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER HE WOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE ASSISTANCE OF A SINGLE BATTALION OF ALL THE DIFFICULTIES WITH WHICH HE HAD TO STRUGGLE THE GREATEST THOUGH LITTLE NOTICED BY ENGLISH HISTORIANS
1121-132777-0027 AROSE FROM THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BATAVIAN REPUBLIC NO GREAT SOCIETY HAS EVER EXISTED DURING A LONG COURSE OF YEARS UNDER A POLITY SO INCONVENIENT THE STATES GENERAL COULD NOT MAKE WAR OR PEACE
1121-132777-0029 EVERY MUNICIPALITY WAS IN SOME SENSE A SOVEREIGN STATE AND AS SUCH CLAIMED THE RIGHT OF COMMUNICATING DIRECTLY WITH FOREIGN AMBASSADORS AND OF CONCERTING WITH THEM THE MEANS OF DEFEATING SCHEMES ON WHICH OTHER MUNICIPALITIES WERE INTENT
1121-132777-0030 IN SOME TOWN COUNCILS THE PARTY WHICH HAD DURING SEVERAL GENERATIONS REGARDED THE INFLUENCE OF THE STADTHOLDERS WITH JEALOUSY HAD GREAT POWER AT THE HEAD OF THIS PARTY WERE THE MAGISTRATES OF THE NOBLE CITY OF AMSTERDAM
1121-132777-0031 WHICH WAS THEN AT THE HEIGHT OF PROSPERITY THEY HAD EVER SINCE THE PEACE OF NIMEGUEN KEPT UP A FRIENDLY CORRESPONDENCE WITH LEWIS
1121-132777-0032 PROPOSITIONS BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE STADTHOLDER AS INDISPENSABLE TO THE SECURITY OF THE COMMONWEALTH SANCTIONED BY ALL THE PROVINCES EXCEPT HOLLAND AND SANCTIONED BY SEVENTEEN OF THE EIGHTEEN TOWN COUNCILS OF HOLLAND HAD REPEATEDLY
1121-132777-0033 BEEN NEGATIVED BY THE SINGLE VOICE OF AMSTERDAM THE ONLY CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDY IN SUCH CASES WAS THAT DEPUTIES FROM THE CITIES WHICH WERE AGREED SHOULD PAY A VISIT TO THE CITY WHICH DISSENTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPOSTULATION
1121-135824-0000 NEITHER DID EITHER OF THEM FEEL LIKE MAKING THE LONG JOURNEY TO HIS HOME AND BACK AGAIN SO WHITEFOOT FOUND A HOLE IN A STUMP NEAR BY AND DECIDED TO CAMP OUT THERE FOR A FEW DAYS
1121-135824-0001 DANNY DECIDED TO DO THE SAME THING IN A COMFORTABLE PLACE UNDER A PILE OF BRUSH NOT FAR AWAY SO THE NEXT MORNING BOTH WERE ON HAND WHEN SCHOOL OPENED I TOLD YOU YESTERDAY THAT I WOULD TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF DANNY'S COUSINS
1121-135824-0002 BEGAN OLD MOTHER NATURE JUST AS CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL WHO WAS LATE CAME HURRYING UP QUITE OUT OF BREATH WAY UP IN THE FAR NORTH ARE TWO OF DANNY'S COUSINS MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO HIM THAN TO ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE MOUSE FAMILY
1121-135824-0003 WHO CHANGES THE COLOR OF HIS COAT IN SUMMER HE WEARS BEAUTIFUL SHADES OF REDDISH BROWN AND GRAY BUT IN WINTER HIS COAT IS WHOLLY WHITE HE IS ALSO CALLED THE HUDSON BAY LEMMING DANNY MEADOW MOUSE THINKS HIS TAIL IS SHORT
1121-135824-0004 THAT IS SO SHORT IT HARDLY SHOWS BEYOND HIS LONG FUR HE IS ABOUT DANNY'S SIZE BUT A LITTLE STOUTER AND STOCKIER AND HIS LONG FUR MAKES HIM APPEAR EVEN THICKER BODIED THAN HE REALLY IS
1121-135824-0005 HE HAS VERY SHORT LEGS AND HIS EARS ARE SO SMALL THAT THEY ARE QUITE HIDDEN IN THE FUR AROUND THEM
1121-135824-0006 IN THAT SAME FAR NORTHERN COUNTRY IS A CLOSE RELATIVE CALLED THE BROWN LEMMING HE IS VERY MUCH LIKE BANDY SAVE THAT HE IS ALL BROWN AND DOES NOT CHANGE HIS COAT IN WINTER
1121-135824-0007 BOTH HAVE THE SAME GENERAL HABITS AND THESE ARE MUCH LIKE THE HABITS OF DANNY MEADOW MOUSE THEY MAKE SHORT BURROWS IN THE GROUND LEADING TO SNUG WARM NESTS OF GRASS AND MOSS IN WINTER
1121-135824-0008 THEY MAKE LITTLE TUNNELS IN EVERY DIRECTION UNDER THE SNOW WITH NOW AND THEN AN OPENING TO THE SURFACE THERE ARE MANY MORE BROWN LEMMINGS THAN BANDED LEMMINGS AND THEIR LITTLE PATHS RUN EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE GRASS AND MOSS
1121-135824-0009 IN THAT COUNTRY THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF MOSS IT COVERS THE GROUND JUST AS GRASS DOES HERE BUT THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT THESE LEMMINGS IS THE WAY THEY MIGRATE
1121-135824-0010 TO MIGRATE IS TO MOVE FROM ONE PART OF THE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER YOU KNOW MOST OF THE BIRDS MIGRATE TO THE SUNNY SOUTH EVERY AUTUMN AND BACK EVERY SPRING
1121-135824-0011 THAT FOOD BECOMES VERY SCARCE WHERE THE LEMMINGS ARE THEN VERY MANY OF THEM GET TOGETHER JUST AS MIGRATING BIRDS FORM GREAT FLOCKS AND START ON A LONG JOURNEY IN SEARCH OF A PLACE WHERE THERE IS PLENTY OF FOOD
1121-135824-0012 THEY FORM A GREAT ARMY AND PUSH AHEAD REGARDLESS OF EVERYTHING THEY SWIM WIDE RIVERS AND EVEN LAKES WHICH MAY LIE IN THEIR WAY OF COURSE THEY EAT EVERYTHING EATABLE IN THEIR PATH
1121-135824-0013 I'M PERFECTLY SATISFIED TO LIVE RIGHT ON THE GREEN MEADOWS WHICH SHOWS YOUR GOOD COMMON SENSE SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE BY THE WAY DANNY I SUPPOSE YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH NIMBLEHEELS THE JUMPING MOUSE
1121-135824-0014 WHO ALSO IS RATHER FOND OF THE GREEN MEADOWS I OUGHT TO HAVE SENT WORD TO HIM TO BE HERE THIS MORNING HARDLY WERE THE WORDS OUT OF OLD MOTHER NATURE'S MOUTH WHEN SOMETHING LANDED IN THE LEAVES ALMOST AT HER FEET AND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF SCHOOL
1121-135824-0015 INSTANTLY DANNY MEADOW MOUSE SCURRIED UNDER A PILE OF DEAD LEAVES WHITEFOOT THE WOOD MOUSE DARTED INTO A KNOTHOLE IN THE LOG ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SITTING JUMPER THE HARE DODGED BEHIND A LITTLE HEMLOCK TREE
1121-135824-0016 PETER RABBIT BOLTED FOR A HOLLOW LOG STRIPED CHIPMUNK VANISHED IN A HOLE UNDER AN OLD STUMP JOHNNY CHUCK BACKED UP AGAINST THE TRUNK OF A TREE AND MADE READY TO FIGHT ONLY HAPPY JACK THE GRAY SQUIRREL
1121-135824-0017 AND CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL AND PRICKLY PORKY THE PORCUPINE WHO WERE SITTING IN TREES KEPT THEIR PLACES YOU SEE THEY FELT QUITE SAFE AS SOON AS ALL THOSE WHO HAD RUN HAD REACHED PLACES OF SAFETY
1121-135824-0018 THEY PEEPED OUT TO SEE WHAT HAD FRIGHTENED THEM SO JUST IMAGINE HOW VERY VERY FOOLISH THEY FELT WHEN THEY SAW OLD MOTHER NATURE SMILING DOWN AT A LITTLE FELLOW JUST ABOUT THE SIZE OF LITTLE WHITEFOOT BUT WITH A MUCH LONGER TAIL
1121-135824-0019 HER EYES TWINKLED NIMBLEHEELS SAW THIS AND KNEW THAT SHE WAS ONLY PRETENDING TO BE SEVERE BEFORE HE COULD REPLY JOHNNY CHUCK BEGAN TO CHUCKLE THE CHUCKLE BECAME A LAUGH AND PRESENTLY JOHNNY WAS LAUGHING SO HARD HE HAD TO HOLD HIS SIDES
1121-135824-0020 NOW AS YOU KNOW LAUGHTER IS CATCHING IN A MINUTE OR SO EVERYBODY WAS LAUGHING AND NO ONE BUT JOHNNY CHUCK KNEW WHAT THE JOKE WAS AT LAST PETER RABBIT STOPPED LAUGHING LONG ENOUGH TO ASK JOHNNY WHAT HE WAS LAUGHING AT
1121-135824-0021 GIVING US ALL SUCH A FRIGHT REPLIED JOHNNY CHUCK THEN ALL LAUGHED SOME MORE WHEN THEY WERE THROUGH LAUGHING NIMBLEHEELS ANSWERED OLD MOTHER NATURE'S QUESTIONS
1121-135824-0022 HE EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD HEARD ABOUT THAT SCHOOL AS BY THIS TIME ALMOST EVERY ONE IN THE GREEN FOREST AND ON THE GREEN MEADOWS HAD BY CHANCE HE LEARNED THAT DANNY MEADOW MOUSE WAS ATTENDING HE THOUGHT THAT IF IT WAS A GOOD THING FOR DANNY IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR HIM
1121-135824-0023 IT WAS SOME JUMP EXCLAIMED JUMPER THE HARE ADMIRINGLY
1121-135824-0024 IT ISN'T MUCH OF A JUMP TO GO OVER YOUR HEAD REPLIED NIMBLEHEELS
1121-135824-0025 I WASN'T HALF TRYING WHEN I LANDED HERE I'M SORRY I FRIGHTENED ALL OF YOU SO
1121-135824-0026 REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE HOP UP ON THAT LOG SIDE OF YOUR COUSIN WHITEFOOT WHERE ALL CAN SEE YOU NIMBLEHEELS HOPPED UP BESIDE WHITEFOOT THE WOOD MOUSE AND AS THE TWO LITTLE COUSINS SAT SIDE BY SIDE
1121-135824-0027 HIS EARS WERE MUCH SMALLER THAN THOSE OF WHITEFOOT BUT THE GREATEST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO WERE IN THEIR HIND LEGS AND TAILS THE HIND LEGS AND FEET OF NIMBLEHEELS WERE LONG
1121-135824-0028 ANY ONE WOULD KNOW THAT HE WAS A BORN JUMPER AND A GOOD ONE WHITEFOOT POSSESSED A LONG TAIL BUT THE TAIL OF NIMBLEHEELS WAS MUCH LONGER SLIM AND TAPERING THERE SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE IS THE GREATEST JUMPER
1121-135824-0029 FOR HIS SIZE AMONG ALL THE ANIMALS IN THIS GREAT COUNTRY WHEN I SAY THIS I MEAN THE GREATEST GROUND JUMPER
1121-135824-0030 BUT TIMMY HAS TO CLIMB TO A HIGH PLACE AND THEN COASTS DOWN ON THE AIR I TOLD YOU WHAT WONDERFUL JUMPS JACK RABBIT CAN MAKE BUT IF HE COULD JUMP AS HIGH AND FAR FOR HIS SIZE AS NIMBLEHEELS CAN JUMP FOR HIS SIZE
1121-135824-0031 THE LONGEST JUMP JACK HAS EVER MADE WOULD SEEM NOTHING MORE THAN A HOP BY THE WAY BOTH NIMBLEHEELS AND WHITEFOOT HAVE SMALL POCKETS IN THEIR CHEEKS TELL US WHERE YOU LIVE NIMBLEHEELS
1121-135824-0032 I LIVE AMONG THE WEEDS ALONG THE EDGE OF THE GREEN MEADOWS REPLIED NIMBLEHEELS
1121-135824-0033 BUT I LIKE BEST TO BE AMONG THE WEEDS BECAUSE THEY ARE TALL AND KEEP ME WELL HIDDEN

1121-176698-0014 I UNDERSTAND
1121-176698-0015 SAID ADAM AT THIS JUNCTURE SPEAKING FROM BENEATH AN INLAID TABLE WHICH HE HELD BALANCED UPON HIS HEAD IT AIN'T AS IF THIS WAS JEST ORDINARY FURNITUR SIR YE SEE SHE KIND ER FEELS AS IT BE ALL PART O DAPPLEMERE MANOR AS IT USED TO BE CALLED
1121-176698-0016 IT'S ALL BEEN HERE SO LONG THAT THEM CHEERS AN TABLES HAS COME TO BE PART O THE OUSE SIR SO WHEN SHE COMES AN FINDS AS IT AIN'T ALL BEEN TOOK
1121-176698-0017 OH LORD AND HERE ADAM GAVE VENT TO HIS GREAT LAUGH WHICH NECESSITATED AN ALMOST SUPERHUMAN EXERTION OF STRENGTH TO KEEP THE TABLE FROM SLIPPING FROM ITS PRECARIOUS PERCH WHEREUPON MISS PRISCILLA SCREAMED
1121-176698-0018 WHEN THE FLOOR HAD BEEN SWEPT OF ITS LITTER AND EVERY TRACE OF THE SALE REMOVED THEN MISS PRISCILLA SIGHED
1121-176698-0019 AND MAY COME THE LONGEST WAY ROUND YES IT'S IN MY MIND SHE WILL KEEP AWAY FROM DAPPLEMERE AS LONG AS EVER SHE CAN AND I THINK SAID BELLEW YES I THINK I'LL TAKE A WALK
1121-176698-0020 I'LL GO AND CALL UPON THE SERGEANT THE SERGEANT SAID MISS PRISCILLA LET ME SEE IT IS NOW A QUARTER TO SIX IT SHOULD TAKE YOU ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES TO THE VILLAGE THAT WILL MAKE IT EXACTLY SIX O'CLOCK
1121-176698-0021 YOU WILL FIND THE SERGEANT JUST SITTING DOWN IN THE CHAIR ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE FIRE PLACE IN THE CORNER AT THE KING'S HEAD YOU KNOW NOT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN HIM THERE GOOD GRACIOUS NO BUT I HAPPEN TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH HIS HABITS
1121-176698-0022 AND HE IS AS REGULAR AND PRECISE AS HIS GREAT BIG SILVER WATCH AND THAT IS THE MOST PRECISE AND REGULAR THING IN ALL THE WORLD I AM GLAD YOU ARE GOING SHE WENT ON BECAUSE TO DAY IS
1121-176698-0023 A DAY APART MISTER BELLEW YOU WILL FIND THE SERGEANT AT THE KING'S HEAD UNTIL HALF PAST SEVEN THEN I WILL GO TO THE KING'S HEAD SAID BELLEW AND WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU SEND HIM NONE
1121-176698-0024 SAID MISS PRISCILLA LAUGHING AND SHAKING HER HEAD AT LEAST YOU CAN TELL HIM IF YOU WISH THAT THE PEACHES ARE RIPER THAN EVER THEY WERE THIS EVENING I WON'T FORGET SAID BELLEW SMILING AND WENT OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE
1121-176698-0025 BUT CROSSING THE YARD HE WAS MET BY ADAM WHO CHUCKLING STILL PAUSED TO TOUCH HIS HAT TO LOOK AT THAT THEER ALL SIR YOU WOULDN'T NEVER KNOW AS THERE'D EVER BEEN ANY SALE AT ALL NOT NO'OW
1121-176698-0026 NOW THE ONLY QUESTION AS WORRITS ME
1121-176698-0027 YES SAID BELLEW I WONDER
1121-176698-0028 MISS PRISCILLA HAD BEEN RIGHT
1121-176698-0029 ALSO SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO KEEP AWAY FROM DAPPLEMERE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE THEREFORE DESPITE SMALL PORGES EXHORTATIONS AND BESS'S CHAMPING IMPATIENCE
1121-176698-0030 PERMITTING HER ONLY THE SLOWEST OF PACES WHICH WAS A MOST UNUSUAL THING FOR ANTHEA TO DO FOR THE MOST PART TOO
1121-176698-0031 WHICH WAS ALSO VERY UNLIKE IN HER BUT BEFORE HER EYES WERE VISIONS OF HER DISMANTLED HOME IN HER EARS WAS THE ROAR OF VOICES CLAMOURING FOR HER CHERISHED POSSESSIONS A SICKENING ROAR BROKEN NOW AND THEN
1121-176698-0032 BY THE HOLLOW TAP OF THE AUCTIONEER'S CRUEL HAMMER AND EACH TIME THE CLAMOURING VOICES ROSE SHE SHIVERED AND EVERY BLOW OF THE CRUEL HAMMER SEEMED TO FALL UPON HER QUIVERING HEART
1121-176698-0033 THUS SHE WAS UNWONTEDLY DEAF AND UNRESPONSIVE TO SMALL PORGES WHO PRESENTLY FELL INTO A PROFOUND GLOOM IN CONSEQUENCE AND THUS SHE HELD IN THE EAGER MARE WHO THEREFORE SHIED AND FIDGETED
1121-176698-0034 AND TOSSED HER HEAD INDIGNANTLY BUT SLOWLY AS THEY WENT THEY CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE AT LAST WITH ITS QUAINT GABLES AND MANY LATTICED WINDOWS AND THE BLUE SMOKE CURLING UP FROM ITS TWISTED CHIMNEYS
1121-176698-0035 SMILING AND PLACID AS THOUGH IN ALL THIS GREAT WORLD THERE WERE NO SUCH THING TO BE FOUND AS AN AUCTIONEER'S HAMMER AND PRESENTLY THEY SWUNG INTO THE DRIVE AND DREW UP IN THE COURTYARD AND THERE WAS ADAM
1121-176698-0036 ANTHEA CLIMBED DOWN FROM THE HIGH DOG CART AIDING SMALL PORGES TO EARTH AND WITH HIS HAND CLASPED TIGHT IN HERS AND WITH LIPS SET FIRM SHE TURNED AND ENTERED THE HALL BUT UPON THE THRESHOLD SHE STOPPED
1121-176698-0037 AND STOOD THERE UTTERLY STILL GAZING AND GAZING UPON THE TRIM ORDERLINESS OF EVERYTHING THEN SEEING EVERY WELL REMEMBERED THING IN ITS APPOINTED PLACE ALL BECAME SUDDENLY BLURRED AND DIM
1121-176698-0038 SHE UTTERED A GREAT CHOKING SOB AND COVERED HER FACE BUT SMALL PORGES HAD SEEN AND STOOD AGHAST AND MISS PRISCILLA HAD SEEN AND NOW HURRIED FORWARD WITH A QUICK TAP TAP OF HER STICK
1121-176698-0039 AND LOOKED FOR ONE WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE BUT WAS NOT AND IN THAT MOMENT INSTINCTIVELY SHE KNEW HOW THINGS CAME TO BE AS THEY WERE AND BECAUSE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE HER CHEEKS FLAMED WITH A SWIFT BURNING COLOUR
1121-176698-0040 AND WITH A SOFT CRY SHE HID HER FACE IN MISS PRISCILLA'S GENTLE BOSOM THEN WHILE HER FACE WAS YET HIDDEN THERE SHE WHISPERED TELL ME TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT BUT MEANWHILE BELLEW
1121-176698-0041 STRIDING FAR AWAY ACROSS THE MEADOWS SEEMING TO WATCH THE GLORY OF THE SUN SET AND TO HEARKEN TO A BLACKBIRD PIPING FROM THE DIM SECLUSION OF THE COPSE A MELODIOUS GOOD BYE TO THE DYING DAY YET SAW AND HEARD IT NOT AT ALL
1160-134674-0000 WHO THEN RESIDED AT TREVES WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THE CALAMITIES OF ILLYRICUM BUT THE LATENESS OF THE SEASON SUSPENDED THE EXECUTION OF HIS DESIGNS TILL THE ENSUING SPRING HE MARCHED IN PERSON
1160-134674-0001 HE SHOULD EXAMINE AND PRONOUNCE WHEN HE ARRIVED AT SIRMIUM HE GAVE AUDIENCE TO THE DEPUTIES
1160-134674-0002 WAS INCAPABLE OF THE MAGNANIMITY WHICH DARES TO ACKNOWLEDGE A FAULT HE FORGOT THE PROVOCATION REMEMBERED ONLY THE INJURY AND ADVANCED INTO THE COUNTRY OF THE QUADI
1160-134674-0003 AND DEJECTED COUNTENANCES AND WITHOUT DARING TO COMPLAIN OF THE MURDER OF THEIR KING THEY AFFIRMED WITH SOLEMN OATHS THAT THE LATE INVASION WAS THE CRIME OF SOME IRREGULAR ROBBERS WHICH THE PUBLIC COUNCIL OF THE NATION CONDEMNED AND ABHORRED
1160-134674-0004 THE ANSWER OF THE EMPEROR LEFT THEM
1160-134674-0005 FROM THE EVIDENCE OF REASON AS WELL AS HISTORY THAT THE TWO MARRIAGES OF VALENTINIAN WITH SEVERA AND WITH JUSTINA WERE SUCCESSIVELY CONTRACTED AND THAT HE USED THE ANCIENT PERMISSION OF DIVORCE WHICH WAS STILL ALLOWED BY THE LAWS THOUGH IT WAS CONDEMNED BY THE CHURCH
1160-134674-0006 WHO SEEMED TO UNITE EVERY CLAIM WHICH COULD ENTITLE HIM TO THE UNDOUBTED SUCCESSION OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE HE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A MONARCH WHOSE GLORIOUS REIGN HAD CONFIRMED THE FREE AND HONORABLE CHOICE OF HIS FELLOW SOLDIERS
1160-134674-0007 BEFORE HE HAD ATTAINED THE NINTH YEAR OF HIS AGE THE ROYAL YOUTH RECEIVED FROM THE HANDS OF HIS INDULGENT FATHER THE PURPLE ROBE AND DIADEM
1160-134674-0008 THE FAVORABLE OPINION OF THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE
1160-134674-0009 IMMEDIATELY REVIVED IN THE IMPERIAL COUNCIL AND THE AMBITIOUS DESIGN OF REIGNING IN THE NAME OF AN INFANT WAS ARTFULLY EXECUTED BY
1160-134674-0010 AND EQUITIUS WHO COMMANDED THE ATTACHMENT OF THE ILLYRIAN AND ITALIAN BANDS THEY CONTRIVED THE MOST HONORABLE PRETENCES
1160-134674-0011 AND THE TROOPS OF GAUL WHO MIGHT HAVE ASSERTED THE CLAIMS OF THE LAWFUL SUCCESSOR THEY SUGGESTED THE NECESSITY OF EXTINGUISHING THE HOPES OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC ENEMIES BY A BOLD AND DECISIVE MEASURE THE EMPRESS JUSTINA
1160-134674-0012 WHO HAD BEEN LEFT IN A PALACE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES FROM BREGETIO WAS RESPECTIVELY INVITED TO APPEAR IN THE CAMP WITH THE SON OF THE DECEASED EMPEROR ON THE SIXTH DAY AFTER THE DEATH OF VALENTINIAN THE INFANT PRINCE OF THE SAME NAME
1160-134674-0013 WHO WAS ONLY FOUR YEARS OLD WAS SHOWN IN THE ARMS OF HIS MOTHER TO THE LEGIONS AND SOLEMNLY INVESTED BY MILITARY ACCLAMATION
1160-134674-0014 WERE SEASONABLY PREVENTED BY THE WISE AND MODERATE CONDUCT OF THE EMPEROR GRATIAN HE CHEERFULLY ACCEPTED THE CHOICE OF THE ARMY
1160-134674-0015 AS A BROTHER NOT AS A RIVAL AND ADVISED THE EMPRESS WITH HER SON VALENTINIAN TO FIX THEIR RESIDENCE AT MILAN IN THE FAIR AND PEACEFUL PROVINCE OF ITALY WHILE HE ASSUMED THE MORE ARDUOUS COMMAND OF THE COUNTRIES BEYOND THE ALPS
1160-134674-0016 DISSEMBLED HIS RESENTMENT TILL HE COULD SAFELY PUNISH OR DISGRACE THE AUTHORS OF THE CONSPIRACY AND THOUGH HE UNIFORMLY BEHAVED WITH TENDERNESS AND REGARD TO HIS INFANT COLLEAGUE HE GRADUALLY CONFOUNDED
1160-134674-0017 IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE THE OFFICE OF A GUARDIAN WITH THE AUTHORITY OF A SOVEREIGN
1160-139336-0000 THE LAST A PUNISHER SOCIETY IN EVERY STATE IS A BLESSING BUT GOVERNMENT EVEN IN ITS BEST STATE IS BUT A NECESSARY EVIL IN ITS WORST STATE AN INTOLERABLE ONE FOR WHEN WE SUFFER OR ARE EXPOSED TO THE SAME MISERIES
1160-139336-0001 BY A GOVERNMENT WHICH WE MIGHT EXPECT IN A COUNTRY WITHOUT GOVERNMENT OUR CALAMITY IS HEIGHTENED BY REFLECTING THAT WE FURNISH THE MEANS BY WHICH WE SUFFER GOVERNMENT LIKE DRESS IS THE BADGE OF LOST INNOCENCE
1160-139336-0002 THE PALACES OF KINGS ARE BUILT ON THE RUINS OF THE BOWERS OF PARADISE
1160-139336-0003 UNIFORM AND IRRESISTIBLY OBEYED MAN WOULD NEED NO OTHER LAWGIVER BUT THAT NOT BEING THE CASE HE FINDS IT NECESSARY TO SURRENDER UP A PART OF HIS PROPERTY TO FURNISH MEANS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE REST
1160-139336-0004 AND THIS HE IS INDUCED TO DO BY THE SAME PRUDENCE WHICH IN EVERY OTHER CASE ADVISES HIM OUT OF TWO EVILS TO CHOOSE THE LEAST WHEREFORE SECURITY BEING THE TRUE DESIGN AND END OF GOVERNMENT IT UNANSWERABLY FOLLOWS
1160-139336-0005 THAT WHATEVER FORM THEREOF APPEARS MOST LIKELY TO ENSURE IT TO US WITH THE LEAST EXPENCE AND GREATEST BENEFIT IS PREFERABLE TO ALL OTHERS IN ORDER TO GAIN A CLEAR AND JUST IDEA OF THE DESIGN AND END OF GOVERNMENT
1160-139336-0006 LET US SUPPOSE A SMALL NUMBER OF PERSONS SETTLED IN SOME SEQUESTERED PART OF THE EARTH UNCONNECTED WITH THE REST
1160-139336-0007 OR OF THE WORLD IN THIS STATE OF NATURAL LIBERTY SOCIETY WILL BE THEIR FIRST THOUGHT
1160-139336-0008 THE STRENGTH OF ONE MAN IS SO UNEQUAL TO HIS WANTS
1160-139336-0009 THAT HE IS SOON OBLIGED TO SEEK ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF OF ANOTHER WHO IN HIS TURN REQUIRES THE SAME FOUR OR FIVE UNITED WOULD BE ABLE TO RAISE A TOLERABLE DWELLING IN THE MIDST OF A WILDERNESS
1160-139336-0010 WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHING ANY THING WHEN HE HAD FELLED HIS TIMBER HE COULD NOT REMOVE IT NOR ERECT IT AFTER IT WAS REMOVED HUNGER IN THE MEAN TIME WOULD URGE HIM FROM HIS WORK AND EVERY DIFFERENT WANT
1160-139336-0011 CALL HIM A DIFFERENT WAY DISEASE NAY EVEN MISFORTUNE WOULD BE DEATH FOR THOUGH NEITHER MIGHT BE MORTAL YET EITHER WOULD DISABLE HIM FROM LIVING AND REDUCE HIM TO A STATE IN WHICH HE MIGHT RATHER BE SAID TO PERISH THAN TO DIE
1160-139336-0012 WHILE THEY REMAINED PERFECTLY JUST TO EACH OTHER BUT AS NOTHING BUT HEAVEN IS IMPREGNABLE TO VICE IT WILL UNAVOIDABLY HAPPEN THAT IN PROPORTION AS THEY SURMOUNT THE FIRST DIFFICULTIES OF EMIGRATION WHICH BOUND THEM TOGETHER IN A COMMON CAUSE
1160-139336-0013 THEY WILL BEGIN TO RELAX IN THEIR DUTY AND ATTACHMENT TO EACH OTHER AND THIS REMISSNESS WILL POINT OUT THE NECESSITY OF ESTABLISHING SOME FORM OF GOVERNMENT TO SUPPLY THE DEFECT OF MORAL VIRTUE SOME CONVENIENT TREE WILL AFFORD THEM A STATE HOUSE
1160-139336-0014 UNDER THE BRANCHES OF WHICH THE WHOLE COLONY MAY ASSEMBLE TO DELIBERATE ON PUBLIC MATTERS IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THEIR FIRST LAWS WILL HAVE THE TITLE ONLY OF REGULATIONS AND BE ENFORCED BY NO OTHER PENALTY
1160-139336-0015 IN THIS FIRST PARLIAMENT EVERY MAN BY NATURAL RIGHT WILL HAVE A SEAT BUT AS THE COLONY INCREASES THE PUBLIC CONCERNS WILL INCREASE LIKEWISE AND THE DISTANCE AT WHICH THE MEMBERS MAY BE SEPARATED
1160-139336-0016 WILL RENDER IT TOO INCONVENIENT FOR ALL OF THEM TO MEET ON EVERY OCCASION AS AT FIRST WHEN THEIR NUMBER WAS SMALL THEIR HABITATIONS NEAR AND THE PUBLIC CONCERNS FEW AND TRIFLING
1160-139336-0017 TO BE MANAGED BY A SELECT NUMBER CHOSEN FROM THE WHOLE BODY WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AT STAKE WHICH THOSE HAVE WHO APPOINTED THEM AND WHO WILL ACT IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE WHOLE BODY WOULD ACT WERE THEY PRESENT
1160-139336-0018 EACH PART SENDING ITS PROPER NUMBER AND THAT THE ELECTED MIGHT NEVER FORM TO THEMSELVES AN INTEREST SEPARATE FROM THE ELECTORS PRUDENCE WILL POINT OUT THE PROPRIETY OF HAVING ELECTIONS OFTEN BECAUSE AS THE ELECTED
1160-139336-0019 AND AS THIS FREQUENT INTERCHANGE WILL ESTABLISH A COMMON INTEREST WITH EVERY PART OF THE COMMUNITY THEY WILL MUTUALLY AND NATURALLY SUPPORT EACH OTHER AND ON THIS NOT ON THE UNMEANING NAME OF KING DEPENDS THE STRENGTH OF GOVERNMENT
1160-139336-0020 AND THE HAPPINESS OF THE GOVERNED HERE THEN IS THE ORIGIN AND RISE OF GOVERNMENT NAMELY A MODE RENDERED NECESSARY BY THE INABILITY OF MORAL VIRTUE TO GOVERN THE WORLD HERE TOO IS THE DESIGN AND END OF GOVERNMENT VIZ
1160-139336-0021 FREEDOM AND SECURITY AND HOWEVER OUR EYES MAY BE DAZZLED WITH SNOW OR OUR EARS DECEIVED BY SOUND HOWEVER PREJUDICE MAY WARP OUR WILLS OR INTEREST DARKEN OUR UNDERSTANDING THE SIMPLE VOICE OF NATURE AND OF REASON WILL SAY IT IS RIGHT
1160-139336-0022 FROM A PRINCIPLE IN NATURE WHICH NO ART CAN OVERTURN VIZ THAT THE MORE SIMPLE ANY THING IS THE LESS LIABLE IT IS TO BE DISORDERED AND THE EASIER REPAIRED WHEN DISORDERED
1160-139336-0023 AND WITH THIS MAXIM IN VIEW I OFFER A FEW REMARKS ON THE SO MUCH BOASTED CONSTITUTION OF ENGLAND
1160-139336-0024 IN WHICH IT WAS ERECTED IS GRANTED WHEN THE WORLD WAS OVER RUN WITH TYRANNY THE LEAST REMOVE THEREFROM WAS A GLORIOUS RESCUE BUT THAT IT IS IMPERFECT SUBJECT TO CONVULSIONS AND INCAPABLE OF PRODUCING WHAT IT SEEMS TO PROMISE
1160-139336-0025 IS EASILY DEMONSTRATED ABSOLUTE GOVERNMENTS THO THE DISGRACE OF HUMAN NATURE HAVE THIS ADVANTAGE WITH THEM THAT THEY ARE SIMPLE IF THE PEOPLE SUFFER THEY KNOW THE HEAD FROM WHICH THEIR SUFFERING SPRINGS KNOW LIKEWISE THE REMEDY
1160-139336-0026 AND EVERY POLITICAL PHYSICIAN WILL ADVISE A DIFFERENT MEDICINE I KNOW IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET OVER LOCAL OR LONG STANDING PREJUDICES YET IF WE WILL SUFFER OURSELVES TO EXAMINE THE COMPONENT PARTS OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION
1160-139336-0027 WE SHALL FIND THEM TO BE THE BASE REMAINS OF TWO ANCIENT TYRANNIES COMPOUNDED WITH SOME NEW REPUBLICAN MATERIALS FIRST THE REMAINS OF MONARCHICAL TYRANNY IN THE PERSON OF THE KING SECONDLY THE REMAINS OF ARISTOCRATICAL TYRANNY
1160-139336-0028 IN THE PERSONS OF THE PEERS THIRDLY THE NEW REPUBLICAN MATERIALS IN THE PERSONS OF THE COMMONS ON WHOSE VIRTUE DEPENDS THE FREEDOM OF ENGLAND THE TWO FIRST BY BEING HEREDITARY ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE PEOPLE
1160-139336-0029 CONSTITUTIONAL SENSE THEY CONTRIBUTE NOTHING TOWARDS THE FREEDOM OF THE STATE TO SAY THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF ENGLAND IS A UNION OF THREE POWERS RECIPROCALLY CHECKING EACH OTHER IS FARCICAL EITHER THE WORDS HAVE NO MEANING OR THEY ARE
1160-139336-0030 SECONDLY THAT THE COMMONS BY BEING APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE ARE EITHER WISER OR MORE WORTHY OF CONFIDENCE THAN THE CROWN BUT AS THE SAME CONSTITUTION WHICH GIVES THE COMMONS A POWER TO CHECK THE KING BY WITHHOLDING THE SUPPLIES
1160-139336-0031 GIVES AFTERWARDS THE KING A POWER TO CHECK THE COMMONS BY EMPOWERING HIM TO REJECT THEIR OTHER BILLS IT AGAIN SUPPOSES THAT THE KING IS WISER THAN THOSE WHOM IT HAS ALREADY SUPPOSED TO BE WISER THAN HIM A MERE ABSURDITY
1160-139336-0032 THERE IS SOMETHING EXCEEDINGLY RIDICULOUS IN THE COMPOSITION OF MONARCHY IT FIRST EXCLUDES A MAN FROM THE MEANS OF INFORMATION YET EMPOWERS HIM TO ACT IN CASES WHERE THE HIGHEST JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED THE STATE OF A KING SHUTS HIM FROM THE WORLD
1160-139336-0033 YET THE BUSINESS OF A KING REQUIRES HIM TO KNOW IT THOROUGHLY WHEREFORE THE DIFFERENT PARTS BY UNNATURALLY OPPOSING AND DESTROYING EACH OTHER PROVE THE WHOLE CHARACTER TO BE ABSURD AND USELESS SOME WRITERS HAVE EXPLAINED THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION THUS
1160-139336-0034 THE PEOPLE ANOTHER THE PEERS ARE AN HOUSE IN BEHALF OF THE KING THE COMMONS IN BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE BUT THIS HATH ALL THE DISTINCTIONS OF AN HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF AND THOUGH THE EXPRESSIONS BE PLEASANTLY ARRANGED
1160-139336-0035 YET WHEN EXAMINED THEY APPEAR IDLE AND AMBIGUOUS AND IT WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN THAT THE NICEST CONSTRUCTION THAT WORDS ARE CAPABLE OF WHEN APPLIED TO THE DESCRIPTION OF SOME THING WHICH EITHER CANNOT EXIST OR IS TOO INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO BE WITHIN THE COMPASS OF DESCRIPTION
1160-139336-0036 OR AS THE PHRASE IS CHECK THE RAPIDITY OF ITS MOTION YET SO LONG AS THEY CANNOT STOP IT THEIR ENDEAVORS WILL BE INEFFECTUAL THE FIRST MOVING POWER WILL AT LAST HAVE ITS WAY AND WHAT IT WANTS IN SPEED IS SUPPLIED BY TIME
1160-139336-0037 THAT THE CROWN IS THIS OVERBEARING PART IN THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION NEEDS NOT BE MENTIONED AND THAT IT DERIVES ITS WHOLE CONSEQUENCE MERELY FROM BEING THE GIVER OF PLACES AND PENSIONS IS SELF EVIDENT WHEREFORE
1160-139336-0038 THOUGH WE HAVE BEEN WISE ENOUGH TO SHUT AND LOCK A DOOR AGAINST ABSOLUTE MONARCHY WE AT THE SAME TIME HAVE BEEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO PUT THE CROWN IN POSSESSION OF THE KEY THE PREJUDICE OF ENGLISHMEN IN FAVOUR OF THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT BY KING LORDS AND COMMONS
1160-139336-0039 IT IS HANDED TO THE PEOPLE UNDER THE MORE FORMIDABLE SHAPE OF AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT FOR THE FATE OF CHARLES THE FIRST HATH ONLY MADE KINGS MORE SUBTLE NOT MORE JUST
1160-139717-0000 EARLY FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA KEIMER AND I LIV'D ON A PRETTY GOOD FAMILIAR FOOTING AND AGREED TOLERABLY WELL FOR HE SUSPECTED NOTHING OF MY SETTING UP
1160-139717-0001 HE RETAINED A GREAT DEAL OF HIS OLD ENTHUSIASMS AND LOV'D ARGUMENTATION WE THEREFORE HAD MANY DISPUTATIONS I USED TO WORK HIM SO WITH MY SOCRATIC METHOD
1160-139717-0002 SO DISTANT FROM ANY POINT WE HAD IN HAND AND YET BY DEGREES LED TO THE POINT AND BROUGHT HIM INTO DIFFICULTIES AND CONTRADICTIONS THAT AT LAST HE GREW RIDICULOUSLY CAUTIOUS
1160-139717-0003 THE MOST COMMON QUESTION WITHOUT ASKING FIRST
1160-139717-0004 HOWEVER IT GAVE HIM SO HIGH AN OPINION OF MY ABILITIES IN THE CONFUTING WAY THAT HE SERIOUSLY PROPOSED MY BEING HIS COLLEAGUE IN A PROJECT HE HAD OF SETTING UP A NEW SECT HE WAS TO PREACH THE DOCTRINES AND I WAS TO CONFOUND ALL OPPONENTS
1160-139717-0005 WHEN HE CAME TO EXPLAIN WITH ME UPON THE DOCTRINES I FOUND SEVERAL CONUNDRUMS WHICH I OBJECTED TO UNLESS I MIGHT HAVE MY WAY A LITTLE TOO AND INTRODUCE SOME OF MINE KEIMER WORE HIS BEARD AT FULL LENGTH BECAUSE
1160-139717-0006 BUT AGREED TO ADMIT THEM UPON CONDITION OF HIS ADOPTING THE DOCTRINE OF USING NO ANIMAL FOOD I DOUBT SAID HE MY CONSTITUTION WILL NOT BEAR THAT I ASSUR'D HIM IT WOULD
1160-139717-0007 HE WAS USUALLY A GREAT GLUTTON AND I PROMISED MYSELF SOME DIVERSION IN HALF STARVING HIM HE AGREED TO TRY THE PRACTICE IF I WOULD KEEP HIM COMPANY I DID SO AND WE HELD IT FOR THREE MONTHS
1160-139717-0008 WE HAD OUR VICTUALS DRESS'D AND BROUGHT TO US REGULARLY BY A WOMAN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO HAD FROM ME A LIST OF FORTY DISHES TO BE PREPAR'D FOR US AT DIFFERENT TIMES
1160-139717-0009 I HAVE SINCE KEPT SEVERAL LENTS MOST STRICTLY LEAVING THE COMMON DIET FOR THAT AND THAT FOR THE COMMON ABRUPTLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INCONVENIENCE
1160-139717-0010 SUFFERED GRIEVOUSLY TIRED OF THE PROJECT LONG'D FOR THE FLESH POTS OF EGYPT AND ORDER'D A ROAST PIG HE INVITED ME AND TWO WOMEN FRIENDS TO DINE WITH HIM BUT IT BEING BROUGHT TOO SOON UPON TABLE
1160-139717-0011 HE COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION AND ATE THE WHOLE BEFORE WE CAME
1160-139717-0012 DURING THIS TIME TO MISS READ I HAD A GREAT RESPECT AND AFFECTION FOR HER AND HAD SOME REASON TO BELIEVE SHE HAD THE SAME FOR ME BUT AS I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE A LONG VOYAGE AND WE WERE BOTH VERY YOUNG ONLY A LITTLE ABOVE EIGHTEEN
1160-139717-0013 IT WAS THOUGHT MOST PRUDENT BY HER MOTHER TO PREVENT OUR GOING TOO FAR AT PRESENT AS A MARRIAGE IF IT WAS TO TAKE PLACE WOULD BE MORE CONVENIENT AFTER MY RETURN WHEN I SHOULD BE AS I EXPECTED SET UP IN MY BUSINESS
1160-139717-0014 PERHAPS TOO SHE THOUGHT MY EXPECTATIONS NOT SO WELL FOUNDED AS I IMAGINED THEM TO BE MY CHIEF ACQUAINTANCES AT THIS TIME WERE CHARLES OSBORNE JOSEPH WATSON AND JAMES RALPH ALL LOVERS OF READING
1160-139717-0015 CONVEYANCER IN THE TOWN CHARLES BROCKDEN THE OTHER WAS CLERK TO A MERCHANT WATSON WAS A PIOUS SENSIBLE YOUNG MAN OF GREAT INTEGRITY THE OTHERS RATHER MORE LAX IN THEIR PRINCIPLES OF RELIGION
1160-139717-0016 PARTICULARLY RALPH WHO AS WELL AS COLLINS HAD BEEN UNSETTLED BY ME FOR WHICH THEY BOTH MADE ME SUFFER OSBORNE WAS SENSIBLE CANDID FRANK SINCERE AND AFFECTIONATE TO HIS FRIENDS BUT IN LITERARY MATTERS
1160-139717-0017 TOO FOND OF CRITICIZING RALPH WAS INGENIOUS GENTEEL IN HIS MANNERS AND EXTREMELY ELOQUENT I THINK I NEVER KNEW A PRETTIER TALKER BOTH OF THEM WERE GREAT ADMIRERS OF POETRY
1160-139717-0018 ASSUR'D HIM HE HAD NO GENIUS FOR POETRY AND ADVIS'D HIM TO THINK OF NOTHING BEYOND THE BUSINESS HE WAS BRED TO THAT IN THE MERCANTILE WAY THO HE HAD NO STOCK HE MIGHT BY HIS DILIGENCE AND PUNCTUALITY
1160-139717-0019 RECOMMEND HIMSELF TO EMPLOYMENT AS A FACTOR AND IN TIME ACQUIRE WHEREWITH TO TRADE ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT I APPROV'D THE AMUSING ONE'S SELF WITH POETRY NOW AND THEN SO FAR AS TO IMPROVE ONE'S LANGUAGE BUT NO FARTHER
1160-139717-0020 WE EXCLUDED ALL CONSIDERATIONS OF INVENTION BY AGREEING THAT THE TASK SHOULD BE A VERSION OF THE EIGHTEENTH PSALM WHICH DESCRIBES THE DESCENT OF A DEITY WHEN THE TIME OF OUR MEETING DREW NIGH RALPH CALLED ON ME FIRST
1160-139717-0021 AND LET ME KNOW HIS PIECE WAS READY I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN BUSY AND HAVING LITTLE INCLINATION HAD DONE NOTHING HE THEN SHOW'D ME HIS PIECE FOR MY OPINION AND I MUCH APPROV'D IT AS IT APPEAR'D TO ME TO HAVE GREAT MERIT
1160-139717-0022 NOW SAYS HE OSBORNE NEVER WILL ALLOW THE LEAST MERIT IN ANYTHING OF MINE BUT MAKES ONE THOUSAND CRITICISMS OUT OF MERE ENVY HE IS NOT SO JEALOUS OF YOU I WISH THEREFORE YOU WOULD TAKE THIS PIECE AND PRODUCE IT AS YOURS
1160-139717-0023 I WILL PRETEND NOT TO HAVE HAD TIME AND SO PRODUCE NOTHING WE SHALL THEN SEE WHAT HE WILL SAY TO IT IT WAS AGREED AND I IMMEDIATELY TRANSCRIB'D IT
1160-139717-0024 WE MET WATSON'S PERFORMANCE WAS READ THERE WERE SOME BEAUTIES IN IT BUT MANY DEFECTS OSBORNE'S WAS READ IT WAS MUCH BETTER RALPH DID IT JUSTICE REMARKED SOME FAULTS BUT APPLAUDED THE BEAUTIES
1160-139717-0026 BUT NO EXCUSE COULD BE ADMITTED PRODUCE I MUST
1160-139717-0027 AND JOIN'D IN APPLAUDING IT RALPH ONLY MADE SOME CRITICISMS AND PROPOS'D SOME AMENDMENTS BUT I DEFENDED MY TEXT OSBORNE WAS AGAINST RALPH AND TOLD HIM HE WAS NO BETTER A CRITIC THAN POET SO HE DROPT THE ARGUMENT
1160-139717-0028 BUT WHO WOULD HAVE IMAGIN'D SAID HE THAT FRANKLIN HAD BEEN CAPABLE OF SUCH A PERFORMANCE SUCH PAINTING SUCH FORCE SUCH FIRE HE HAS EVEN IMPROV'D THE ORIGINAL
1160-139717-0029 IN HIS COMMON CONVERSATION HE SEEMS TO HAVE NO CHOICE OF WORDS HE HESITATES AND BLUNDERS AND YET GOOD GOD HOW HE WRITES
1160-139717-0030 AND OSBORNE WAS A LITTLE LAUGHED AT THIS TRANSACTION FIXED RALPH IN HIS RESOLUTION OF BECOMING A POET I DID ALL I COULD TO DISSUADE HIM FROM IT BUT HE CONTINUED SCRIBBLING VERSES TILL POPE CURED HIM
1160-139727-0000 QUARRELS WITH THE PROPRIETARY GOVERNORS
1160-139727-0001 MISTER MORRIS ASK'D ME IF I THOUGHT HE MUST EXPECT AS UNCOMFORTABLE AN ADMINISTRATION I SAID NO YOU MAY ON THE CONTRARY HAVE A VERY COMFORTABLE ONE IF YOU WILL ONLY TAKE CARE
1160-139727-0002 I PROMISE YOU I WILL IF POSSIBLE AVOID THEM HE HAD SOME REASON FOR LOVING TO DISPUTE BEING ELOQUENT
1160-139727-0003 AND THEREFORE GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL IN ARGUMENTATIVE CONVERSATION HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO IT FROM A BOY HIS FATHER AS I HAVE HEARD ACCUSTOMING HIS CHILDREN TO DISPUTE WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR HIS DIVERSION
1160-139727-0004 FOR IN THE COURSE OF MY OBSERVATION THESE DISPUTING CONTRADICTING AND CONFUTING PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY UNFORTUNATE IN THEIR AFFAIRS THEY GET VICTORY SOMETIMES BUT THEY NEVER GET GOOD WILL
1160-139727-0005 WHICH WOULD BE OF MORE USE TO THEM WE PARTED HE GOING TO PHILADELPHIA AND I TO BOSTON IN RETURNING I MET AT NEW YORK WITH THE VOTES OF THE ASSEMBLY BY WHICH IT APPEAR'D THAT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS PROMISE TO ME HE AND THE HOUSE WERE ALREADY IN HIGH CONTENTION
1160-139727-0006 AND IT WAS A CONTINUAL BATTLE BETWEEN THEM AS LONG AS HE RETAIN'D THE GOVERNMENT I HAD MY SHARE OF IT FOR AS SOON AS I GOT BACK TO MY SEAT IN THE ASSEMBLY I WAS PUT ON EVERY COMMITTEE FOR ANSWERING HIS SPEECHES AND MESSAGES
1160-139727-0007 THE PROPRIETOR WOULD GIVE YOU A GOOD PRICE THE GOVERNOR SAYS I
1160-139727-0008 THICK UPON HIS OWN FACE SO THAT FINDING HE WAS LIKELY TO BE NEGROFIED HIMSELF HE AS WELL AS MISTER HAMILTON
1160-139727-0009 OUR HEREDITARY GOVERNORS WHO WHEN ANY EXPENSE WAS TO BE INCURRED FOR THE DEFENSE OF THEIR PROVINCE WITH INCREDIBLE MEANNESS INSTRUCTED THEIR DEPUTIES TO PASS NO ACT FOR LEVYING THE NECESSARY TAXES
1160-139727-0010 UNLESS THEIR VAST ESTATES WERE IN THE SAME ACT EXPRESSLY EXCUSED AND THEY HAD EVEN TAKEN BONDS OF THESE DEPUTIES TO OBSERVE SUCH INSTRUCTIONS THE ASSEMBLIES FOR THREE YEARS HELD OUT AGAINST THIS INJUSTICE
1160-139727-0011 THO CONSTRAINED TO BEND AT LAST AT LENGTH CAPTAIN DENNY WHO WAS GOVERNOR MORRIS'S SUCCESSOR
1160-139727-0012 THE GOVERNMENT OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY PROJECTED
1160-139727-0013 AND MISTER POWNALL AFTERWARD GOVERNOR POWNALL TO NEW YORK TO SOLICIT ASSISTANCE AS I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY KNEW ITS TEMPER AND WAS MISTER QUINCY'S COUNTRYMAN HE APPLI'D TO ME FOR MY INFLUENCE AND ASSISTANCE
1160-139727-0014 AND THEREFORE I PROPOS'D THAT THE ORDERS SHOULD BE PAYABLE IN A YEAR AND TO BEAR AN INTEREST OF FIVE PER CENT WITH THESE ORDERS I SUPPOS'D THE PROVISIONS MIGHT EASILY BE PURCHAS'D THE ASSEMBLY WITH VERY LITTLE HESITATION ADOPTED THE PROPOSAL THE ORDERS WERE IMMEDIATELY PRINTED
1160-139727-0015 THE FUND FOR PAYING THEM WAS THE INTEREST OF ALL THE PAPER CURRENCY THEN EXTANT IN THE PROVINCE UPON LOAN TOGETHER WITH THE REVENUE ARISING FROM THE EXCISE WHICH BEING KNOWN TO BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT
1160-139730-0000 BEFORE I PROCEED IN RELATING THE PART I HAD IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS UNDER THIS NEW GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION IT MAY NOT BE AMISS HERE TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF MY PHILOSOPHICAL REPUTATION
1160-139730-0001 IN SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX BEING AT BOSTON I MET THERE WITH A DOCTOR SPENCE WHO WAS LATELY ARRIVED FROM SCOTLAND AND SHOW'D ME SOME ELECTRIC EXPERIMENTS THEY WERE IMPERFECTLY PERFORM'D AS HE WAS NOT VERY EXPERT
1160-139730-0002 A PRESENT OF A GLASS TUBE WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF THE USE OF IT IN MAKING SUCH EXPERIMENTS I EAGERLY SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF REPEATING WHAT I HAD SEEN AT BOSTON
1160-139730-0003 ADDING A NUMBER OF NEW ONES I SAY MUCH PRACTICE FOR MY HOUSE WAS CONTINUALLY FULL FOR SOME TIME WITH PEOPLE WHO CAME TO SEE THESE NEW WONDERS
1160-139730-0004 WAS FOUNDED IN SIXTEEN SIXTY AND HOLDS THE FOREMOST PLACE AMONG ENGLISH SOCIETIES FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE
1160-139730-0005 TO DIVIDE A LITTLE THIS INCUMBRANCE AMONG MY FRIENDS I CAUSED A NUMBER OF SIMILAR TUBES TO BE BLOWN AT OUR GLASS HOUSE WITH WHICH THEY FURNISH'D THEMSELVES SO THAT WE HAD AT LENGTH SEVERAL PERFORMERS
1160-139730-0006 AND ACCOMPANIED WITH SUCH EXPLANATIONS IN SUCH METHOD
1160-139730-0007 SHOULD ASSIST IN COMPREHENDING THE FOLLOWING HE PROCUR'D AN ELEGANT APPARATUS FOR THE PURPOSE IN WHICH ALL THE LITTLE MACHINES THAT I HAD ROUGHLY MADE FOR MYSELF WERE NICELY FORM'D BY INSTRUMENT MAKERS HIS LECTURES
1160-139730-0008 WERE WELL ATTENDED AND GAVE GREAT SATISFACTION AND AFTER SOME TIME HE WENT THRO THE COLONIES EXHIBITING THEM IN EVERY CAPITAL TOWN AND PICK'D UP SOME MONEY
1160-139730-0009 OBLIG'D AS WE WERE TO MISTER COLLINSON FOR HIS PRESENT OF THE TUBE ET CETERA I THOUGHT IT RIGHT HE SHOULD BE INFORM'D OF OUR SUCCESS IN USING IT AND WROTE HIM SEVERAL LETTERS CONTAINING ACCOUNTS OF OUR EXPERIMENTS
1160-139730-0010 WHERE THEY WERE NOT AT FIRST THOUGHT WORTH SO MUCH NOTICE AS TO BE PRINTED IN THEIR TRANSACTIONS ONE PAPER WHICH I WROTE FOR MISTER KINNERSLEY
1160-139730-0011 AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MINE AND ONE OF THE MEMBERS ALSO OF THAT SOCIETY WHO WROTE ME WORD THAT IT HAD BEEN READ BUT WAS LAUGHED AT BY THE CONNOISSEURS THE PAPERS HOWEVER BEING SHOWN TO DOCTOR FOTHERGILL
1160-139730-0012 HE THOUGHT THEM OF TOO MUCH VALUE TO BE STIFLED AND ADVIS'D THE PRINTING OF THEM MISTER COLLINSON THEN GAVE THEM TO CAVE FOR PUBLICATION IN HIS GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE BUT HE CHOSE TO PRINT THEM SEPARATELY IN A PAMPHLET
1160-139730-0013 AND DOCTOR FOTHERGILL WROTE THE PREFACE CAVE IT SEEMS JUDGED RIGHTLY FOR HIS PROFIT FOR BY THE ADDITIONS
1160-139730-0014 BELIEVING IT WAS BETTER TO SPEND WHAT TIME I COULD SPARE FROM PUBLIC BUSINESS IN MAKING NEW EXPERIMENTS THAN IN DISPUTING ABOUT THOSE ALREADY MADE I THEREFORE NEVER ANSWERED
1160-139730-0015 OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES TOOK UP MY CAUSE AND REFUTED HIM
1160-139730-0016 LANGUAGES AND THE DOCTRINE IT CONTAIN'D WAS BY DEGREES UNIVERSALLY ADOPTED BY THE PHILOSOPHERS OF EUROPE IN PREFERENCE TO THAT OF THE ABBE SO THAT HE LIVED TO SEE HIMSELF THE LAST OF HIS SECT
1160-139730-0017 THIS ENGAG'D THE PUBLIC ATTENTION EVERYWHERE
1160-139730-0018 WHO HAD AN APPARATUS FOR EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY
1160-139730-0019 UNDERTOOK TO REPEAT WHAT HE CALLED THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENTS AND AFTER THEY WERE PERFORMED BEFORE THE KING AND COURT ALL THE CURIOUS OF PARIS FLOCKED TO SEE THEM I WILL NOT SWELL THIS NARRATIVE WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THAT CAPITAL EXPERIMENT
1160-139730-0020 AS BOTH ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE HISTORIES OF ELECTRICITY
1165-135216-0000 CHAPTER ONE THE FINDING OF THE COPPER CYLINDER IT OCCURRED AS FAR BACK AS FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY
1165-135216-0001 AND WERE NOW ON THEIR WAY TO THE MEDITERRANEAN THE WIND HAD FAILED A DEEP CALM HAD SUCCEEDED AND EVERYWHERE AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH THE WATER WAS SMOOTH AND GLASSY
1165-135216-0002 THE YACHT ROSE AND FELL AT THE IMPULSE OF THE LONG OCEAN UNDULATIONS AND THE CREAKING OF THE SPARS SOUNDED OUT A LAZY ACCOMPANIMENT TO THE MOTION OF THE VESSEL ALL AROUND WAS A WATERY HORIZON
1165-135216-0003 EXCEPT IN THE ONE PLACE ONLY TOWARD THE SOUTH WHERE FAR IN THE DISTANCE THE PEAK OF TENERIFFE ROSE INTO THE AIR THE PROFOUND CALM THE WARM ATMOSPHERE THE SLOW PITCHING OF THE YACHT
1165-135216-0004 AND THE DULL CREAKING OF THE SPARS ALL COMBINED TO LULL INTO A STATE OF INDOLENT REPOSE THE PEOPLE ON BOARD FORWARD WERE THE CREW SOME ASLEEP OTHERS SMOKING OTHERS PLAYING CARDS
1165-135216-0005 THESE TWO LIKE THE CREW WERE IN A STATE OF DULL AND LANGUID REPOSE SUSPENDED BETWEEN THE TWO MASTS IN AN INDIAN HAMMOCK LAY FEATHERSTONE WITH A CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH AND A NOVEL IN HIS HAND WHICH HE WAS PRETENDING TO READ
1165-135216-0006 THE FOURTH MEMBER OF THE PARTY MELICK WAS SEATED NEAR THE MAINMAST FOLDING SOME PAPERS IN A PECULIAR WAY HIS OCCUPATION AT LENGTH ATTRACTED THE ROVING EYES OF FEATHERSTONE WHO POKED FORTH HIS HEAD FROM HIS HAMMOCK AND SAID IN A SLEEPY VOICE
1165-135216-0007 I SAY MELICK YOU'RE THE MOST ENERGETIC FELLAH I EVER SAW BY JOVE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE ABOARD THAT'S BUSY WHAT ARE YOU DOING PAPER BOATS SAID MELICK IN A BUSINESS LIKE TONE
1165-135216-0008 PAPER BOATS BY JOVE SAID FEATHERSTONE WHAT FOR I'M GOING TO HAVE A REGATTA SAID MELICK ANYTHING TO KILL TIME YOU KNOW BY JOVE EXCLAIMED FEATHERSTONE AGAIN RAISING HIMSELF HIGHER IN HIS HAMMOCK
1165-135216-0009 THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA A WEGATTA BY JOVE GLOWIOUS GLOWIOUS I SAY OXENDEN DID YOU HEAR THAT
1165-135216-0010 OH I MEAN A RACE WITH THESE PAPER BOATS WE CAN BET ON THEM YOU KNOW AT THIS FEATHERSTONE SAT UPRIGHT WITH HIS LEGS DANGLING OUT OF THE HAMMOCK BY JOVE HE EXCLAIMED AGAIN BETTING SO WE CAN
1165-135216-0011 WHO WENT SOLEMNLY ON AS HE SPOKE FOLDING HIS PAPER BOATS THAT'S THE FUN OF IT FOR YOU SEE IF THERE WAS A WIND WE SHOULD BE GOING ON OURSELVES AND THE REGATTA COULDN'T COME OFF BUT AS IT IS THE WATER IS JUST RIGHT YOU PICK OUT YOUR BOAT AND LAY YOUR BET ON HER TO RACE TO SOME GIVEN POINT
1165-135216-0012 A GIVEN POINT BUT HOW CAN WE FIND ANY OH EASILY ENOUGH SOMETHING OR ANYTHING A BUBBLE'LL DO OR WE CAN PITCH OUT A BIT OF WOOD UPON THIS FEATHERSTONE DESCENDED FROM HIS PERCH AND CAME NEAR TO EXAMINE THE PROCEEDINGS
1165-135216-0013 WHILE THE OTHER TWO EAGER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW EXCITEMENT SOON JOINED HIM BY THIS TIME MELICK HAD FINISHED HIS PAPER BOATS THERE WERE FOUR OF THEM AND THEY WERE MADE OF DIFFERENT COLORS NAMELY RED GREEN YELLOW AND WHITE
1165-135216-0014 I'LL PUT THESE IN THE WATER SAID MELICK AND THEN WE CAN LAY OUR BETS ON THEM AS WE CHOOSE BUT FIRST LET US SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT CAN BE TAKEN AS A POINT OF ARRIVAL IF THERE ISN'T ANYTHING I CAN PITCH OUT A BIT OF WOOD IN ANY DIRECTION WHICH MAY SEEM BEST
1165-135216-0015 SAYING THIS HE WENT TO THE SIDE FOLLOWED BY THE OTHERS AND ALL LOOKED OUT CAREFULLY OVER THE WATER THERE'S A BLACK SPECK OUT THERE SAID OXENDEN SO THERE IS SAID FEATHERSTONE THAT'LL DO I WONDER WHAT IT IS
1165-135216-0016 IT'S ONLY A ROUND SPOT LIKE THE FLOAT OF SOME NET OH IT'S A SPAR SAID MELICK IT'S ONE END OF IT THE REST IS UNDER WATER THE SPOT THUS CHOSEN WAS A DARK CIRCULAR OBJECT ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
1165-135216-0017 AND CERTAINLY DID LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE THE EXTREMITY OF SOME SPAR THE REST OF WHICH WAS UNDER WATER WHATEVER IT WAS HOWEVER IT SERVED WELL ENOUGH FOR THEIR PRESENT PURPOSE
1165-135216-0018 MELICK NOW LET HIMSELF DOWN OVER THE SIDE AND PLACED THE PAPER BOATS ON THE WATER AS CAREFULLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER THIS THE FOUR STOOD WATCHING THE LITTLE FLEET IN SILENCE THE WATER WAS PERFECTLY STILL
1165-135216-0019 AND THERE WAS NO PERCEPTIBLE WIND BUT THERE WERE DRAUGHTS OF AIR CAUSED BY THE RISE AND FALL OF THE YACHT AND THESE AFFECTED THE TINY BOATS GRADUALLY THEY DREW APART THE GREEN ONE DRIFTING ASTERN THE YELLOW ONE REMAINING UNDER THE VESSEL
1165-135216-0020 WHILE THE RED AND THE WHITE WERE CARRIED OUT IN THE DIRECTION WHERE THEY WERE EXPECTED TO GO WITH ABOUT A FOOT OF SPACE BETWEEN THEM TWO TO ONE ON THE RED CRIED FEATHERSTONE BETTING ON THE ONE WHICH HAD GAINED THE LEAD DONE SAID MELICK PROMPTLY TAKING HIS OFFER
1165-135216-0021 OXENDEN MADE THE SAME BET WHICH WAS TAKEN BY MELICK AND THE DOCTOR
1165-135216-0022 AS TO THE TIME WHICH WOULD BE OCCUPIED BY THE RACE AND AS TO FIFTY OTHER THINGS WHICH NEED NOT BE MENTIONED ALL TOOK PART IN THIS THE EXCITEMENT ROSE HIGH AND THE BETTING WENT ON MERRILY AT LENGTH IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE WHITE WAS OVERHAULING THE RED
1165-135216-0023 THE EXCITEMENT GREW INTENSE THE BETTING CHANGED ITS FORM BUT WAS STILL KEPT UP UNTIL AT LAST THE TWO PAPER BOATS SEEMED BLENDED TOGETHER IN ONE DIM SPOT WHICH GRADUALLY FADED OUT OF SIGHT IT WAS NOW NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE STATE OF THE RACE
1165-135216-0024 SO FEATHERSTONE ORDERED OUT THE BOAT THE FOUR WERE SOON EMBARKED AND THE MEN ROWED OUT TOWARD THE POINT WHICH HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS THE END OF THE RACE ON COMING NEAR
1165-135216-0025 AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION AROSE ABOUT THIS SOME OF THE BETS WERE OFF BUT OTHERS REMAINED AN OPEN QUESTION AND EACH SIDE INSISTED UPON A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE CASE IN THE MIDST OF THIS FEATHERSTONE'S ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO THE DARK SPOT ALREADY MENTIONED AS THE GOAL OF THE RACE
1165-135216-0026 PULL UP LADS A LITTLE LET'S SEE WHAT IT IS IT DOESN'T LOOK TO ME LIKE A SPAR THE OTHERS ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SOME NEW OBJECT OF INTEREST WERE ATTRACTED BY THESE WORDS AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE THING IN QUESTION THE MEN PULLED THE BOAT DREW NEARER
1165-135216-0027 IT'S NOT A SPAR SAID MELICK WHO WAS AT THE BOW AND AS HE SAID THIS HE REACHED OUT AND GRASPED AT IT HE FAILED TO GET IT AND DID NO MORE THAN TOUCH IT IT MOVED EASILY AND SANK BUT SOON CAME UP AGAIN
1165-135216-0028 A SECOND TIME HE GRASPED AT IT AND WITH BOTH HANDS THIS TIME HE CAUGHT IT AND THEN LIFTED IT OUT OF THE WATER INTO THE BOAT THESE PROCEEDINGS HAD BEEN WATCHED WITH THE DEEPEST INTEREST AND NOW AS THIS CURIOUS FLOATING THING MADE ITS APPEARANCE AMONG THEM
1165-135216-0029 THEY ALL CROWDED AROUND IT IN EAGER EXCITEMENT IT LOOKS LIKE A CAN OF PRESERVED MEAT SAID THE DOCTOR IT CERTAINLY IS A CAN SAID MELICK FOR IT'S MADE OF METAL BUT AS TO PRESERVED MEAT I HAVE MY DOUBTS
1165-135216-0030 THE NATURE OF THE METAL WAS NOT EASILY PERCEPTIBLE FOR IT WAS COATED WITH SLIME AND COVERED OVER ABOUT HALF ITS SURFACE WITH BARNACLES AND SEA WEED
1165-135216-0031 IT'S SOME KIND OF PRESERVED MEAT SAID THE DOCTOR PERHAPS SOMETHING GOOD GAME I DARE SAY YES YORKSHIRE GAME PIE THEY POT ALL SORTS OF THINGS NOW
1165-135216-0032 IF IT'S GAME SAID OXENDEN IT'LL BE RATHER HIGH BY THIS TIME MAN ALIVE LOOK AT THOSE WEEDS AND SHELLS IT MUST HAVE BEEN FLOATING FOR AGES IT'S MY BELIEF SAID FEATHERSTONE THAT IT'S PART OF THE PROVISIONS LAID IN BY NOAH FOR HIS LONG VOYAGE IN THE ARK
1165-135216-0033 BUT WHATEVER IT IS IT ISN'T LIQUOR IT'S ODD TOO THE THING IS OF FOREIGN MAKE EVIDENTLY I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE IT MAY BE CHINESE BY JOVE CRIED FEATHERSTONE THIS IS GETTING EXCITING LET'S GO BACK TO THE YACHT AND OPEN IT THE MEN ROWED BACK TO THE YACHT
1165-135216-0034 IT'S MEAT OF SOME SORT CONTINUED THE DOCTOR I'M CERTAIN OF THAT IT HAS COME IN GOOD TIME WE CAN HAVE IT FOR DINNER YOU MAY HAVE MY SHARE THEN SAID OXENDEN I HEREBY GIVE AND BEQUEATH TO YOU ALL MY RIGHT TITLE AND INTEREST IN AND TO
1165-135216-0035 ANYTHING IN THE SHAPE OF MEAT THAT MAY BE INSIDE MEAT CANS SAID MELICK ARE NEVER SO LARGE AS THAT OH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SAID THE DOCTOR THEY MAKE UP PRETTY LARGE PACKAGES OF PEMMICAN FOR THE ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS
1165-135216-0036 COPPER EXCLAIMED OXENDEN IS IT COPPER LOOK FOR YOURSELVES SAID MELICK QUIETLY THEY ALL LOOKED AND COULD SEE WHERE THE KNIFE HAD CUT INTO THE VESSEL THAT IT WAS AS HE SAID IT WAS COPPER
1165-135216-0037 IT'S FOREIGN WORK SAID MELICK IN ENGLAND WE MAKE TIN CANS FOR EVERYTHING
1165-135216-0038 IN THAT CASE SAID OXENDEN IT MAY CONTAIN THE MANGLED REMAINS OF ONE OF THE WIVES OF SOME MOORISH PASHA BY THIS TIME THEY HAD REACHED THE YACHT AND HURRIED ABOARD ALL WERE EAGER TO SATISFY THEIR CURIOSITY
1165-135216-0039 THEN FEATHERSTONE PRODUCED A KNIFE WHICH WAS USED TO OPEN SARDINE BOXES BUT AFTER A FAITHFUL TRIAL THIS PROVED USELESS AT LENGTH MELICK WHO HAD GONE OFF IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING MORE EFFECTIVE MADE HIS APPEARANCE ARMED WITH AN AXE
1165-135216-0040 WITH THIS HE ATTACKED THE COPPER CYLINDER AND BY MEANS OF A FEW DEXTEROUS BLOWS SUCCEEDED IN CUTTING IT OPEN THEN HE LOOKED IN
1165-135216-0041 SOMETHING SAID MELICK BUT I CAN'T QUITE MAKE IT OUT IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT OUT THEN SHAKE IT OUT SAID OXENDEN UPON THIS MELICK TOOK THE CYLINDER TURNED IT UPSIDE DOWN SHOOK IT SMARTLY AND THEN LIFTED IT AND POUNDED IT AGAINST THE DECK
1165-135216-0042 THIS SERVED TO LOOSEN THE CONTENTS WHICH SEEMED TIGHTLY PACKED BUT CAME GRADUALLY DOWN UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY COULD BE SEEN AND DRAWN FORTH MELICK DREW THEM FORTH AND THE CONTENTS OF THE MYSTERIOUS COPPER CYLINDER RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO TWO PACKAGES
1165-135216-0043 THE SIGHT OF THESE PACKAGES ONLY SERVED TO INTENSIFY THEIR CURIOSITY IF IT HAD BEEN SOME SPECIES OF FOOD IT WOULD AT ONCE HAVE REVEALED ITSELF BUT THESE PACKAGES SUGGESTED SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT WHAT COULD THEY BE
1165-135216-0044 OR STRANGE COIN FROM FAR CATHAY ONE OF THE PACKAGES WAS VERY MUCH LARGER THAN THE OTHER IT WAS ENCLOSED IN WRAPPERS MADE OF SOME COARSE KIND OF FELT BOUND TIGHT WITH STRONG CORDS
1165-135216-0045 THE OTHER WAS MUCH SMALLER AND WAS FOLDED IN THE SAME MATERIAL WITHOUT BEING BOUND THIS MELICK SEIZED AND BEGAN TO OPEN WAIT A MINUTE SAID FEATHERSTONE LET'S MAKE A BET ON IT FIVE GUINEAS THAT IT'S SOME SORT OF JEWELS DONE SAID OXENDEN
1165-135216-0046 MELICK OPENED THE PACKAGE AND IT WAS SEEN THAT FEATHERSTONE HAD LOST THERE WERE NO JEWELS BUT ONE OR TWO SHEETS OF SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE PAPER IT WAS NOT PAPER HOWEVER BUT SOME VEGETABLE PRODUCT WHICH WAS USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE
1165-135216-0047 THE SURFACE WAS SMOOTH BUT THE COLOR WAS DINGY AND THE LINES OF THE VEGETABLE FIBRES WERE PLAINLY DISCERNIBLE THESE SHEETS WERE COVERED WITH WRITING HALLOA CRIED MELICK WHY THIS IS ENGLISH
1165-135216-0048 AT THIS THE OTHERS CROWDED AROUND TO LOOK ON AND FEATHERSTONE IN HIS EXCITEMENT FORGOT THAT HE HAD LOST HIS BET THERE WERE THREE SHEETS ALL COVERED WITH WRITING ONE IN ENGLISH ANOTHER IN FRENCH AND A THIRD IN GERMAN
1165-135216-0050 I HAVE WRITTEN THIS AND COMMITTED IT TO THE SEA IN THE HOPE THAT THE OCEAN CURRENTS MAY BEAR IT WITHIN THE REACH OF CIVILIZED MAN OH UNKNOWN FRIEND WHOEVER YOU ARE I ENTREAT YOU TO LET THIS MESSAGE BE MADE KNOWN IN SOME WAY TO MY FATHER HENRY MORE
1165-135216-0051 KESWICK CUMBERLAND ENGLAND SO THAT HE MAY LEARN THE FATE OF HIS SON
1165-135216-0052 WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE FORWARDED TO HIM DO THIS FOR THE SAKE OF THAT MERCY WHICH YOU MAY ONE DAY WISH TO HAVE SHOWN TO YOURSELF ADAM MORE BY JOVE CRIED FEATHERSTONE AS HE READ THE ABOVE THIS IS REALLY GETTING TO BE SOMETHING TREMENDOUS
1165-135216-0053 THIS OTHER PACKAGE MUST BE THE MANUSCRIPT SAID OXENDEN AND IT'LL TELL ALL ABOUT IT SUCH A MANUSCRIPT'LL BE BETTER THAN MEAT SAID THE DOCTOR SENTENTIOUSLY MELICK SAID NOTHING BUT OPENING HIS KNIFE HE CUT THE CORDS AND UNFOLDED THE WRAPPER
1165-135216-0054 HE SAW A GREAT COLLECTION OF LEAVES JUST LIKE THOSE OF THE LETTER OF SOME VEGETABLE SUBSTANCE SMOOTH AS PAPER AND COVERED WITH WRITING IT LOOKS LIKE EGYPTIAN PAPYRUS SAID THE DOCTOR THAT WAS THE COMMON PAPER OF ANTIQUITY
1165-135216-0055 NEVER MIND THE EGYPTIAN PAPYRUS SAID FEATHERSTONE IN FEVERISH CURIOSITY LET'S HAVE THE CONTENTS OF THE MANUSCRIPT YOU MELICK READ YOU'RE THE MOST ENERGETIC OF THE LOT AND WHEN YOU'RE TIRED THE REST OF US WILL TAKE TURNS READ
1165-135216-0056 WHY IT'LL TAKE A MONTH TO READ ALL THIS SAID MELICK ALL THE BETTER SAID FEATHERSTONE THIS CALM WILL PROBABLY LAST A MONTH AND WE SHALL HAVE NOTHING TO INTEREST US
1165-135220-0000 CHAPTER FIVE THE TORRENT SWEEPING UNDER THE MOUNTAINS THE BOAT DRIFTED ON THE LIGHT GIVEN BY THE AURORA AND THE LOW MOON SEEMED TO GROW FAINTER
1165-135220-0001 AND AS I LOOKED BEHIND I SAW THAT THE DISTANT GLOW FROM THE VOLCANIC FIRES HAD BECOME MORE BRILLIANT IN THE INCREASING DARKNESS THE SIDES OF THE CHANNEL GREW STEEPER UNTIL AT LAST THEY BECAME ROCKY PRECIPICES RISING TO AN UNKNOWN HEIGHT
1165-135220-0002 BUT WITH THIS LESSENING WIDTH THE WATERS SEEMED TO RUSH FAR MORE SWIFTLY HERE I DRIFTED HELPLESSLY AND SAW THE GLOOMY ROCKY CLIFFS SWEEP PAST ME AS I WAS HURLED ONWARD ON THE BREAST OF THE TREMENDOUS FLOOD I WAS IN DESPAIR
1165-135220-0003 THE FATE OF AGNEW HAD PREPARED ME FOR MY OWN AND I WAS ONLY THANKFUL THAT MY FATE SINCE IT WAS INEVITABLE WOULD BE LESS APPALLING DEATH SEEMED CERTAIN AND MY CHIEF THOUGHT NOW WAS AS TO THE MOMENT WHEN IT WOULD COME I WAS PREPARED
1165-135220-0004 FAR BETTER WAS A DEATH HERE AMID THE ROAR OF WATERS THAN AT THE HANDS OF THOSE ABHORRENT BEINGS BY WHOSE TREACHERY MY FRIEND HAD FALLEN AS I WENT ON THE PRECIPICES ROSE HIGHER AND SEEMED TO OVERHANG THE CHANNEL GREW NARROWER
1165-135220-0005 THE LIGHT GREW FAINTER UNTIL AT LAST ALL AROUND ME GREW DARK I WAS FLOATING AT THE BOTTOM OF A VAST CHASM WHERE THE SIDES SEEMED TO RISE PRECIPITOUSLY FOR THOUSANDS OF FEET WHERE NEITHER WATERY FLOOD NOR ROCKY WALL WAS VISIBLE
1165-135220-0006 AND WHERE FAR ABOVE I COULD SEE THE LINE OF SKY BETWEEN THE SUMMITS OF THE CLIFFS AND WATCH THE GLOWING STARS AND AS I WATCHED THEM THERE CAME TO ME THE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS MY LAST SIGHT ON EARTH
1165-135220-0007 AND I COULD ONLY HOPE THAT THE LIFE WHICH WAS SO SWIFTLY APPROACHING ITS END MIGHT LIVE AGAIN SOMEWHERE AMONG THOSE GLITTERING ORBS SO I THOUGHT AND WITH THESE THOUGHTS I DRIFTED ON I CANNOT TELL HOW LONG
1165-135220-0008 UNTIL AT LENGTH THERE APPEARED A VAST BLACK MASS WHERE THE OPEN SKY ABOVE ME TERMINATED
1165-135220-0009 THIS THEN I THOUGHT IS THE END HERE AMID THIS DARKNESS I MUST MAKE THE AWFUL PLUNGE AND FIND MY DEATH I FELL UPON MY KNEES IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT AND PRAYED AS I KNELT THERE THE BOAT DREW NEARER THE BLACK MASS GREW BLACKER
1165-135220-0010 THE CURRENT SWEPT ME ON THERE WERE NO BREAKERS THERE WAS NO PHOSPHORESCENT SPARKLE OF SEETHING WATERS AND NO WHITENESS OF FOAM I THOUGHT THAT I WAS ON THE BRINK OF SOME TREMENDOUS CATARACT A THOUSAND TIMES DEEPER THAN NIAGARA
1165-135220-0011 SOME FALL WHERE THE WATERS PLUNGED INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH AND WHERE GATHERING FOR THE TERRIFIC DESCENT ALL OTHER MOVEMENTS ALL DASHINGS AND WRITHINGS AND TWISTINGS WERE OBLITERATED AND LOST IN THE ONE OVERWHELMING ONWARD RUSH
1165-135220-0012 SUDDENLY ALL GREW DARK DARK BEYOND ALL EXPRESSION THE SKY ABOVE WAS IN A MOMENT SNATCHED FROM VIEW I HAD BEEN FLUNG INTO SOME TREMENDOUS CAVERN AND THERE ON MY KNEES WITH TERROR IN MY HEART I WAITED FOR DEATH
1165-135220-0013 THE MOMENTS PASSED AND DEATH DELAYED TO COME
1165-135220-0014 AND THOUGH I REMAINED ON MY KNEES AND WAITED LONG STILL THE END CAME NOT THE WATERS SEEMED STILL THE BOAT MOTIONLESS IT WAS BORNE UPON THE SURFACE OF A VAST STREAM AS SMOOTH AS GLASS BUT WHO COULD TELL HOW DEEP THAT STREAM WAS OR HOW WIDE
1165-135220-0015 AT LENGTH I ROSE FROM MY KNEES AND SANK DOWN UPON THE SEAT OF THE BOAT AND TRIED TO PEER THROUGH THE GLOOM IN VAIN
1165-135220-0016 I LISTENED BUT HEARD NOTHING SAVE A DEEP DULL DRONING SOUND WHICH SEEMED TO FILL ALL THE AIR AND MAKE IT ALL TREMULOUS WITH ITS VIBRATIONS I TRIED TO COLLECT MY THOUGHTS
1165-135220-0017 AND WHICH I HAD MENTIONED TO AGNEW THIS WAS THE NOTION THAT AT EACH POLE THERE IS A VAST OPENING
1165-135220-0018 FOR IN THAT DARKNESS THERE WERE NO VISIBLE OBJECTS BY WHICH I COULD FIND OUT THE RATE OF MY PROGRESS AND AS THOSE WHO GO UP IN BALLOONS ARE UTTERLY INSENSIBLE OF MOTION
1165-135220-0019 AT LENGTH THERE CAME INTO VIEW SOMETHING WHICH ARRESTED MY ATTENTION AND ENGROSSED ALL MY THOUGHTS IT WAS FAINT GLOW THAT AT FIRST CAUGHT MY GAZE AND ON TURNING TO SEE IT BETTER I SAW A ROUND RED SPOT GLOWING LIKE FIRE
1165-135220-0020 I HAD NOT SEEN THIS BEFORE IT LOOKED LIKE THE MOON WHEN IT RISES FROM BEHIND CLOUDS AND GLOWS RED AND LURID FROM THE HORIZON AND SO THIS GLOWED BUT NOT WITH THE STEADY LIGHT OF THE MOON
1165-135220-0021 FOR THE LIGHT WAS FITFUL AND SOMETIMES FLASHED INTO A BALEFUL BRIGHTNESS WHICH SOON SUBSIDED INTO A DIMMER LUSTRE NEW ALARM AROSE WITHIN ME FOR THIS NEW SIGHT SUGGESTED SOMETHING MORE TERRIBLE THAN ANYTHING THAT I HAD THUS FAR THOUGHT OF
1165-135220-0022 THIS THEN I THOUGHT WAS TO BE THE END OF MY VOYAGE THIS WAS MY GOAL A PIT OF FIRE INTO WHICH I SHOULD BE HURLED WOULD IT BE WELL I THOUGHT TO WAIT FOR SUCH A FATE AND EXPERIENCE SUCH A DEATH AGONY
1165-135220-0023 WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER FOR ME TO TAKE MY OWN LIFE BEFORE I SHOULD KNOW THE WORST I TOOK MY PISTOL AND LOADED IT SO AS TO BE PREPARED BUT HESITATED TO USE IT UNTIL MY FATE SHOULD BE MORE APPARENT SO I SAT HOLDING MY PISTOL
1165-135220-0024 PREPARED TO USE IT WATCHING THE LIGHT AND AWAITING THE TIME WHEN THE GLOWING FIRES SHOULD MAKE ALL FURTHER HOPE IMPOSSIBLE
1165-135220-0025 ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED TO GROW FAINTER THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CHANGE INSTEAD OF SHINING BEFORE ME IT APPEARED MORE ON MY LEFT
1165-135220-0026 ALL THE TIME IT CONTINUED TO GROW FAINTER AND IT SEEMED CERTAIN THAT I WAS MOVING AWAY FROM IT RATHER THAN TOWARD IT IN THE MIDST OF THIS THERE OCCURRED A NEW THOUGHT WHICH SEEMED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS LIGHT
1165-135220-0027 AND FOLLOWED ME STILL WITH THEIR GLARE I HAD BEEN CARRIED INTO THIS DARKNESS THROUGH SOME VAST OPENING WHICH NOW LAY BEHIND ME DISCLOSING THE RED VOLCANO GLOW AND THIS IT WAS THAT CAUSED THAT ROUNDNESS AND RESEMBLANCE TO THE MOON
1165-135220-0028 I SAW THAT I WAS STILL MOVING ON AWAY FROM THAT LIGHT AS BEFORE AND THAT ITS CHANGING POSITION WAS DUE TO THE TURNING OF THE BOAT AS THE WATER DRIFTED IT ALONG NOW STERN FOREMOST NOW SIDEWISE AND AGAIN BOW FOREMOST
1165-135220-0029 FROM THIS IT SEEMED PLAINLY EVIDENT THAT THE WATERS HAD BORNE ME INTO SOME VAST CAVERN OF UNKNOWN EXTENT WHICH WENT UNDER THE MOUNTAINS A SUBTERRANEAN CHANNEL WHOSE ISSUE I COULD NOT CONJECTURE
1165-135220-0030 PERHAPS IN SOME OTHER OCEAN SOME LAND OF ICE AND FROST AND ETERNAL NIGHT BUT THE OLD THEORY OF THE FLOW OF WATER THROUGH THE EARTH HAD TAKEN HOLD OF ME AND COULD NOT BE SHAKEN OFF I KNEW SOME SCIENTIFIC MEN
1165-135220-0031 HELD THE OPINION THAT THE EARTH'S INTERIOR IS A MASS OF MOLTEN ROCK AND PENT UP FIRE AND THAT THE EARTH ITSELF HAD ONCE BEEN A BURNING ORB WHICH HAD COOLED DOWN AT THE SURFACE YET AFTER ALL THIS WAS ONLY A THEORY AND THERE WERE OTHER THEORIES WHICH WERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT
1165-135220-0032 AS A BOY I HAD READ WILD WORKS OF FICTION ABOUT LANDS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH WITH A SUN AT THE CENTRE WHICH GAVE THEM THE LIGHT OF A PERPETUAL DAY THESE I KNEW WERE ONLY THE CREATIONS OF FICTION
1165-135220-0033 IN THAT CASE THERE MIGHT BE NO SUDDEN PLUNGE AFTER ALL THE STREAM MIGHT RUN ON FOR MANY THOUSAND MILES THROUGH THIS TERRIFIC CAVERN GLOOM IN ACCORDANCE WITH NATURAL LAWS AND I MIGHT THUS LIVE AND DRIFT ON IN THIS DARKNESS UNTIL I SHOULD DIE A LINGERING DEATH OF HORROR AND DESPAIR
1165-135220-0034 THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE WAY OF FORMING ANY ESTIMATE AS TO SPEED ALL WAS DARK AND EVEN THE GLOW BEHIND WAS FADING AWAY NOR COULD I MAKE ANY CONJECTURE WHATEVER AS TO THE SIZE OF THE CHANNEL AT THE OPENING IT HAD BEEN CONTRACTED AND NARROW
1165-135220-0035 BUT HERE IT MIGHT HAVE EXPANDED ITSELF TO MILES AND ITS VAULTED TOP MIGHT REACH ALMOST TO THE SUMMIT OF THE LOFTY MOUNTAINS WHILE SIGHT THUS FAILED ME SOUND WAS EQUALLY UNAVAILING FOR IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME A SUSTAINED AND UNINTERMITTENT ROAR
1165-135220-0036 A LOW DRONING SOUND DEEP AND TERRIBLE WITH NO VARIATIONS OF DASHING BREAKERS OR RUSHING RAPIDS OR FALLING CATARACTS VAGUE THOUGHTS OF FINAL ESCAPE CAME AND WENT BUT IN SUCH A SITUATION HOPE COULD NOT BE SUSTAINED
1165-135220-0037 THE THICK DARKNESS OPPRESSED THE SOUL AND AT LENGTH EVEN THE GLOW OF THE DISTANT VOLCANOES WHICH HAD BEEN GRADUALLY DIMINISHING GREW DIMMER AND FAINTER AND FINALLY FADED OUT ALTOGETHER THAT SEEMED TO ME TO BE MY LAST SIGHT OF EARTHLY THINGS
1165-135220-0038 THE DARKNESS GREW SO INTOLERABLE THAT I LONGED FOR SOMETHING TO DISPEL IT IF ONLY FOR A MOMENT I STRUCK A MATCH THE AIR WAS STILL AND THE FLAME FLASHED OUT LIGHTING UP THE BOAT AND SHOWING THE BLACK WATER AROUND ME THIS MADE ME EAGER TO SEE MORE
1165-135220-0039 I LOADED BOTH BARRELS OF THE RIFLE KEEPING MY PISTOL FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE AND THEN FIRED ONE OF THEM THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS REPORT THAT RANG IN MY EARS LIKE A HUNDRED THUNDER VOLLEYS AND ROLLED AND REVERBERATED FAR ALONG AND DIED AWAY IN ENDLESS ECHOES
1165-135220-0040 LIKE THE SUDDEN LIGHTNING IT REVEALED ALL AROUND I SAW A WIDE EXPANSE OF WATER BLACK AS INK A STYGIAN POOL BUT NO ROCKS WERE VISIBLE AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN CARRIED INTO A SUBTERRANEAN SEA
1165-135220-0041 I LOADED THE EMPTY BARREL AND WAITED THE FLASH OF LIGHT HAD REVEALED NOTHING YET IT HAD DISTRACTED MY THOUGHTS AND THE WORK OF RELOADING WAS AN ADDITIONAL DISTRACTION ANYTHING WAS BETTER THAN INACTION
1165-135220-0042 I DID NOT WISH TO WASTE MY AMMUNITION YET I THOUGHT THAT AN OCCASIONAL SHOT MIGHT SERVE SOME GOOD PURPOSE IF IT WAS ONLY TO AFFORD ME SOME RELIEF FROM DESPAIR AND NOW AS I SAT WITH THE RIFLE IN MY HANDS I WAS AWARE OF A SOUND
1165-135220-0043 NEW EXCITING DIFFERENT ALTOGETHER FROM THE MURMUR OF INNUMERABLE WATERS THAT FILLED MY EARS
1165-135220-0044 IT WAS A SOUND THAT SPOKE OF LIFE I HEARD QUICK HEAVY PANTINGS AS OF SOME GREAT LIVING THING AND WITH THIS THERE CAME THE NOISE OF REGULAR MOVEMENTS IN THE WATER AND THE FOAMING AND GURGLING OF WAVES
1165-135220-0045 IT WAS AS THOUGH SOME LIVING BREATHING CREATURE WERE HERE NOT FAR AWAY MOVING THROUGH THESE MIDNIGHT WATERS AND WITH THIS DISCOVERY THERE CAME A NEW FEAR THE FEAR OF PURSUIT
1165-135220-0046 THIS NEW FEAR AROUSED ME TO ACTION IT WAS A DANGER QUITE UNLIKE ANY OTHER WHICH I HAD EVER KNOWN YET THE FEAR WHICH IT INSPIRED WAS A FEELING THAT ROUSED ME TO ACTION AND PROMPTED ME EVEN THOUGH THE COMING DANGER MIGHT BE AS SURE AS DEATH
1165-135220-0047 TO RISE AGAINST IT AND RESIST TO THE LAST SO I STOOD UP WITH MY RIFLE AND LISTENED WITH ALL MY SOUL IN MY SENSE OF HEARING THE SOUNDS AROSE MORE PLAINLY THEY HAD COME NEARER THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT
1165-135220-0048 I RAISED MY RIFLE AND TOOK AIM THEN IN QUICK SUCCESSION TWO REPORTS THUNDERED OUT WITH TREMENDOUS UPROAR AND INTERMINABLE ECHOES BUT THE LONG REVERBERATIONS WERE UNHEEDED IN THE BLAZE OF SUDDEN LIGHT AND THE VISION THAT WAS REVEALED
1165-135220-0049 FOR THERE FULL BEFORE ME I SAW THOUGH BUT FOR AN INSTANT A TREMENDOUS SIGHT IT WAS A VAST MONSTER MOVING IN THE WATERS AGAINST THE STREAM AND TOWARD THE BOAT ITS HEAD WAS RAISED HIGH ITS EYES WERE INFLAMED WITH A BALEFUL LIGHT
1165-135220-0050 ITS JAWS OPENED WIDE BRISTLED WITH SHARP TEETH AND IT HAD A LONG NECK JOINED TO A BODY OF ENORMOUS BULK WITH A TAIL THAT LASHED ALL THE WATER INTO FOAM IT WAS BUT FOR AN INSTANT THAT I SAW IT
1165-135220-0051 FULL OF TERROR AND EXCITEMENT I LOADED MY RIFLE AGAIN AND WAITED LISTENING FOR A RENEWAL OF THE NOISE I FELT SURE THAT THE MONSTER BALKED OF HIS PREY WOULD RETURN WITH REDOUBLED FURY AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO RENEW THE CONFLICT
1165-135220-0052 I FELT THAT THE DANGERS OF THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE AND OF THE RUSHING WATERS HAD PASSED AWAY AND THAT A NEW PERIL HAD ARISEN FROM THE ASSAULT OF THIS MONSTER OF THE DEEP NOR WAS IT THIS ONE ALONE THAT WAS TO BE DREADED WHERE ONE WAS OTHERS WERE SURE TO BE
1165-135220-0053 AND THESE WOULD PROBABLY INCREASE IN NUMBER AS I ADVANCED FARTHER INTO THIS REALM OF DARKNESS AND YET IN SPITE OF THESE GRISLY THOUGHTS I FELT LESS OF HORROR THAN BEFORE FOR THE FEAR WHICH I HAD WAS NOW ASSOCIATED WITH ACTION
1165-135220-0054 AND AS I STOOD WAITING FOR THE ONSET AND LISTENING FOR THE APPROACH OF THE ENEMY THE EXCITEMENT THAT ENSUED WAS A POSITIVE RELIEF FROM THE DULL DESPAIR INTO WHICH I HAD SUNK BUT A MOMENT BEFORE YET THOUGH I WAITED FOR A NEW ATTACK I WAITED IN VAIN
1165-135220-0055 THE MONSTER DID NOT COME BACK EITHER THE FLASH AND THE NOISE HAD TERRIFIED HIM OR THE BULLETS HAD HIT HIM OR ELSE IN HIS VASTNESS HE HAD BEEN INDIFFERENT TO SO FEEBLE A CREATURE AS MYSELF
1165-135220-0056 BUT WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE HE DID NOT EMERGE AGAIN OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND SILENCE INTO WHICH HE HAD SUNK FOR A LONG TIME I STOOD WAITING THEN I SAT DOWN STILL WATCHFUL STILL LISTENING BUT WITHOUT ANY RESULT
1165-135220-0057 UNTIL AT LENGTH I BEGAN TO THINK THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF ANY NEW ATTACK INDEED IT SEEMED NOW AS THOUGH THERE HAD BEEN NO ATTACK AT ALL BUT THAT THE MONSTER HAD BEEN SWIMMING AT RANDOM WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT OF ME
1165-135220-0058 IN WHICH CASE MY RIFLE FLASHES HAD TERRIFIED HIM MORE THAN HIS FEARFUL FORM HAD TERRIFIED ME ON THE WHOLE THIS INCIDENT HAD GREATLY BENEFITED ME IT HAD ROUSED ME FROM MY DESPAIR
1165-135220-0059 I GREW RECKLESS AND FELT A DISPOSITION TO ACQUIESCE IN WHATEVER FATE MIGHT HAVE IN STORE FOR ME
1349-135891-0000 STORY OF THE THREE CALENDERS SONS OF SULTANS AND OF THE FIVE LADIES OF BAGDAD
1349-135891-0001 IN THE REIGN OF CALIPH HAROON AL RUSHEED THERE WAS AT BAGDAD A PORTER WHO NOTWITHSTANDING HIS MEAN AND LABORIOUS BUSINESS WAS A FELLOW OF WIT AND GOOD HUMOUR
1349-135891-0002 ONE MORNING AS HE WAS AT THE PLACE WHERE HE USUALLY PLYED WITH A GREAT BASKET WAITING FOR EMPLOYMENT A HANDSOME YOUNG LADY COVERED WITH A GREAT MUSLIN VEIL ACCOSTED HIM AND SAID WITH A PLEASANT AIR HARK YOU PORTER TAKE YOUR BASKET AND FOLLOW ME
1349-135891-0003 THE PORTER CHARMED WITH THESE WORDS PRONOUNCED IN SO AGREEABLE A MANNER TOOK HIS BASKET IMMEDIATELY SET IT ON HIS HEAD AND FOLLOWED THE LADY EXCLAIMING O HAPPY DAY O DAY OF GOOD LUCK IN A SHORT TIME THE LADY STOPPED BEFORE A GATE THAT WAS SHUT AND KNOCKED
1349-135891-0004 A CHRISTIAN WITH A VENERABLE LONG WHITE BEARD OPENED IT AND SHE PUT MONEY INTO HIS HAND WITHOUT SPEAKING BUT THE CHRISTIAN WHO KNEW WHAT SHE WANTED WENT IN AND IN A LITTLE TIME BROUGHT A LARGE JUG OF EXCELLENT WINE
1349-135891-0005 TAKE THIS JUG SAID THE LADY TO THE PORTER AND PUT IT IN YOUR BASKET THIS BEING DONE SHE COMMANDED HIM TO FOLLOW HER AND AS SHE PROCEEDED THE PORTER CONTINUED HIS EXCLAMATION O HAPPY DAY THIS IS A DAY OF AGREEABLE SURPRISE AND JOY
1349-135891-0006 THE LADY STOPPED AT A FRUIT SHOP WHERE SHE BOUGHT SEVERAL SORTS OF APPLES APRICOTS PEACHES QUINCES LEMONS CITRONS ORANGES
1349-135891-0007 SHE BID THE PORTER PUT ALL INTO HIS BASKET AND FOLLOW HER AS SHE WENT BY A BUTCHER'S STALL SHE MADE HIM WEIGH HER TWENTY FIVE POUNDS OF HIS BEST MEAT WHICH SHE ORDERED THE PORTER TO PUT ALSO INTO HIS BASKET AT ANOTHER SHOP
1349-135891-0008 SHE TOOK CAPERS TARRAGON CUCUMBERS SASSAFRAS AND OTHER HERBS PRESERVED IN VINEGAR AT ANOTHER SHE BOUGHT PISTACHIOS WALNUTS FILBERTS ALMONDS KERNELS OF PINE APPLES AND SUCH OTHER FRUITS AND AT ANOTHER ALL SORTS OF CONFECTIONERY
1349-135891-0009 WHEN THE PORTER HAD PUT ALL THESE THINGS INTO HIS BASKET AND PERCEIVED THAT IT GREW FULL MY GOOD LADY SAID HE YOU OUGHT TO HAVE GIVEN ME NOTICE THAT YOU HAD SO MUCH PROVISION TO CARRY AND THEN I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT A HORSE OR RATHER A CAMEL FOR THE PURPOSE
1349-135891-0010 FOR IF YOU BUY EVER SO LITTLE MORE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO BEAR IT THE LADY LAUGHED AT THE FELLOW'S PLEASANT HUMOUR AND ORDERED HIM STILL TO FOLLOW HER
1349-135891-0011 SHE THEN WENT TO A DRUGGIST WHERE SHE FURNISHED HERSELF WITH ALL MANNER OF SWEET SCENTED WATERS CLOVES MUSK PEPPER GINGER AND A GREAT PIECE OF AMBERGRIS AND SEVERAL OTHER INDIAN SPICES THIS QUITE FILLED THE PORTER'S BASKET AND SHE ORDERED HIM TO FOLLOW HER
1349-135891-0012 THEY WALKED TILL THEY CAME TO A MAGNIFICENT HOUSE WHOSE FRONT WAS ADORNED WITH FINE COLUMNS AND HAD A GATE OF IVORY THERE THEY STOPPED AND THE LADY KNOCKED SOFTLY WHILE THE YOUNG LADY AND THE PORTER WAITED FOR THE OPENING OF THE GATE THE PORTER
1349-135891-0013 MADE A THOUSAND REFLECTIONS HE WONDERED THAT SUCH A FINE LADY SHOULD COME ABROAD TO BUY PROVISIONS HE CONCLUDED SHE COULD NOT BE A SLAVE HER AIR WAS TOO NOBLE AND THEREFORE HE THOUGHT SHE MUST NEEDS BE A WOMAN OF QUALITY
1349-135891-0014 JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO ASK HER SOME QUESTIONS UPON THIS HEAD ANOTHER LADY CAME TO OPEN THE GATE AND APPEARED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL THAT HE WAS PERFECTLY SURPRISED OR RATHER SO MUCH STRUCK WITH HER CHARMS
1349-135891-0015 THAT HE HAD NEARLY SUFFERED HIS BASKET TO FALL FOR HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BEAUTY THAT EQUALLED HER THE LADY WHO BROUGHT THE PORTER WITH HER PERCEIVING HIS DISORDER AND KNOWING THE CAUSE WAS GREATLY DIVERTED AND TOOK SO MUCH PLEASURE IN WATCHING HIS LOOKS
1349-135891-0016 THAT SHE FORGOT THE GATE WAS OPENED PRAY SISTER SAID THE BEAUTIFUL PORTRESS COME IN WHAT DO YOU STAY FOR
1349-135891-0017 THAT HE IS SCARCELY ABLE TO STAND
1349-135891-0018 ENCOMPASSED WITH AN OPEN GALLERY WHICH HAD A COMMUNICATION WITH SEVERAL APARTMENTS OF EXTRAORDINARY MAGNIFICENCE
1349-135891-0019 AT THE FARTHER END OF THE COURT THERE WAS A PLATFORM RICHLY FURNISHED WITH A THRONE OF AMBER IN THE MIDDLE SUPPORTED BY FOUR COLUMNS OF EBONY ENRICHED WITH DIAMONDS AND PEARLS OF AN EXTRAORDINARY SIZE AND COVERED WITH RED SATIN EMBROIDERED WITH INDIAN GOLD OF ADMIRABLE WORKMANSHIP
1349-135891-0020 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COURT THERE WAS A FOUNTAIN FACED WITH WHITE MARBLE AND FULL OF CLEAR WATER WHICH WAS COPIOUSLY SUPPLIED OUT OF THE MOUTH OF A LION OF BRASS THE PORTER THOUGH HEAVY LADEN COULD NOT BUT ADMIRE THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THIS HOUSE
1349-135891-0021 AND THE EXCELLENT ORDER IN WHICH EVERY THING WAS PLACED BUT WHAT PARTICULARLY CAPTIVATED HIS ATTENTION WAS A THIRD LADY WHO SEEMED TO BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE SECOND AND WAS SEATED UPON THE THRONE JUST MENTIONED
1349-135891-0022 SHE DESCENDED AS SOON AS SHE SAW THE TWO OTHERS AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THEM HE JUDGED BY THE RESPECT WHICH THE OTHER LADIES SHOWED HER THAT SHE WAS THE CHIEF IN WHICH HE WAS NOT MISTAKEN
1349-135891-0023 AND SHE WHO WENT TO BUY THE PROVISIONS WAS NAMED AMENE
1349-135891-0024 THEN AMENE AND SAFIE TOOK THE BASKET THE ONE BEFORE AND THE OTHER BEHIND ZOBEIDE ALSO ASSISTED
1349-135891-0025 THEN EMPTIED IT AND WHEN THEY HAD DONE THE BEAUTIFUL AMENE TOOK OUT MONEY AND PAID THE PORTER LIBERALLY THE PORTER WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH THE MONEY HE HAD RECEIVED BUT WHEN HE OUGHT TO HAVE DEPARTED HE COULD NOT SUMMON SUFFICIENT RESOLUTION FOR THE PURPOSE
1349-135891-0026 HE WAS CHAINED TO THE SPOT BY THE PLEASURE OF BEHOLDING THREE SUCH BEAUTIES WHO APPEARED TO HIM EQUALLY CHARMING FOR AMENE HAVING NOW LAID ASIDE HER VEIL PROVED TO BE AS HANDSOME AS EITHER OF THE OTHERS
1349-135891-0027 WHAT SURPRISED HIM MOST WAS THAT HE SAW NO MAN ABOUT THE HOUSE YET MOST OF THE PROVISIONS HE HAD BROUGHT IN AS THE DRY FRUITS AND THE SEVERAL SORTS OF CAKES AND CONFECTIONS WERE ADAPTED CHIEFLY FOR THOSE WHO COULD DRINK AND MAKE MERRY
1349-135891-0028 AND TURNING TO AMENE SHE CONTINUED SISTER GIVE HIM SOMETHING MORE THAT HE MAY DEPART SATISFIED MADAM REPLIED THE PORTER IT IS NOT THAT WHICH DETAINS ME I AM ALREADY MORE THAN PAID FOR MY SERVICES I AM SENSIBLE THAT I ACT RUDELY IN STAYING LONGER THAN I OUGHT
1349-135891-0029 THAT I AM ASTONISHED NOT TO SEE A MAN WITH THREE LADIES OF SUCH EXTRAORDINARY BEAUTY AND YOU KNOW THAT A COMPANY OF WOMEN WITHOUT MEN IS AS MELANCHOLY AS A COMPANY OF MEN WITHOUT WOMEN TO THIS HE ADDED SEVERAL OTHER PLEASANT THINGS TO PROVE WHAT HE SAID
1349-135891-0030 AND DID NOT FORGET THE BAGDAD PROVERB THAT THE TABLE IS NOT COMPLETELY FURNISHED EXCEPT THERE BE FOUR IN COMPANY AND SO CONCLUDED THAT SINCE THEY WERE BUT THREE THEY WANTED ANOTHER
1349-135891-0031 AND THOUGH YOU DO NOT DESERVE THAT I SHOULD ENTER INTO ANY EXPLANATION WITH YOU I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE THREE SISTERS WHO TRANSACT OUR AFFAIRS WITH SO MUCH SECRECY THAT NO ONE KNOWS ANY THING OF THEM
1349-135891-0032 WE HAVE BUT TOO MUCH REASON TO BE CAUTIOUS OF ACQUAINTING INDISCREET PERSONS WITH OUR COUNSEL AND A GOOD AUTHOR THAT WE HAVE READ SAYS KEEP THY OWN SECRET AND DO NOT REVEAL IT TO ANY ONE HE THAT MAKES HIS SECRET KNOWN IT NO LONGER ITS MASTER
1349-135891-0033 IF THY OWN BREAST CANNOT KEEP THY COUNSEL HOW CANST THOU EXPECT THE BREAST OF ANOTHER TO BE MORE FAITHFUL MY LADIES REPLIED THE PORTER BY YOUR VERY AIR I JUDGED AT FIRST THAT YOU WERE PERSONS OF EXTRAORDINARY MERIT
1349-135891-0034 AND I CONCEIVE THAT I AM NOT MISTAKEN THOUGH FORTUNE HAS NOT GIVEN ME WEALTH ENOUGH TO RAISE ME ABOVE MY MEAN PROFESSION YET I HAVE NOT OMITTED TO CULTIVATE MY MIND AS MUCH AS I COULD BY READING BOOKS OF SCIENCE AND HISTORY AND ALLOW ME I BESEECH YOU
1349-135891-0035 TO SAY THAT I HAVE ALSO READ IN ANOTHER AUTHOR A MAXIM WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS HAPPILY FOLLOWED WE CONCEAL OUR SECRET FROM SUCH PERSONS ONLY AS ARE KNOWN TO ALL THE WORLD TO WANT DISCRETION
1349-135891-0037 THE KEY OF WHICH IS LOST AND THE DOOR
1349-135891-0038 YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN MAKING PREPARATIONS TO REGALE OURSELVES AND THAT AS YOU HAVE SEEN AT A CONSIDERABLE EXPENSE IT IS NOT JUST THAT YOU SHOULD NOW PARTAKE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WITHOUT CONTRIBUTING TO THE COST
1349-135891-0039 THE BEAUTIFUL SAFIE SECONDED HER SISTER AND SAID TO THE PORTER FRIEND HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD THE COMMON SAYING IF YOU BRING SOMETHING WITH YOU YOU SHALL CARRY SOMETHING AWAY BUT IF YOU BRING NOTHING YOU SHALL DEPART EMPTY
1349-135891-0040 THE PORTER NOTWITHSTANDING HIS RHETORIC MUST IN ALL PROBABILITY HAVE RETIRED IN CONFUSION IF AMENE HAD NOT TAKEN HIS PART AND SAID TO ZOBEIDE AND SAFIE MY DEAR SISTERS I CONJURE YOU TO LET HIM REMAIN I NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT HE WILL AFFORD US SOME DIVERSION
1349-135891-0041 OF THIS YOU PERCEIVE HE IS CAPABLE I ASSURE YOU HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HIS READINESS HIS ALACRITY AND COURAGE TO FOLLOW ME I COULD NOT HAVE DONE SO MUCH BUSINESS IN SO SHORT A TIME
1349-135891-0042 MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY YOU BEGAN MY GOOD FORTUNE TO DAY AND NOW YOU COMPLETE IT BY THIS GENEROUS CONDUCT I CANNOT ADEQUATELY EXPRESS MY ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
1349-135891-0043 NO I SHALL ALWAYS LOOK UPON MYSELF AS ONE OF YOUR MOST HUMBLE SLAVES
1349-135891-0044 WHAT WE HAVE ONCE GIVEN SAID SHE TO REWARD THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED US WE NEVER TAKE BACK MY FRIEND IN CONSENTING TO YOUR STAYING WITH US I MUST FOREWARN YOU THAT IT IS NOT THE ONLY CONDITION WE IMPOSE UPON YOU THAT YOU KEEP INVIOLABLE
1349-135891-0045 THE SECRET WE MAY ENTRUST TO YOU BUT WE ALSO REQUIRE YOU TO ATTEND TO THE STRICTEST RULES OF GOOD MANNERS DURING THIS ADDRESS THE CHARMING AMENE PUT OFF THE APPAREL SHE WENT ABROAD WITH AND FASTENED HER ROBE TO HER GIRDLE THAT SHE MIGHT ACT WITH THE GREATER FREEDOM
1349-135892-0000 LOST MY RIGHT EYE AND WHY I WAS OBLIGED TO PUT MYSELF INTO A CALENDER'S HABIT I MUST TELL YOU THAT I AM A SULTAN'S SON BORN MY FATHER HAD A BROTHER WHO REIGNED OVER A NEIGHBOURING KINGDOM
1349-135892-0001 AND THE PRINCE HIS SON AND I WERE NEARLY OF THE SAME AGE AFTER I HAD LEARNED MY EXERCISES THE SULTAN MY FATHER GRANTED ME SUCH LIBERTY AS SUITED MY DIGNITY I WENT REGULARLY EVERY YEAR TO SEE MY UNCLE
1349-135892-0002 AT WHOSE COURT I AMUSED MYSELF FOR A MONTH OR TWO AND THEN RETURNED AGAIN TO MY FATHER'S THESE JOURNEYS CEMENTED A FIRM AND INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE PRINCE MY COUSIN AND MYSELF
1349-135892-0003 THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM HE RECEIVED ME WITH GREATER DEMONSTRATIONS OF TENDERNESS THAN HE HAD DONE AT ANY TIME BEFORE AND RESOLVING ONE DAY TO GIVE ME A TREAT HE MADE GREAT PREPARATIONS FOR THAT PURPOSE
1349-135892-0004 WE CONTINUED A LONG TIME AT TABLE AND AFTER WE HAD BOTH SUPPED COUSIN SAID HE YOU WILL HARDLY BE ABLE TO GUESS HOW I HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED SINCE YOUR LAST DEPARTURE FROM HENCE ABOUT A YEAR PAST
1349-135892-0005 I HAVE HAD A GREAT MANY MEN AT WORK TO PERFECT A DESIGN I HAVE FORMED I HAVE CAUSED AN EDIFICE TO BE BUILT WHICH IS NOW FINISHED SO AS TO BE HABITABLE YOU WILL NOT BE DISPLEASED IF I SHEW IT YOU
1349-135892-0006 BUT FIRST YOU ARE TO PROMISE ME UPON OATH THAT YOU WILL KEEP MY SECRET ACCORDING TO THE CONFIDENCE I REPOSE IN YOU THE AFFECTION AND FAMILIARITY THAT SUBSISTED BETWEEN US WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO REFUSE HIM ANY THING
1349-135892-0007 I VERY READILY TOOK THE OATH REQUIRED OF ME UPON WHICH HE SAID TO ME STAY HERE TILL I RETURN I WILL BE WITH YOU IN A MOMENT AND ACCORDINGLY HE CAME WITH A LADY IN HIS HAND OF SINGULAR BEAUTY AND MAGNIFICENTLY APPARELLED
1349-135892-0008 HE DID NOT INTIMATE WHO SHE WAS NEITHER DID I THINK IT WOULD BE POLITE TO ENQUIRE WE SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH THIS LADY AT TABLE WHERE WE CONTINUED SOME TIME CONVERSING UPON INDIFFERENT SUBJECTS
1349-135892-0009 AND NOW AND THEN FILLING A GLASS TO EACH OTHER'S HEALTH AFTER WHICH THE PRINCE SAID COUSIN WE MUST LOSE NO TIME THEREFORE PRAY OBLIGE ME BY TAKING THIS LADY ALONG WITH YOU AND CONDUCTING HER TO SUCH A PLACE
1349-135892-0010 WHERE YOU WILL SEE A TOMB NEWLY BUILT IN FORM OF A DOME YOU WILL EASILY KNOW IT THE GATE IS OPEN ENTER IT TOGETHER AND TARRY TILL I COME WHICH WILL BE VERY SPEEDILY BEING TRUE TO MY OATH I MADE NO FARTHER ENQUIRY
1349-135892-0011 BUT TOOK THE LADY BY THE HAND AND BY THE DIRECTIONS WHICH THE PRINCE MY COUSIN HAD GIVEN ME
1349-135892-0012 WE WERE SCARCELY GOT THITHER WHEN WE SAW THE PRINCE FOLLOWING US CARRYING A PITCHER OF WATER A HATCHET AND A LITTLE BAG OF MORTAR THE HATCHET SERVED HIM TO BREAK DOWN THE EMPTY SEPULCHRE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOMB
1349-135892-0013 HE TOOK AWAY THE STONES ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND LAID THEM IN A CORNER HE THEN DUG UP THE GROUND WHERE I SAW A TRAP DOOR UNDER THE SEPULCHRE WHICH HE LIFTED UP AND UNDERNEATH PERCEIVED
1349-135892-0014 THE HEAD OF A STAIRCASE LEADING INTO A VAULT THEN MY COUSIN SPEAKING TO THE LADY SAID MADAM IT IS BY THIS WAY THAT WE ARE TO GO TO THE PLACE I TOLD YOU OF
1349-135892-0015 UPON WHICH THE LADY ADVANCED AND WENT DOWN AND THE PRINCE BEGAN TO FOLLOW BUT FIRST TURNING TO ME SAID MY DEAR COUSIN I AM INFINITELY OBLIGED TO YOU FOR THE TROUBLE YOU HAVE TAKEN I THANK YOU ADIEU DEAR COUSIN I CRIED WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS
1349-135892-0016 I COULD GET NOTHING FARTHER FROM HIM BUT WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE MY LEAVE AS I RETURNED TO MY UNCLE'S PALACE THE VAPOURS OF THE WINE GOT UP INTO MY HEAD HOWEVER I REACHED MY APARTMENT AND WENT TO BED
1349-135892-0017 NEXT MORNING WHEN I AWOKE I BEGAN TO REFLECT UPON WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFTER RECOLLECTING ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SUCH A SINGULAR ADVENTURE I FANCIED IT WAS NOTHING BUT A DREAM
1349-135892-0018 FULL OF THESE THOUGHTS I SENT TO ENQUIRE IF THE PRINCE MY COUSIN WAS READY TO RECEIVE A VISIT FROM ME
1349-135892-0019 THAT THEY KNEW NOT WHAT WAS BECOME OF HIM AND WERE IN MUCH TROUBLE IN CONSEQUENCE I CONCEIVED THAT THE STRANGE EVENT OF THE TOMB WAS TOO TRUE I WAS SENSIBLY AFFLICTED
1349-135892-0020 AND WENT TO THE PUBLIC BURYING PLACE WHERE THERE WERE SEVERAL TOMBS LIKE THAT WHICH I HAD SEEN I SPENT THE DAY IN VIEWING THEM ONE AFTER ANOTHER BUT COULD NOT FIND THAT I SOUGHT FOR AND THUS I SPENT FOUR DAYS SUCCESSIVELY IN VAIN
1349-135892-0021 YOU MUST KNOW THAT ALL THIS WHILE THE SULTAN MY UNCLE WAS ABSENT AND HAD BEEN HUNTING FOR SEVERAL DAYS I GREW WEARY OF WAITING FOR HIM
1349-135892-0022 AND HAVING PRAYED HIS MINISTERS TO MAKE MY APOLOGY AT HIS RETURN LEFT HIS PALACE AND SET OUT TOWARDS MY FATHER'S COURT I LEFT THE MINISTERS OF THE SULTAN MY UNCLE IN GREAT TROUBLE SURMISING WHAT WAS BECOME OF THE PRINCE
1349-135892-0023 BUT BECAUSE OF MY OATH TO KEEP HIS SECRET I DURST NOT TELL THEM WHAT I HAD SEEN I ARRIVED AT MY FATHER'S CAPITAL WHERE CONTRARY TO CUSTOM I FOUND A NUMEROUS GUARD AT THE GATE OF THE PALACE WHO SURROUNDED ME AS I ENTERED
1349-135892-0024 I ASKED THE REASON AND THE COMMANDING OFFICER REPLIED
1349-135892-0025 THIS REBEL VIZIER HAD LONG ENTERTAINED A MORTAL HATRED AGAINST ME FOR THIS REASON
1349-135892-0026 AND BEING ONE DAY UPON THE TERRACE OF THE PALACE WITH MY BOW A BIRD HAPPENING TO COME BY I SHOT BUT MISSED HIM AND THE BALL BY MISFORTUNE HIT THE VIZIER WHO WAS TAKING THE AIR UPON THE TERRACE OF HIS OWN HOUSE
1349-135892-0027 AND PUT OUT ONE OF HIS EYES AS SOON AS I UNDERSTOOD THIS I NOT ONLY SENT TO MAKE MY EXCUSE TO HIM BUT DID IT IN PERSON YET HE NEVER FORGAVE ME AND AS OPPORTUNITY OFFERED MADE ME SENSIBLE
1349-135892-0028 OF HIS RESENTMENT BUT NOW THAT HE HAD ME IN HIS POWER HE EXPRESSED HIS FEELINGS
1349-135892-0029 AND THUS I BECAME BLIND OF ONE EYE BUT THE USURPER'S CRUELTY DID NOT STOP HERE HE ORDERED ME TO BE SHUT UP IN A MACHINE AND COMMANDED THE EXECUTIONER TO CARRY ME INTO THE COUNTRY TO CUT OFF MY HEAD
1349-135892-0030 AND LEAVE ME TO BE DEVOURED BY BIRDS OF PREY THE EXECUTIONER CONVEYED ME THUS SHUT UP INTO THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THE BARBAROUS SENTENCE BUT BY MY PRAYERS AND TEARS I MOVED THE MAN'S COMPASSION
1349-135892-0031 I THANKED HIM FOR THE FAVOUR HE DID ME AND AS SOON AS I WAS LEFT ALONE COMFORTED MYSELF FOR THE LOSS OF MY EYE BY CONSIDERING THAT I HAD VERY NARROWLY ESCAPED A MUCH GREATER EVIL
1349-135892-0032 BEING IN SUCH A CONDITION I COULD NOT TRAVEL FAR AT A TIME I RETIRED TO REMOTE PLACES DURING THE DAY AND TRAVELLED AS FAR BY NIGHT AS MY STRENGTH WOULD ALLOW ME
1349-135892-0033 AND CAME TO HIS CAPITAL I GAVE HIM A LONG DETAIL OF THE TRAGICAL CAUSE OF MY RETURN AND OF THE SAD CONDITION HE SAW ME IN ALAS CRIED HE WAS IT NOT ENOUGH FOR ME TO HAVE LOST MY SON
1349-135892-0034 BUT MUST I HAVE ALSO NEWS OF THE DEATH OF A BROTHER I LOVED SO DEARLY AND SEE YOU REDUCED TO THIS DEPLORABLE CONDITION HE TOLD ME HOW UNEASY HE WAS THAT HE COULD HEAR NOTHING OF HIS SON NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE ENQUIRY HE COULD MAKE
1349-135892-0035 AT THESE WORDS THE UNFORTUNATE FATHER BURST INTO TEARS AND WAS SO MUCH AFFLICTED THAT PITYING HIS GRIEF IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO KEEP THE SECRET ANY LONGER SO THAT NOTWITHSTANDING MY OATH TO THE PRINCE MY COUSIN I TOLD THE SULTAN
1349-135892-0036 HIS MAJESTY LISTENED TO ME WITH SOME SORT OF COMFORT AND WHEN I HAD DONE NEPHEW SAID HE WHAT YOU TELL ME GIVES ME SOME HOPE I KNEW THAT MY SON ORDERED THAT TOMB TO BE BUILT AND I CAN GUESS PRETTY NEARLY THE PLACE
1349-135892-0037 AND WITH THE IDEA YOU STILL HAVE OF IT I FANCY WE SHALL FIND IT BUT SINCE HE ORDERED IT TO BE BUILT PRIVATELY AND YOU TOOK YOUR OATH TO KEEP HIS SECRET I AM OF OPINION THAT WE OUGHT TO GO IN QUEST OF IT WITHOUT OTHER ATTENDANTS
1349-135892-0038 BUT HE HAD ANOTHER REASON FOR KEEPING THE MATTER SECRET WHICH HE DID NOT THEN TELL ME AND AN IMPORTANT ONE IT WAS AS YOU WILL PERCEIVE BY THE SEQUEL OF MY STORY
1349-135892-0039 WE DISGUISED OURSELVES AND WENT OUT BY A DOOR OF THE GARDEN WHICH OPENED INTO THE FIELDS AND SOON FOUND WHAT WE SOUGHT FOR I KNEW THE TOMB AND WAS THE MORE REJOICED BECAUSE I HAD FORMERLY SOUGHT IT A LONG TIME IN VAIN
1349-135892-0040 WE ENTERED AND FOUND THE IRON TRAP PULLED DOWN AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRCASE
1349-135892-0041 FROM THIS ANTECHAMBER WE CAME INTO ANOTHER VERY LARGE SUPPORTED BY COLUMNS AND LIGHTED BY SEVERAL BRANCHED CANDLESTICKS THERE WAS A CISTERN IN THE MIDDLE AND PROVISIONS OF SEVERAL SORTS STOOD ON ONE SIDE OF IT BUT WE WERE MUCH SURPRISED NOT TO SEE ANY PERSON
1349-135892-0042 THE SULTAN WENT UP AND OPENING THE CURTAINS PERCEIVED THE PRINCE HIS SON AND THE LADY IN BED TOGETHER BUT BURNT AND CHANGED TO CINDER AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THROWN INTO A FIRE AND TAKEN OUT BEFORE THEY WERE CONSUMED
1349-135892-0043 BUT WHAT SURPRISED ME MOST WAS THAT THOUGH THIS SPECTACLE FILLED ME WITH HORROR THE SULTAN MY UNCLE INSTEAD OF TESTIFYING HIS SORROW TO SEE THE PRINCE HIS SON IN SUCH A CONDITION
1349-135892-0044 SPAT ON HIS FACE AND EXCLAIMED WITH A DISDAINFUL AIR THIS IS THE PUNISHMENT OF THIS WORLD BUT THAT OF THE OTHER WILL LAST TO ETERNITY AND NOT CONTENT WITH THIS HE PULLED OFF HIS SANDAL
1349-135892-0045 AND GAVE THE CORPSE OF HIS SON A BLOW ON THE CHEEK I CANNOT ADEQUATELY EXPRESS HOW MUCH I WAS ASTONISHED WHEN I SAW THE SULTAN MY UNCLE ABUSE HIS SON THUS AFTER HE WAS DEAD SIR SAID I WHATEVER GRIEF THIS DISMAL SIGHT HAS IMPRESSED UPON ME
1349-135892-0046 I AM FORCED TO SUSPEND IT TO ENQUIRE OF YOUR MAJESTY WHAT CRIME THE PRINCE MY COUSIN MAY HAVE COMMITTED THAT HIS CORPSE SHOULD DESERVE SUCH INDIGNANT TREATMENT
1349-135892-0047 AS SHE DID HIM I DID NOT CHECK THEIR GROWING FONDNESS BECAUSE I DID NOT FORESEE ITS PERNICIOUS CONSEQUENCE THIS TENDERNESS INCREASED AS THEY GREW IN YEARS AND TO SUCH A HEIGHT THAT I DREADED THE END OF IT AT LAST I APPLIED SUCH REMEDIES AS WERE IN MY POWER
1349-135892-0048 I NOT ONLY GAVE MY SON A SEVERE REPRIMAND IN PRIVATE LAYING BEFORE HIM THE HORRIBLE NATURE OF THE PASSION HE ENTERTAINED
1349-135892-0049 AND THE ETERNAL DISGRACE HE WOULD BRING UPON MY FAMILY IF HE PERSISTED BUT I ALSO REPRESENTED THE SAME TO MY DAUGHTER AND SHUT HER UP SO CLOSE THAT SHE COULD HAVE NO CONVERSATION WITH HER BROTHER BUT THAT UNFORTUNATE CREATURE HAD SWALLOWED SO MUCH OF THE POISON
1349-135892-0050 THAT ALL THE OBSTACLES WHICH BY MY PRUDENCE I COULD LAY IN THE WAY SERVED ONLY TO INFLAME HER LOVE MY SON BEING PERSUADED OF HIS SISTER'S CONSTANCY ON PRESENCE OF BUILDING A TOMB CAUSED THIS SUBTERRANEOUS HABITATION TO BE MADE
1349-135892-0051 IN HOPES OF FINDING ONE DAY OR OTHER AN OPPORTUNITY TO POSSESS HIMSELF OF THAT OBJETS WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS FLAME AND TO BRING HER HITHER HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY ABSENCE
1349-135892-0052 TO ENTER BY FORCE INTO THE PLACE OF HIS SISTER'S CONFINEMENT BUT THIS WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH MY HONOUR WOULD NOT SUFFER ME TO MAKE PUBLIC AND AFTER SO DAMNABLE AN ACTION HE CAME AND SHUT HIMSELF UP WITH HER IN THIS PLACE
1349-135892-0053 WHICH HE HAS SUPPLIED AS YOU SEE WITH ALL SORTS OF PROVISIONS THAT HE MIGHT ENJOY DETESTABLE PLEASURES WHICH OUGHT TO BE A SUBJECT OF HORROR TO ALL THE WORLD BUT GOD
1349-135892-0054 WHO WOULD NOT SUFFER SUCH AN ABOMINATION HAS JUSTLY PUNISHED THEM BOTH AT THESE WORDS HE MELTED INTO TEARS AND I JOINED MINE WITH HIS AFTER A WHILE CASTING HIS EYES UPON ME DEAR NEPHEW CRIED HE EMBRACING ME
1349-135892-0055 IF I HAVE LOST THAT UNWORTHY SON I SHALL HAPPILY FIND IN YOU WHAT WILL BETTER SUPPLY HIS PLACE THE REFLECTIONS HE MADE ON THE DOLEFUL END OF THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS HIS DAUGHTER MADE US BOTH WEEP AFRESH
1349-135892-0056 WE ASCENDED THE STAIRS AGAIN AND DEPARTED AT LAST FROM THAT DISMAL PLACE WE LET DOWN THE TRAP DOOR
1349-135892-0057 SO TERRIBLE AN EFFECT OF THE WRATH OF GOD WE HAD NOT BEEN LONG RETURNED TO THE PALACE UNPERCEIVED BY ANY ONE BUT WE HEARD A CONFUSED NOISE OF TRUMPETS DRUMS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS OF WAR
1349-135892-0058 WE SOON UNDERSTOOD BY THE THICK CLOUD OF DUST WHICH ALMOST DARKENED THE AIR THAT IT WAS THE ARRIVAL OF A FORMIDABLE ARMY
1349-135892-0059 AND USURPED HIS PLACE WHO WITH A VAST NUMBER OF TROOPS WAS COME TO POSSESS HIMSELF OF THAT ALSO OF THE SULTAN MY UNCLE MY UNCLE WHO THEN HAD ONLY HIS USUAL GUARDS ABOUT HIM COULD NOT RESIST SO NUMEROUS AN ENEMY
1349-135892-0060 THEY INVESTED THE CITY AND THE GATES BEING OPENED TO THEM WITHOUT ANY RESISTANCE SOON BECAME MASTERS OF IT AND BROKE INTO THE PALACE WHERE MY UNCLE DEFENDED HIMSELF AND SOLD HIS LIFE AT A DEAR RATE
1349-135892-0061 I FOUGHT AS VALIANTLY FOR A WHILE BUT SEEING WE WERE FORCED TO SUBMIT TO A SUPERIOR POWER I THOUGHT ON MY RETREAT WHICH I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO EFFECT BY SOME BACK WAYS
1349-135892-0062 WHICH WAS THE ONLY MEANS LEFT ME TO SAVE MY LIFE I CAUSED MY BEARD AND EYE BROWS TO BE SHAVED AND PUTTING ON A CALENDER'S HABIT I PASSED UNKNOWN BY ANY OUT OF THE CITY AFTER THAT BY DEGREES I FOUND IT EASY TO QUIT
1349-135892-0063 MY UNCLE'S KINGDOM BY TAKING THE BYE ROADS
1349-135892-0064 AND CONSIDERING WHAT I WAS TO DO I RESOLVED TO COME TO BAGDAD INTENDING TO THROW MYSELF AT THE FEET OF THAT MONARCH WHOSE GENEROSITY IS RENOWNED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD I SHALL MOVE HIM TO COMPASSION SAID I TO MYSELF
1349-135892-0065 BY THE RELATION OF MY UNCOMMON MISFORTUNES AND WITHOUT DOUBT HE WILL TAKE PITY ON A PERSECUTED PRINCE AND NOT SUFFER ME TO IMPLORE HIS ASSISTANCE IN VAIN IN SHORT
1349-135892-0066 AFTER A JOURNEY OF SEVERAL MONTHS I ARRIVED YESTERDAY AT THE GATE OF THIS CITY INTO WHICH I ENTERED ABOUT THE DUSK OF EVENING AND STOPPING A LITTLE WHILE TO CONSIDER WHICH WAY I WAS TO TURN ANOTHER CALENDER CAME UP HE SALUTED ME AND I HIM
1349-135892-0067 YOU APPEAR SAID I TO BE A STRANGER AS I AM YOU ARE NOT MISTAKEN REPLIED HE HE HAD NO SOONER RETURNED THIS ANSWER THAN A THIRD CALENDER OVERTOOK US HE SALUTED US AND TOLD US HE WAS A STRANGER NEWLY COME TO BAGDAD
1349-135892-0068 SO THAT AS BRETHREN WE JOINED TOGETHER RESOLVING NOT TO SEPARATE FROM ONE ANOTHER IT WAS NOW LATE AND WE KNEW NOT WHERE TO SEEK A LODGING IN THE CITY WHERE WE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE BUT GOOD FORTUNE HAVING BROUGHT US TO YOUR GATE WE MADE BOLD TO KNOCK
1349-135892-0069 WHEN YOU RECEIVED US WITH SO MUCH KINDNESS THAT WE ARE INCAPABLE OF RENDERING SUITABLE THANKS THIS MADAM SAID HE IS IN OBEDIENCE TO YOUR COMMANDS THE ACCOUNT I WAS TO GIVE HOW I LOST MY RIGHT EYE
1349-135892-0070 WHEREFORE MY BEARD AND EYE BROWS ARE SHAVED AND HOW I CAME TO BE WITH YOU AT THIS TIME IT IS ENOUGH SAID ZOBEIDE YOU MAY RETIRE TO WHAT PLACE YOU THINK FIT
1349-135892-0071 THE CALENDER BEGGED THE LADIES PERMISSION TO STAY TILL HE HAD HEARD THE RELATIONS OF HIS TWO COMRADES WHOM I CANNOT SAID HE LEAVE WITH HONOUR AND THAT HE MIGHT ALSO HEAR THOSE OF THE THREE OTHER PERSONS IN COMPANY
1349-135892-0072 THE STORY OF THE FIRST CALENDER SEEMED WONDERFUL TO THE WHOLE COMPANY BUT ESPECIALLY TO THE CALIPH WHO NOTWITHSTANDING THE SLAVES STOOD BY WITH THEIR CIMETERS DRAWN COULD NOT FORBEAR WHISPERING TO THE VIZIER
1349-135892-0073 MANY STORIES HAVE I HEARD BUT NEVER ANY THAT EQUALLED IN SURPRISING INCIDENT THAT OF THE CALENDER
1365-134804-0000 CHAPTER FIVE VAGUE FLASHES ON THE HORIZON LITTLE BY LITTLE AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME ALL THIS OPPOSITION SUBSIDED
1365-134804-0001 AND TOWARDS EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE THE MOMENT ARRIVED WHEN THE WORD MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
1365-134804-0002 HE PUT AN END TO DIFFERENCES HE PREVENTED LAWSUITS HE RECONCILED ENEMIES EVERY ONE TOOK HIM FOR THE JUDGE AND WITH GOOD REASON IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE HAD FOR A SOUL THE BOOK OF THE NATURAL LAW IT WAS LIKE AN EPIDEMIC OF VENERATION
1365-134804-0003 WHICH IN THE COURSE OF SIX OR SEVEN YEARS GRADUALLY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE DISTRICT ONE SINGLE MAN IN THE TOWN IN THE ARRONDISSEMENT ABSOLUTELY ESCAPED THIS CONTAGION AND WHATEVER FATHER MADELEINE DID
1365-134804-0004 REMAINED HIS OPPONENT AS THOUGH A SORT OF INCORRUPTIBLE AND IMPERTURBABLE INSTINCT KEPT HIM ON THE ALERT AND UNEASY IT SEEMS IN FACT
1365-134804-0005 THOUGH PURE AND UPRIGHT LIKE ALL INSTINCTS WHICH CREATES ANTIPATHIES AND SYMPATHIES WHICH FATALLY SEPARATES ONE NATURE FROM ANOTHER NATURE WHICH DOES NOT HESITATE WHICH FEELS NO DISQUIET
1365-134804-0006 INFALLIBLE IMPERIOUS INTRACTABLE STUBBORN TO ALL COUNSELS OF THE INTELLIGENCE AND TO ALL THE DISSOLVENTS OF REASON AND WHICH IN WHATEVER MANNER DESTINIES ARE ARRANGED SECRETLY WARNS THE MAN DOG OF THE PRESENCE OF THE MAN CAT
1365-134804-0007 AND THE MAN FOX OF THE PRESENCE OF THE MAN LION
1365-134804-0008 CALM AFFECTIONATE SURROUNDED BY THE BLESSINGS OF ALL A MAN OF LOFTY STATURE CLAD IN AN IRON GRAY FROCK COAT ARMED WITH A HEAVY CANE AND WEARING A BATTERED HAT TURNED ROUND ABRUPTLY BEHIND HIM AND FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES UNTIL HE DISAPPEARED
1365-134804-0009 WITH FOLDED ARMS AND A SLOW SHAKE OF THE HEAD AND HIS UPPER LIP RAISED IN COMPANY WITH HIS LOWER TO HIS NOSE A SORT OF SIGNIFICANT GRIMACE WHICH MIGHT BE TRANSLATED BY WHAT IS THAT MAN AFTER ALL
1365-134804-0010 I CERTAINLY HAVE SEEN HIM SOMEWHERE IN ANY CASE I AM NOT HIS DUPE THIS PERSON GRAVE WITH A GRAVITY WHICH WAS ALMOST MENACING WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO
1365-134804-0011 EVEN WHEN ONLY SEEN BY A RAPID GLIMPSE ARREST THE SPECTATOR'S ATTENTION HIS NAME WAS JAVERT AND HE BELONGED TO THE POLICE
1365-134804-0012 HE HAD NOT SEEN MADELEINE'S BEGINNINGS JAVERT OWED THE POST WHICH HE OCCUPIED TO THE PROTECTION OF
1365-134804-0013 THEN PREFECT OF POLICE AT PARIS
1365-134804-0014 THE FORTUNE OF THE GREAT MANUFACTURER WAS ALREADY MADE AND FATHER MADELEINE HAD BECOME MONSIEUR MADELEINE CERTAIN POLICE OFFICERS HAVE A PECULIAR PHYSIOGNOMY WHICH IS COMPLICATED WITH AN AIR OF BASENESS MINGLED WITH AN AIR OF AUTHORITY
1365-134804-0015 MINUS THE BASENESS IT IS OUR CONVICTION THAT IF SOULS WERE VISIBLE TO THE EYES WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE DISTINCTLY THAT STRANGE THING THAT EACH ONE INDIVIDUAL OF THE HUMAN RACE CORRESPONDS TO SOME ONE OF THE SPECIES OF THE ANIMAL CREATION
1365-134804-0016 AND WE COULD EASILY RECOGNIZE THIS TRUTH HARDLY PERCEIVED BY THE THINKER THAT FROM THE OYSTER TO THE EAGLE FROM THE PIG TO THE TIGER ALL ANIMALS EXIST IN MAN AND THAT EACH ONE OF THEM IS IN A MAN
1365-134804-0017 THAT IS TO SAY THE POSSIBILITY OF EDUCATION SOCIAL EDUCATION WHEN WELL DONE CAN ALWAYS DRAW FROM A SOUL OF WHATEVER SORT IT MAY BE THE UTILITY WHICH IT CONTAINS THIS BE IT SAID
1365-134804-0018 IS OF COURSE FROM THE RESTRICTED POINT OF VIEW OF THE TERRESTRIAL LIFE WHICH IS APPARENT AND WITHOUT PREJUDGING THE PROFOUND QUESTION OF THE ANTERIOR OR ULTERIOR PERSONALITY OF THE BEINGS WHICH ARE NOT MAN THE VISIBLE I
1365-134804-0019 HAVING MADE THIS RESERVATION LET US PASS ON NOW IF THE READER WILL ADMIT FOR A MOMENT WITH US THAT IN EVERY MAN THERE IS ONE OF THE ANIMAL SPECIES OF CREATION
1365-134804-0020 WHICH IS KILLED BY THE MOTHER BECAUSE OTHERWISE AS HE GREW UP HE WOULD DEVOUR THE OTHER LITTLE ONES GIVE TO THIS DOG SON OF A WOLF A HUMAN FACE AND THE RESULT WILL BE JAVERT JAVERT HAD BEEN BORN IN PRISON OF A FORTUNE TELLER
1365-134804-0021 AND HE DESPAIRED OF EVER RE ENTERING IT HE OBSERVED THAT SOCIETY UNPARDONINGLY EXCLUDES TWO CLASSES OF MEN THOSE WHO ATTACK IT AND THOSE WHO GUARD IT HE HAD NO CHOICE EXCEPT BETWEEN THESE TWO CLASSES
1365-134804-0022 AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF AN INDESCRIBABLE FOUNDATION OF RIGIDITY REGULARITY AND PROBITY COMPLICATED WITH AN INEXPRESSIBLE HATRED FOR THE RACE OF BOHEMIANS WHENCE HE WAS SPRUNG HE ENTERED THE POLICE
1365-134804-0023 HE SUCCEEDED THERE AT FORTY YEARS OF AGE HE WAS AN INSPECTOR DURING HIS YOUTH HE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN THE CONVICT ESTABLISHMENTS OF THE SOUTH BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER
1365-134804-0024 HUMAN FACE WHICH WE HAVE JUST APPLIED TO JAVERT THE HUMAN FACE OF JAVERT CONSISTED OF A FLAT NOSE WITH TWO DEEP NOSTRILS TOWARDS WHICH ENORMOUS WHISKERS ASCENDED ON HIS CHEEKS
1365-134804-0025 BUT HIS GUMS AND AROUND HIS NOSE THERE FORMED A FLATTENED AND SAVAGE FOLD AS ON THE MUZZLE OF A WILD BEAST JAVERT SERIOUS WAS A WATCHDOG
1365-134804-0026 AS FOR THE REST HE HAD VERY LITTLE SKULL AND A GREAT DEAL OF JAW HIS HAIR CONCEALED HIS FOREHEAD AND FELL OVER HIS EYEBROWS BETWEEN HIS EYES THERE WAS A PERMANENT CENTRAL FROWN LIKE AN IMPRINT OF WRATH HIS GAZE WAS OBSCURE
1365-134804-0027 HIS MOUTH PURSED UP AND TERRIBLE HIS AIR THAT OF FEROCIOUS COMMAND THIS MAN WAS COMPOSED OF TWO VERY SIMPLE AND TWO VERY GOOD SENTIMENTS COMPARATIVELY BUT HE RENDERED THEM ALMOST BAD BY DINT OF EXAGGERATING THEM
1365-134804-0028 RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY HATRED OF REBELLION AND IN HIS EYES MURDER ROBBERY ALL CRIMES ARE ONLY FORMS OF REBELLION HE ENVELOPED IN A BLIND AND PROFOUND FAITH EVERY ONE WHO HAD A FUNCTION IN THE STATE
1365-134804-0029 FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE RURAL POLICEMAN HE COVERED WITH SCORN AVERSION AND DISGUST EVERY ONE WHO HAD ONCE CROSSED THE LEGAL THRESHOLD OF EVIL HE WAS ABSOLUTE AND ADMITTED NO EXCEPTIONS ON THE ONE HAND HE SAID
1365-134804-0030 THE FUNCTIONARY CAN MAKE NO MISTAKE THE MAGISTRATE IS NEVER THE WRONG ON THE OTHER HAND HE SAID THESE MEN ARE IRREMEDIABLY LOST NOTHING GOOD CAN COME FROM THEM
1365-134804-0031 HE FULLY SHARED THE OPINION OF THOSE EXTREME MINDS WHICH ATTRIBUTE TO HUMAN LAW I KNOW NOT WHAT POWER OF MAKING OR IF THE READER WILL HAVE IT SO OF AUTHENTICATING DEMONS AND WHO PLACE A STYX AT THE BASE OF SOCIETY
1365-134804-0032 HE WAS STOICAL SERIOUS AUSTERE A MELANCHOLY DREAMER HUMBLE AND HAUGHTY LIKE FANATICS HIS GLANCE WAS LIKE A GIMLET COLD AND PIERCING HIS WHOLE LIFE HUNG ON THESE TWO WORDS WATCHFULNESS
1365-134804-0033 AND SUPERVISION HE HAD INTRODUCED A STRAIGHT LINE INTO WHAT IS THE MOST CROOKED THING IN THE WORLD HE POSSESSED THE CONSCIENCE OF HIS USEFULNESS THE RELIGION OF HIS FUNCTIONS AND HE WAS A SPY AS OTHER MEN ARE PRIESTS
1365-134804-0034 WOE TO THE MAN WHO FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE WOULD HAVE ARRESTED HIS OWN FATHER IF THE LATTER HAD ESCAPED FROM THE GALLEYS AND WOULD HAVE DENOUNCED HIS MOTHER IF SHE HAD BROKEN HER BAN AND HE WOULD HAVE DONE IT WITH THAT SORT OF INWARD SATISFACTION WHICH IS CONFERRED BY VIRTUE
1365-134804-0035 AND WITHAL A LIFE OF PRIVATION ISOLATION ABNEGATION CHASTITY WITH NEVER A DIVERSION IT WAS IMPLACABLE DUTY THE POLICE UNDERSTOOD AS THE SPARTANS UNDERSTOOD SPARTA A PITILESS LYING IN WAIT
1365-134804-0036 A FEROCIOUS HONESTY A MARBLE INFORMER BRUTUS IN VIDOCQ JAVERT'S WHOLE PERSON WAS EXPRESSIVE OF THE MAN WHO SPIES AND WHO WITHDRAWS HIMSELF FROM OBSERVATION
1365-134804-0037 WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO DECLARE THAT JAVERT WAS A SYMBOL HIS BROW WAS NOT VISIBLE IT DISAPPEARED BENEATH HIS HAT HIS EYES WERE NOT VISIBLE SINCE THEY WERE LOST UNDER HIS EYEBROWS HIS CHIN WAS NOT VISIBLE
1365-134804-0038 HIS HANDS WERE NOT VISIBLE THEY WERE DRAWN UP IN HIS SLEEVES AND HIS CANE WAS NOT VISIBLE HE CARRIED IT UNDER HIS COAT BUT WHEN THE OCCASION PRESENTED ITSELF THERE WAS SUDDENLY SEEN TO EMERGE FROM ALL THIS SHADOW AS FROM AN AMBUSCADE
1365-134804-0039 THIS CAUSED HIM TO BE NOT WHOLLY ILLITERATE THIS COULD BE RECOGNIZED BY SOME EMPHASIS IN HIS SPEECH AS WE HAVE SAID HE HAD NO VICES WHEN HE WAS PLEASED WITH HIMSELF HE PERMITTED HIMSELF A PINCH OF SNUFF
1365-134804-0040 AN EYE FULL OF SUSPICION AND CONJECTURE
1365-134804-0041 ALL THE ANTERIOR TRACES WHICH FATHER MADELEINE MIGHT HAVE LEFT ELSEWHERE HE SEEMED TO KNOW AND HE SOMETIMES SAID IN COVERT WORDS THAT SOME ONE HAD GLEANED CERTAIN INFORMATION IN A CERTAIN DISTRICT ABOUT A FAMILY WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED
1365-134804-0042 ONCE HE CHANCED TO SAY AS HE WAS TALKING TO HIMSELF I THINK I HAVE HIM THEN HE REMAINED PENSIVE FOR THREE DAYS AND UTTERED NOT A WORD IT SEEMED THAT THE THREAD WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HELD HAD BROKEN MOREOVER
1365-134804-0043 AND THIS FURNISHES THE NECESSARY CORRECTIVE FOR THE TOO ABSOLUTE SENSE WHICH CERTAIN WORDS MIGHT PRESENT THERE CAN BE NOTHING REALLY INFALLIBLE IN A HUMAN CREATURE AND THE PECULIARITY OF INSTINCT IS THAT IT CAN BECOME CONFUSED THROWN OFF THE TRACK AND DEFEATED
1365-134804-0044 ONE DAY NEVERTHELESS
1365-134825-0000 HIS COAT WAS CAREFULLY BUTTONED HE WAS VERY PALE AND HE TREMBLED SLIGHTLY
1365-134825-0001 THE MAN WHO STOOD THERE APPEARED SO CALM THAT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND AT FIRST THEY ASKED THEMSELVES WHETHER HE HAD INDEED UTTERED THAT CRY THEY COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT TRANQUIL MAN HAD BEEN THE ONE TO GIVE THAT TERRIBLE OUTCRY
1365-134825-0002 THIS INDECISION ONLY LASTED A FEW SECONDS EVEN BEFORE THE PRESIDENT AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY COULD UTTER A WORD BEFORE THE USHERS AND THE GENDARMES COULD MAKE A GESTURE
1365-134825-0003 HAD ADVANCED TOWARDS THE WITNESSES COCHEPAILLE BREVET AND CHENILDIEU DO YOU NOT RECOGNIZE ME SAID HE ALL THREE REMAINED SPEECHLESS AND INDICATED BY A SIGN OF THE HEAD THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW HIM
1365-134825-0004 COCHEPAILLE WHO WAS INTIMIDATED MADE A MILITARY SALUTE
1365-134825-0005 NOT A MOUTH BREATHED THE FIRST COMMOTION OF ASTONISHMENT HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY A SILENCE LIKE THAT OF THE GRAVE THOSE WITHIN THE HALL EXPERIENCED THAT SORT OF RELIGIOUS TERROR WHICH SEIZES THE MASSES WHEN SOMETHING GRAND HAS BEEN DONE
1365-134825-0006 IN THE MEANTIME THE FACE OF THE PRESIDENT WAS STAMPED WITH SYMPATHY AND SADNESS HE HAD EXCHANGED A RAPID SIGN WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND A FEW LOW TONED WORDS WITH THE ASSISTANT JUDGES HE ADDRESSED THE PUBLIC
1365-134825-0007 THE VERY STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED INCIDENT WHICH DISTURBS THE AUDIENCE INSPIRES US LIKE YOURSELVES ONLY WITH A SENTIMENT WHICH IT IS UNNECESSARY FOR US TO EXPRESS
1365-134825-0008 HE INTERRUPTED HIM IN ACCENTS FULL OF SUAVITY AND AUTHORITY THESE ARE THE WORDS WHICH HE UTTERED HERE THEY ARE LITERALLY AS THEY WERE WRITTEN DOWN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TRIAL BY ONE OF THE WITNESSES TO THIS SCENE
1365-134825-0009 AND AS THEY NOW RING IN THE EARS OF THOSE WHO HEARD THEM NEARLY FORTY YEARS AGO I THANK YOU MISTER DISTRICT ATTORNEY BUT I AM NOT MAD YOU SHALL SEE YOU WERE ON THE POINT OF COMMITTING A GREAT ERROR RELEASE THIS MAN
1365-134825-0010 I AM FULFILLING A DUTY I AM THAT MISERABLE CRIMINAL I AM THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO SEES THE MATTER CLEARLY AND I AM TELLING YOU THE TRUTH GOD WHO IS ON HIGH LOOKS DOWN ON WHAT I AM DOING AT THIS MOMENT AND THAT SUFFICES
1365-134825-0011 IN SHORT THERE ARE MANY THINGS WHICH I CANNOT TELL I WILL NOT NARRATE THE STORY OF MY LIFE TO YOU YOU WILL HEAR IT ONE OF THESE DAYS I ROBBED MONSEIGNEUR THE BISHOP IT IS TRUE IT IS TRUE THAT I ROBBED LITTLE GERVAIS
1365-134825-0012 THEY WERE RIGHT IN TELLING YOU THAT JEAN VALJEAN WAS A VERY VICIOUS WRETCH PERHAPS IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER HIS FAULT LISTEN HONORABLE JUDGES A MAN WHO HAS BEEN SO GREATLY HUMBLED AS I HAVE HAS NEITHER ANY REMONSTRANCES TO MAKE TO PROVIDENCE
1365-134825-0013 NOR ANY ADVICE TO GIVE TO SOCIETY BUT YOU SEE THE INFAMY FROM WHICH I HAVE TRIED TO ESCAPE IS AN INJURIOUS THING THE GALLEYS MAKE THE CONVICT WHAT HE IS REFLECT UPON THAT IF YOU PLEASE
1365-134825-0014 BEFORE GOING TO THE GALLEYS I WAS A POOR PEASANT WITH VERY LITTLE INTELLIGENCE A SORT OF IDIOT THE GALLEYS WROUGHT A CHANGE IN ME I WAS STUPID I BECAME VICIOUS I WAS A BLOCK OF WOOD I BECAME A FIREBRAND
1365-134825-0015 LATER ON INDULGENCE AND KINDNESS SAVED ME AS SEVERITY HAD RUINED ME BUT PARDON ME YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING YOU WILL FIND AT MY HOUSE AMONG THE ASHES IN THE FIREPLACE
1365-134825-0016 THE FORTY SOU PIECE WHICH I STOLE SEVEN YEARS AGO FROM LITTLE GERVAIS I HAVE NOTHING FARTHER TO ADD TAKE ME GOOD GOD THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SHAKES HIS HEAD
1365-134825-0017 YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME THAT IS DISTRESSING DO NOT AT LEAST CONDEMN THIS MAN WHAT THESE MEN DO NOT RECOGNIZE ME I WISH JAVERT WERE HERE HE WOULD RECOGNIZE ME
1365-134825-0018 NOTHING CAN REPRODUCE THE SOMBRE AND KINDLY MELANCHOLY OF TONE WHICH ACCOMPANIED THESE WORDS HE TURNED TO THE THREE CONVICTS AND SAID WELL I RECOGNIZE YOU DO YOU REMEMBER BREVET HE PAUSED
1365-134825-0019 CHENILDIEU YOU WHO CONFERRED ON YOURSELF THE NAME OF JENIE DIEU YOUR WHOLE RIGHT SHOULDER BEARS A DEEP BURN BECAUSE YOU ONE DAY LAID YOUR SHOULDER AGAINST THE CHAFING DISH FULL OF COALS IN ORDER TO EFFACE THE THREE LETTERS T F P
1365-134825-0020 ALL EYES WERE FOCUSED ON HIM AND ON HIS BARE ARM A GENDARME HELD A LIGHT CLOSE TO IT THERE WAS THE DATE
1365-134825-0021 THE UNHAPPY MAN TURNED TO THE SPECTATORS AND THE JUDGES WITH A SMILE WHICH STILL RENDS THE HEARTS OF ALL WHO SAW IT WHENEVER THEY THINK OF IT IT WAS A SMILE OF TRIUMPH
1365-134825-0022 YOU SEE PLAINLY HE SAID THAT I AM JEAN VALJEAN IN THAT CHAMBER THERE WERE NO LONGER EITHER JUDGES ACCUSERS NOR GENDARMES THERE WAS NOTHING BUT STARING EYES AND SYMPATHIZING HEARTS
1365-134825-0023 NO ONE RECALLED ANY LONGER THE PART THAT EACH MIGHT BE CALLED UPON TO PLAY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FORGOT HE WAS THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROSECUTING THE PRESIDENT THAT HE WAS THERE TO PRESIDE THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE THAT HE WAS THERE TO DEFEND
1365-134825-0024 IT WAS A STRIKING CIRCUMSTANCE THAT NO QUESTION WAS PUT THAT NO AUTHORITY INTERVENED THE PECULIARITY OF SUBLIME SPECTACLES IS THAT THEY CAPTURE ALL SOULS AND TURN WITNESSES INTO SPECTATORS NO ONE PROBABLY
1365-134825-0025 COULD HAVE EXPLAINED WHAT HE FELT NO ONE PROBABLY SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS WITNESSING THE SPLENDID OUTBURST OF A GRAND LIGHT ALL FELT THEMSELVES INWARDLY DAZZLED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY HAD JEAN VALJEAN BEFORE THEIR EYES
1365-134825-0026 THAT WAS CLEAR THE APPEARANCE OF THIS MAN HAD SUFFICED TO SUFFUSE WITH LIGHT THAT MATTER WHICH HAD BEEN SO OBSCURE BUT A MOMENT PREVIOUSLY WITHOUT ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION THE WHOLE CROWD AS BY A SORT OF ELECTRIC REVELATION
1365-134825-0027 UNDERSTOOD INSTANTLY AND AT A SINGLE GLANCE THE SIMPLE AND MAGNIFICENT HISTORY OF A MAN WHO WAS DELIVERING HIMSELF UP SO THAT ANOTHER MAN MIGHT NOT BE CONDEMNED IN HIS STEAD THE DETAILS THE HESITATIONS LITTLE POSSIBLE OPPOSITIONS
1365-134825-0028 I SHALL WITHDRAW SINCE YOU DO NOT ARREST ME I HAVE MANY THINGS TO DO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY KNOWS WHO I AM HE KNOWS WHITHER I AM GOING HE CAN HAVE ME ARRESTED WHEN HE LIKES HE DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE DOOR
1365-134825-0029 IT WAS NEVER KNOWN WHO OPENED THE DOOR BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE FOUND THE DOOR OPEN WHEN HE REACHED IT ON ARRIVING THERE HE TURNED ROUND AND SAID I AM AT YOUR COMMAND MISTER DISTRICT ATTORNEY THEN HE ADDRESSED THE AUDIENCE ALL OF YOU
1365-134830-0000 THAT AT THE SINGLE WORD HE WAS A CONVICT NEARLY EVERY ONE DESERTED HIM IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS ALL THE GOOD THAT HE HAD DONE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN AND HE WAS NOTHING BUT A CONVICT FROM THE GALLEYS
1365-134830-0001 ALL DAY LONG CONVERSATIONS LIKE THE FOLLOWING WERE TO BE HEARD IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE TOWN YOU DON'T KNOW HE WAS A LIBERATED CONVICT WHO THE MAYOR
1365-134830-0002 YES REALLY HIS NAME WAS NOT MADELEINE AT ALL HE HAD A FRIGHTFUL NAME BEJEAN BOJEAN BOUJEAN AH GOOD GOD HE HAS BEEN ARRESTED ARRESTED IN PRISON IN THE CITY PRISON
1365-134830-0003 WHILE WAITING TO BE TRANSFERRED UNTIL HE IS TRANSFERRED HE IS TO BE TRANSFERRED WHERE IS HE TO BE TAKEN HE WILL BE TRIED AT THE ASSIZES FOR A HIGHWAY ROBBERY WHICH HE COMMITTED LONG AGO WELL I SUSPECTED AS MUCH
1365-134830-0004 THAT MAN WAS TOO GOOD TOO PERFECT TOO AFFECTED HE REFUSED THE CROSS HE BESTOWED SOUS ON ALL THE LITTLE SCAMPS HE CAME ACROSS
1365-134830-0005 EVIL HISTORY BACK OF ALL THAT THE DRAWING ROOMS PARTICULARLY ABOUNDED IN REMARKS OF THIS NATURE ONE OLD LADY A SUBSCRIBER TO THE DRAPEAU BLANC
1365-134830-0006 MADE THE FOLLOWING REMARK THE DEPTH OF WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FATHOM I AM NOT SORRY IT WILL BE A LESSON TO THE BONAPARTISTS
1365-134830-0007 ONLY THREE OR FOUR PERSONS IN ALL THE TOWN REMAINED FAITHFUL TO HIS MEMORY THE OLD PORTRESS WHO HAD SERVED HIM WAS AMONG THE NUMBER ON THE EVENING OF THAT DAY THE WORTHY OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING IN HER LODGE
1365-134830-0009 AND THE FLAT CANDLESTICK WHICH HE USED EVERY EVENING TO GO UP TO HIS QUARTERS THEN SHE HUNG THE KEY ON THE NAIL WHENCE HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO TAKE IT AND SET THE CANDLESTICK ON ONE SIDE AS THOUGH SHE WAS EXPECTING HIM THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN ON HER CHAIR
1365-134830-0010 AT THAT MOMENT THE SMALL WINDOW IN THE LODGE OPENED A HAND PASSED THROUGH SEIZED THE KEY AND THE CANDLESTICK AND LIGHTED THE TAPER AT THE CANDLE WHICH WAS BURNING THERE THE PORTRESS RAISED HER EYES
1365-134830-0011 AND STOOD THERE WITH GAPING MOUTH AND A SHRIEK WHICH SHE CONFINED TO HER THROAT SHE KNEW THAT HAND THAT ARM THE SLEEVE OF THAT COAT
1365-134830-0012 IT WAS SEVERAL SECONDS BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK SHE HAD A SEIZURE AS SHE SAID HERSELF WHEN SHE RELATED THE ADVENTURE AFTERWARDS
1365-134830-0013 SHE CRIED AT LAST I THOUGHT YOU WERE SHE STOPPED THE CONCLUSION OF HER SENTENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN LACKING IN RESPECT TOWARDS THE BEGINNING JEAN VALJEAN WAS STILL MONSIEUR LE MAIRE TO HER HE FINISHED HER THOUGHT
1365-134830-0014 IN PRISON SAID HE I WAS THERE I BROKE A BAR OF ONE OF THE WINDOWS I LET MYSELF DROP FROM THE TOP OF A ROOF AND HERE I AM I AM GOING UP TO MY ROOM GO AND FIND SISTER SIMPLICE FOR ME
1365-134830-0015 SHE IS WITH THAT POOR WOMAN NO DOUBT THE OLD WOMAN OBEYED IN ALL HASTE HE GAVE HER NO ORDERS HE WAS QUITE SURE THAT SHE WOULD GUARD HIM BETTER THAN HE SHOULD GUARD HIMSELF
1365-134830-0016 NO ONE EVER FOUND OUT HOW HE HAD MANAGED TO GET INTO THE COURTYARD WITHOUT OPENING THE BIG GATES HE HAD AND ALWAYS CARRIED ABOUT HIM A PASS KEY WHICH OPENED A LITTLE SIDE DOOR BUT HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEARCHED AND HIS LATCH KEY MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM
1365-134830-0017 THIS POINT WAS NEVER EXPLAINED HE ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE LEADING TO HIS CHAMBER ON ARRIVING AT THE TOP HE LEFT HIS CANDLE ON THE TOP STEP OF HIS STAIRS OPENED HIS DOOR WITH VERY LITTLE NOISE WENT AND CLOSED HIS WINDOW AND HIS SHUTTERS BY FEELING
1365-134830-0018 AND THE FORTY SOU PIECE WHICH HAD BEEN BLACKENED BY THE FIRE HE TOOK A SHEET OF PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE THESE ARE THE TWO TIPS OF MY IRON SHOD CUDGEL AND THE FORTY SOU PIECE STOLEN FROM LITTLE GERVAIS
1365-134830-0019 IN THE STRIPS OF LINEN THUS PREPARED HE WRAPPED THE TWO SILVER CANDLESTICKS HE BETRAYED NEITHER HASTE NOR AGITATION AND WHILE HE WAS WRAPPING UP THE BISHOP'S CANDLESTICKS HE NIBBLED AT A PIECE OF BLACK BREAD
1365-134830-0020 COME IN SAID HE IT WAS SISTER SIMPLICE SHE WAS PALE HER EYES WERE RED THE CANDLE WHICH SHE CARRIED TREMBLED IN HER HAND THE PECULIAR FEATURE OF THE VIOLENCES OF DESTINY IS
1365-134830-0021 JEAN VALJEAN HAD JUST FINISHED WRITING A FEW LINES ON A PAPER WHICH HE HANDED TO THE NUN SAYING SISTER
1365-134830-0022 THE PAPER WAS NOT FOLDED SHE CAST A GLANCE UPON IT YOU CAN READ IT SAID HE SHE READ
1365-134830-0023 HE WILL BE SO GOOD AS TO PAY OUT OF IT THE EXPENSES OF MY TRIAL AND OF THE FUNERAL OF THE WOMAN WHO DIED YESTERDAY THE REST IS FOR THE POOR THE SISTER TRIED TO SPEAK BUT SHE ONLY MANAGED
1365-134830-0024 TO STAMMER A FEW INARTICULATE SOUNDS SHE SUCCEEDED IN SAYING HOWEVER DOES NOT MONSIEUR LE MAIRE DESIRE TO TAKE A LAST LOOK AT THAT POOR UNHAPPY WOMAN NO SAID HE
1365-134830-0025 I AM PURSUED IT WOULD ONLY END IN THEIR ARRESTING ME IN THAT ROOM AND THAT WOULD DISTURB HER HE HAD HARDLY FINISHED WHEN A LOUD NOISE BECAME AUDIBLE ON THE STAIRCASE THEY HEARD A TUMULT OF ASCENDING FOOTSTEPS
1365-134830-0026 AND THE OLD PORTRESS SAYING IN HER LOUDEST AND MOST PIERCING TONES MY GOOD SIR
1365-134830-0027 NOR ALL THE EVENING AND THAT I HAVE NOT EVEN LEFT THE DOOR A MAN RESPONDED
1365-134830-0028 THEY RECOGNIZED JAVERT'S VOICE THE CHAMBER WAS SO ARRANGED THAT THE DOOR IN OPENING MASKED THE CORNER OF THE WALL ON THE RIGHT JEAN VALJEAN BLEW OUT THE LIGHT AND PLACED HIMSELF IN THIS ANGLE SISTER SIMPLICE FELL ON HER KNEES NEAR THE TABLE
1365-134830-0029 THE DOOR OPENED JAVERT ENTERED THE WHISPERS OF MANY MEN AND THE PROTESTATIONS OF THE PORTRESS WERE AUDIBLE IN THE CORRIDOR THE NUN DID NOT RAISE HER EYES SHE WAS PRAYING THE CANDLE WAS ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE
1365-134830-0030 JAVERT CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE NUN AND HALTED IN AMAZEMENT IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT IN JAVERT HIS ELEMENT THE VERY AIR HE BREATHED WAS VENERATION FOR ALL AUTHORITY THIS WAS IMPREGNABLE
1365-134830-0031 AND ADMITTED OF NEITHER OBJECTION NOR RESTRICTION IN HIS EYES OF COURSE THE ECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITY WAS THE CHIEF OF ALL HE WAS RELIGIOUS SUPERFICIAL AND CORRECT ON THIS POINT AS ON ALL OTHERS IN HIS EYES A PRIEST WAS A MIND
1365-134830-0032 WHO NEVER MAKES A MISTAKE A NUN WAS A CREATURE WHO NEVER SINS THEY WERE SOULS WALLED IN FROM THIS WORLD WITH A SINGLE DOOR WHICH NEVER OPENED EXCEPT TO ALLOW THE TRUTH TO PASS THROUGH ON PERCEIVING THE SISTER
1365-134830-0033 HIS FIRST MOVEMENT WAS TO RETIRE BUT THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER DUTY WHICH BOUND HIM AND IMPELLED HIM IMPERIOUSLY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION HIS SECOND MOVEMENT WAS TO REMAIN AND TO VENTURE ON AT LEAST ONE QUESTION
1365-134830-0034 THIS WAS SISTER SIMPLICE WHO HAD NEVER TOLD A LIE IN HER LIFE JAVERT KNEW IT AND HELD HER IN SPECIAL VENERATION IN CONSEQUENCE SISTER SAID HE ARE YOU ALONE IN THIS ROOM
1365-134830-0035 A TERRIBLE MOMENT ENSUED DURING WHICH THE POOR PORTRESS FELT AS THOUGH SHE SHOULD FAINT THE SISTER RAISED HER EYES AND ANSWERED YES THEN RESUMED JAVERT YOU WILL EXCUSE ME IF I PERSIST IT IS MY DUTY
1365-134830-0036 YOU HAVE NOT SEEN A CERTAIN PERSON A MAN THIS EVENING HE HAS ESCAPED WE ARE IN SEARCH OF HIM THAT JEAN VALJEAN YOU HAVE NOT SEEN HIM THE SISTER REPLIED NO SHE LIED
1365-134830-0037 O SAINTED MAID YOU LEFT THIS WORLD MANY YEARS AGO YOU HAVE REJOINED YOUR SISTERS THE VIRGINS AND YOUR BROTHERS THE ANGELS IN THE LIGHT MAY THIS LIE BE COUNTED TO YOUR CREDIT IN PARADISE THE SISTER'S AFFIRMATION WAS FOR JAVERT
1365-134830-0038 SO DECISIVE A THING THAT HE DID NOT EVEN OBSERVE THE SINGULARITY OF THAT CANDLE WHICH HAD BUT JUST BEEN EXTINGUISHED AND WHICH WAS STILL SMOKING ON THE TABLE AN HOUR LATER A MAN MARCHING AMID TREES AND MISTS
1365-134830-0039 THAT MAN WAS JEAN VALJEAN IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE TESTIMONY OF TWO OR THREE CARTERS WHO MET HIM THAT HE WAS CARRYING A BUNDLE THAT HE WAS DRESSED IN A BLOUSE WHERE HAD HE OBTAINED THAT BLOUSE NO ONE EVER FOUND OUT
1365-134830-0040 BUT AN AGED WORKMAN HAD DIED IN THE INFIRMARY OF THE FACTORY A FEW DAYS BEFORE LEAVING BEHIND HIM NOTHING BUT HIS BLOUSE PERHAPS THAT WAS THE ONE ONE LAST WORD ABOUT FANTINE WE ALL HAVE A MOTHER
1365-134830-0041 THE EARTH FANTINE WAS GIVEN BACK TO THAT MOTHER
1365-134830-0042 IN RESERVING AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE FROM WHAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD LEFT FOR THE POOR WHO WAS CONCERNED AFTER ALL A CONVICT AND A WOMAN OF THE TOWN THAT IS WHY HE HAD A VERY SIMPLE FUNERAL FOR FANTINE
1365-134830-0043 GOD KNOWS WHERE TO FIND THE SOUL AGAIN FANTINE WAS LAID IN THE SHADE AMONG THE FIRST BONES THAT CAME TO HAND SHE WAS SUBJECTED TO THE PROMISCUOUSNESS OF ASHES SHE WAS THROWN INTO THE PUBLIC GRAVE

1556-139350-0000 CHAPTER NINE THE EVENING OF THE FIFTH OF JUNE WHILE THE MASTER'S HOUSE WAS BEING CONSTRUCTED JOAM GARRAL WAS ALSO BUSIED IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE OUT BUILDINGS COMPRISING THE KITCHEN AND OFFICES IN WHICH PROVISIONS OF ALL KINDS
1556-139350-0001 WERE INTENDED TO BE STORED IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT STOCK OF THE ROOTS OF THAT LITTLE TREE SOME SIX OR TEN FEET IN HEIGHT WHICH YIELDS THE MANIOC
1556-139350-0002 IT IS CERTAIN THAT IN SOUTH AMERICA IT CONTAINS A MORE NOXIOUS JUICE WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO PREVIOUSLY GET RID OF BY PRESSURE WHEN THIS RESULT IS OBTAINED THE ROOT IS REDUCED TO FLOUR
1556-139350-0003 EVEN IN THE FORM OF TAPIOCA ACCORDING TO THE FANCY OF THE NATIVES ON BOARD THE JANGADA THERE WAS A HUGE PILE OF THIS USEFUL PRODUCT DESTINED FOR GENERAL CONSUMPTION AS FOR PRESERVED MEATS NOT FORGETTING A WHOLE FLOCK OF SHEEP
1556-139350-0004 SOME OF EVERY ONE OF THESE THINGS IT WAS HOPED WOULD FIGURE IN TURN ON THE TABLES OF THE MASTER AND HIS MEN AND SO EACH DAY SHOOTING AND FISHING WERE TO BE REGULARLY INDULGED IN FOR BEVERAGES THEY HAD A GOOD STORE OF THE BEST THAT COUNTRY PRODUCED CAYSUMA OR

1556-139350-0008 OR LET US SAY STERN OF THE CRAFT AND FORMED A PART RESERVED FOR THE GARRAL FAMILY AND THEIR PERSONAL SERVANTS IN THE CENTER THE HUTS FOR THE INDIANS AND THE BLACKS HAD BEEN ERECTED
1556-139350-0009 FOR THE INDIANS
1556-139350-0010 WITH ONLY LIGHT POLES SUPPORTING THE ROOF OF FOLIAGE THE AIR CIRCULATED FREELY THROUGHOUT THESE OPEN CONSTRUCTIONS AND SWUNG THE HAMMOCK SUSPENDED IN THE INTERIOR AND THE NATIVES AMONG WHOM WERE THREE OR FOUR COMPLETE FAMILIES WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN
1556-139350-0011 THE INDIANS ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE IN THE OPEN AIR FREE AND UNTRAMMELED WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCUSTOM THEMSELVES TO THE IMPRISONMENT
1556-139350-0012 AND THAT A LARGER NUMBER WERE NOT TAKEN IN CASE OF AN ATTACK BY THE RIVERSIDE INDIANS SUCH WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS THE NATIVES OF CENTRAL AMERICA ARE NOT TO BE FEARED IN THE LEAST AND THE TIMES ARE QUITE CHANGED SINCE IT WAS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE AGAINST THEIR AGGRESSIONS
1556-139350-0013 THE INDIANS ALONG THE RIVER BELONG TO PEACEABLE TRIBES AND THE FIERCEST OF THEM HAVE RETIRED BEFORE THE ADVANCING CIVILIZATION AND DRAWN FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THE RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES
1556-139350-0014 DANGER WAS NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THERE WERE NO PRECAUTIONS AGAINST ATTACKS TO CONCLUDE OUR DESCRIPTION OF THE JANGADA WE HAVE ONLY TO SPEAK OF ONE OR TWO ERECTIONS OF DIFFERENT KINDS WHICH GAVE IT A VERY PICTURESQUE ASPECT
1556-139350-0015 IN THE BOW WAS THE CABIN OF THE PILOT WE SAY IN THE BOW AND NOT AT THE STERN WHERE THE HELMSMAN IS GENERALLY FOUND IN NAVIGATING UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A RUDDER IS OF NO USE LONG OARS HAVE NO EFFECT ON A RAFT OF SUCH DIMENSIONS
1556-139350-0016 EVEN WHEN WORKED WITH A HUNDRED STURDY ARMS IT WAS FROM THE SIDES BY MEANS OF LONG BOATHOOKS OR PROPS THRUST AGAINST THE BED OF THE STREAM THAT THE JANGADA WAS KEPT IN THE CURRENT
1556-139350-0017 WERE CARRIED ON BOARD AND AFFORDED EASY COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BANKS THE PILOT HAD TO LOOK AFTER THE CHANNELS OF THE RIVER THE DEVIATIONS OF THE CURRENT THE EDDIES WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO AVOID THE CREEKS OR BAYS WHICH AFFORDED FAVORABLE ANCHORAGE
1556-139350-0018 WHO HAD BEEN RECEIVED AT THE FAZENDA HE HAD KNOWN THE CHILDREN FROM BIRTH HE HAD BAPTIZED THEM EDUCATED THEM AND HOPED TO GIVE EACH OF THEM THE NUPTIAL BLESSING THE AGE OF THE PADRE DID NOT ALLOW OF HIS EXERCISING HIS IMPORTANT MINISTRY ANY LONGER
1556-139350-0019 BUT IF PADRE PASSANHA DURING THE COURSE OF THE VOYAGE WAS TO TAKE HIS MEALS WITH THE FAMILY
1556-139350-0020 ASSUREDLY THE GOOD OLD PRIEST HAD NEVER BEEN SO LODGED IN HIS MODEST PARSONAGE THE PARSONAGE WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR PADRE PASSANHA HE OUGHT TO HAVE A CHAPEL THE CHAPEL THEN WAS BUILT IN THE CENTER OF THE JANGADA AND A LITTLE BELL SURMOUNTED IT
1556-139350-0021 IT WAS SMALL ENOUGH UNDOUBTEDLY AND IT COULD NOT HOLD THE WHOLE OF THE CREW BUT IT WAS RICHLY DECORATED
1556-139350-0022 SUCH WAS THE WONDERFUL STRUCTURE WHICH WAS GOING DOWN THE AMAZON
1556-139350-0023 FROM THE OBSERVATION AND CALCULATION OF THE RISING IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH THERE WAS NOT MUCH LONGER TO WAIT ALL WAS READY TO DATE THE FIFTH OF JUNE THE PILOT ARRIVED THE EVENING BEFORE HE WAS A MAN ABOUT FIFTY WELL UP IN HIS PROFESSION
1556-139350-0024 BUT RATHER FOND OF DRINK SUCH AS HE WAS
1556-139350-0025 NEVER SAW BETTER THAN WHEN HE HAD IMBIBED A FEW GLASSES OF TAFIA AND HE NEVER DID ANY WORK AT ALL WITHOUT A CERTAIN DEMIJOHN OF THAT LIQUOR TO WHICH HE PAID FREQUENT COURT THE RISE OF THE FLOOD HAD CLEARLY MANIFESTED ITSELF FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1556-139350-0026 IT WOULD ALL HAVE TO BE BUILT OVER AGAIN BUT AS THE FALL OF THE RIVER WOULD BE VERY RAPID IT WOULD TAKE LONG MONTHS BEFORE SIMILAR CONDITIONS RECURRED ON THE FIFTH OF JUNE TOWARD THE EVENING THE FUTURE PASSENGERS OF THE JANGADA WERE COLLECTED ON A PLATEAU
1556-139350-0027 PADRE PASSANHA BENITO LINA FRAGOSO CYBELE AND SOME OF THE SERVANTS INDIAN OR NEGRO OF THE FAZENDA FRAGOSO COULD NOT KEEP HIMSELF STILL HE WENT AND HE CAME HE RAN DOWN THE BANK AND RAN UP THE PLATEAU
1556-139350-0028 HE NOTED THE POINTS OF THE RIVER GAUGE AND SHOUTED HURRAH AS THE WATER CREPT UP IT WILL SWIM IT WILL SWIM HE SHOUTED THE RAFT WHICH IS TO TAKE US TO BELEM IT WILL FLOAT IF ALL THE CATARACTS OF THE SKY HAVE TO OPEN TO FLOOD THE AMAZON
1556-139350-0029 THE JANGADA WAS MOORED TO THE BANK WITH SOLID CABLES SO THAT IT COULD NOT BE CARRIED AWAY BY THE CURRENT WHEN IT FLOATED OFF QUITE A TRIBE FROM ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED INDIANS WITHOUT COUNTING THE POPULATION OF THE VILLAGE
1556-139350-0030 HAD COME TO ASSIST AT THE INTERESTING SPECTACLE THEY WERE ALL KEENLY ON THE WATCH AND SILENCE REIGNED OVER THE IMPRESSIONABLE CROWD
1556-143307-0000 CHAPTER THIRTEEN OVER THE RIVER IT IS OUR INTENTION TO EXPLORE A ROUTE FROM KANAB TO THE COLORADO RIVER AT THE MOUTH OF THE PARIA AND IF SUCCESSFUL IN THIS UNDERTAKING TO CROSS THE RIVER AND PROCEED TO TUSAYAN
1556-143307-0001 AND ULTIMATELY TO SANTA FE NEW MEXICO WE PROPOSE TO BUILD A FLATBOAT FOR THE PURPOSE OF FERRYING OVER THE RIVER AND HAVE HAD THE LUMBER NECESSARY FOR THAT PURPOSE HAULED FROM SAINT GEORGE TO KANAB FROM HERE TO THE MOUTH OF THE PARIA
1556-143307-0002 PUSHING ON TO THE EAST WITH MISTER HAMBLIN FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS IN THE EARLY MORNING WE REACH THE MOUTH OF A DRY CANYON WHICH COMES DOWN THROUGH THE CLIFFS INSTEAD OF A NARROW CANYON WE FIND AN OPEN VALLEY
1556-143307-0003 FROM ONE FOURTH TO ONE HALF A MILE IN WIDTH ON RARE OCCASIONS A STREAM FLOWS DOWN THIS VALLEY BUT NOW SAND DUNES STRETCH ACROSS IT
1556-143307-0004 HERE AGAIN WE FIND THAT WONDERFUL SCENERY OF NAKED WHITE ROCKS CARVED INTO GREAT ROUND BOSSES AND DOMES LOOKING OFF TO THE NORTH WE CAN SEE VERMILION AND PINK CLIFFS CROWNED WITH FORESTS
1556-143307-0005 WHILE BELOW US TO THE SOUTH STRETCH THE DUNES AND RED LANDS OF THE VERMILION CLIFF REGION AND FAR AWAY WE CAN SEE THE OPPOSITE WALL OF THE GRAND CANYON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON WE DESCEND INTO THE CANYON VALLEY AND HURRIEDLY RIDE
1556-143307-0006 AND BY DIGGING INTO THE SAND THIS SWEET WATER IS FOUND
1556-143307-0007 AT SUNRISE MISTER HAMBLIN AND I PART FROM THE TRAIN ONCE MORE TAKING WITH US CHUAR
1556-143307-0008 ALL DAY LONG OUR WAY IS OVER RED HILLS WITH A BOLD LINE OF CLIFFS ON OUR LEFT A LITTLE AFTER NOON WE REACH A GREAT SPRING AND HERE WE ARE TO CAMP FOR THE NIGHT FOR THE REGION BEYOND US IS UNKNOWN AND WE WISH TO ENTER IT WITH A GOOD DAY BEFORE US
1556-143307-0009 AND HAMBLIN AND I CLIMB THE CLIFFS
1556-143307-0010 EARLY IN THE MORNING WE PASS UP A BEAUTIFUL VALLEY TO THE SOUTH AND TURN WESTWARD ONTO A GREAT PROMONTORY FROM THE SUMMIT OF WHICH THE GRAND CANYON IS IN VIEW ITS DEEP GORGE CAN BE SEEN TO THE WESTWARD FOR FIFTY OR SIXTY MILES
1556-143307-0011 AND TO THE SOUTHEASTWARD WE LOOK OFF INTO THE STUPENDOUS CHASM WITH ITS MARVELOUS FORMS AND COLORS TWENTY ONE YEARS LATER I READ OVER THE NOTES OF THAT DAY'S EXPERIENCE AND THE PICTURE OF THE GRAND CANYON FROM THIS POINT IS ONCE MORE BEFORE ME
1556-143307-0012 I DID NOT KNOW WHEN WRITING THE NOTES THAT THIS WAS THE GRANDEST VIEW THAT CAN BE OBTAINED OF THE REGION FROM FREMONT'S PEAK TO THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA BUT I DID REALIZE THAT THE SCENE BEFORE ME WAS AWFUL SUBLIME AND GLORIOUS
1556-143307-0013 AWFUL IN PROFOUND DEPTHS SUBLIME IN MASSIVE AND STRANGE FORMS AND GLORIOUS IN COLORS YEARS LATER I VISITED THE SAME SPOT WITH MY FRIEND THOMAS MORAN FROM THIS WORLD OF WONDER HE SELECTED A SECTION WHICH WAS THE MOST INTERESTING TO HIM
1556-143307-0014 AND PAINTED IT THAT PAINTING KNOWN AS THE CHASM OF THE COLORADO IS IN A HALL IN THE SENATE WING OF THE CAPITOL OF THE UNITED STATES IF ANY ONE WILL LOOK UPON THAT PICTURE AND THEN REALIZE THAT IT WAS BUT A SMALL PART OF THE LANDSCAPE
1556-143307-0015 BEFORE US ON THIS MEMORABLE TWENTY SIXTH DAY OF SEPTEMBER HE WILL UNDERSTAND WHY I SUPPRESS MY NOTES DESCRIPTIVE OF THE SCENE THE LANDSCAPE IS TOO VAST TOO COMPLEX TOO GRAND FOR VERBAL DESCRIPTION
1556-143307-0016 WHO HAVE JOINED US HERE BY PREVIOUS APPOINTMENT AS WE NEED THEIR SERVICES IN CROSSING THE RIVER ON THE LAST DAY OF SEPTEMBER WE FOLLOW THE VERMILION CLIFFS AROUND TO THE MOUTH OF THE PARIA HERE THE CLIFFS PRESENT A WALL OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET IN HEIGHT
1556-143307-0017 ABOVE ORANGE AND VERMILION BUT BELOW CHOCOLATE PURPLE AND GRAY IN ALTERNATING BANDS OF RAINBOW BRIGHTNESS THE CLIFFS ARE CUT WITH DEEP SIDE CANYONS AND THE RAINBOW HILLS BELOW ARE DESTITUTE OF VEGETATION
1556-143307-0018 OR CUTS ITS BOTTOM DEEPER AND STILL DEEPER EVER FORMING NARROW CLEFTS BUT WHEN THE STREAM HAS CUT ITS CHANNEL DOWN UNTIL THE DECLIVITY IS GREATLY REDUCED IT CAN NO LONGER CARRY THE LOAD OF SAND WITH WHICH IT IS FED BUT DROPS A PART OF IT ON THE WAY
1556-143307-0019 WHEREVER IT DROPS IT IN THIS MANNER A SAND BANK IS FORMED NOW THE EFFECT OF THIS SAND BAR IS TO TURN THE COURSE OF THE RIVER AGAINST THE WALL OR BANK AND AS IT UNLOADS IN ONE PLACE IT CUTS IN ANOTHER BELOW AND LOADS ITSELF AGAIN
1556-143307-0020 SO LONG AS THE DECLIVITY OF THE STREAM IS GREAT THE GREATER THE LOAD OF SAND CARRIED THE GREATER THE RATE OF VERTICAL CUTTING BUT WHEN THE DECLIVITY IS REDUCED SO THAT PART OF THE LOAD IS THROWN DOWN VERTICAL CUTTING IS CHANGED TO LATERAL
1556-143307-0021 AND THE DAY IS SPENT IN GETTING TO ITS SUMMIT WE MAKE A DRY CAMP THAT IS WITHOUT WATER EXCEPT THAT WHICH HAS BEEN CARRIED IN CANTEENS BY THE INDIANS OCTOBER FOURTH
1556-143307-0022 ALL DAY LONG WE PASS BY THE FOOT OF THE ECHO CLIFFS WHICH ARE IN FACT THE CONTINUATION OF THE VERMILION CLIFFS
1556-143307-0023 AND DEEP CHASMS RUNNING DOWN INTO THE MARBLE CANYON ON THE RIGHT AT NIGHT WE CAMP AT A WATER POCKET A POOL IN A GREAT LIMESTONE ROCK WE STILL GO SOUTH FOR ANOTHER HALF DAY TO A CEDAR RIDGE HERE WE TURN WESTWARD CLIMBING THE CLIFFS
1556-143307-0024 A GREAT HOMOGENEOUS SANDSTONE STRETCHES DECLINING RAPIDLY AND ON ITS SIDES ARE CARVED INNUMERABLE BASINS WHICH ARE NOW FILLED WITH PURE WATER AND WE CALL THIS THE THOUSAND WELLS
1556-143307-0025 WE HAVE A LONG AFTERNOON'S RIDE OVER SAND DUNES SLOWLY TOILING FROM MILE TO MILE WE CAN SEE A LEDGE OF ROCKS IN THE DISTANCE AND THE INDIAN WITH US ASSURES US THAT WE SHALL FIND WATER THERE
1556-143307-0026 AT NIGHT WE COME TO THE CLIFF AND UNDER IT IN A GREAT CAVE WE FIND A LAKELET SWEETER COOLER WATER NEVER BLESSED THE DESERT WHILE AT JACOB'S POOL SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE I SENT A RUNNER FORWARD INTO THIS REGION WITH INSTRUCTIONS
1556-143307-0027 TO HUNT US UP SOME OF THE NATIVES AND BRING THEM TO THIS POOL WHEN WE ARRIVE WE ARE DISAPPOINTED IN NOT FINDING THEM ON HAND BUT A LITTLE LATER HALF A DOZEN MEN COME IN WITH THE INDIAN MESSENGER THEY ARE SURLY FELLOWS AND SEEM TO BE DISPLEASED AT OUR COMING
1556-143307-0028 ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK I SET A COUPLE OF MEN TO PREPARE A HASTY LUNCH CALL UP ALL HANDS AND WE SADDLE PACK EAT OUR LUNCH AND START OFF TO THE SOUTHWEST TO REACH THE MOENKOPI WHERE THERE IS A LITTLE RANCHERIA OF INDIANS
1556-143307-0029 SO WE ARE TOLD WE SET OUT AT A RAPID RATE AND WHEN DAYLIGHT COMES WE ARE IN SIGHT OF THE CANYON OF THE MOENKOPI INTO WHICH WE SOON DESCEND BUT THE RANCHERIA HAS BEEN ABANDONED
1556-143307-0030 THOUGH I HAVE SEEN MANY RUINS FROM TIME TO TIME AT FIRST I AM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THE PEOPLE THEY SEEM SCARCELY SUPERIOR TO THE SHOSHONES AND UTES TRIBES WITH WHOM I AM SO WELL ACQUAINTED THEIR DRESS IS LESS PICTURESQUE
1556-143307-0031 AND THE MEN HAVE AN UGLY FASHION OF BANGING THEIR HAIR IN FRONT SO THAT IT COMES DOWN TO THEIR EYES AND CONCEALS THEIR FOREHEADS BUT THE WOMEN ARE MORE NEATLY DRESSED AND ARRANGE THEIR HAIR IN PICTURESQUE COILS ORAIBI IS A TOWN OF SEVERAL HUNDRED INHABITANTS
1556-143307-0032 IT STANDS ON A MESA OR LITTLE PLATEAU TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SURROUNDING PLAIN THE MESA ITSELF HAS A RATHER DIVERSIFIED SURFACE THE STREETS OF THE TOWN ARE QUITE IRREGULAR AND IN A GENERAL WAY RUN FROM NORTH TO SOUTH
1556-143307-0033 THE HOUSES ARE CONSTRUCTED TO FACE THE EAST THEY ARE OF STONE LAID IN MORTAR AND ARE USUALLY THREE OR FOUR STORIES HIGH THE SECOND STORY STANDS BACK UPON THE FIRST LEAVING A TERRACE OVER ONE TIER OF ROOMS
1556-143307-0034 THIRD IS SET BACK OF THE SECOND AND THE FOURTH BACK OF THE THIRD SO THAT THEIR HOUSES ARE TERRACED TO FACE THE EAST THESE TERRACES ON THE TOP ARE ALL FLAT AND THE PEOPLE USUALLY ASCEND TO THE FIRST TERRACE BY A LADDER
1556-143307-0035 AND THEN BY ANOTHER INTO THE LOWER ROOMS IN LIKE MANNER LADDERS OR RUDE STAIRWAYS ARE USED TO REACH THE UPPER STORIES THE CLIMATE IS VERY WARM AND THE PEOPLE LIVE ON THE TOPS OF THEIR HOUSES
1556-143307-0036 IT SEEMS STRANGE TO SEE LITTLE NAKED CHILDREN CLIMBING THE LADDERS AND RUNNING OVER THE HOUSE TOPS LIKE HERDS OF MONKEYS AFTER WE HAVE LOOKED ABOUT THE TOWN AND BEEN GAZED UPON BY THE WONDERING EYES OF THE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN
1556-143307-0037 IN A LARGE CENTRAL ROOM WE GATHER AND THE FOOD IS PLACED BEFORE US A STEW OF GOAT'S FLESH IS SERVED IN EARTHEN BOWLS AND EACH ONE OF US IS FURNISHED WITH A LITTLE EARTHEN LADLE THE BREAD IS A GREAT NOVELTY TO ME
1556-143307-0038 IT IS MADE OF CORN MEAL IN SHEETS AS THIN AND LARGE AS FOOLSCAP PAPER IN THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE IS A LITTLE OVEN THE TOP OF WHICH IS A GREAT FLAT STONE AND THE GOOD HOUSEWIFE BAKES HER BREAD IN THIS MANNER
1556-143307-0039 WITH A THIN COATING OF THE MEAL PASTE IN A MINUTE OR TWO IT FORMS INTO A THIN PAPER LIKE CAKE AND SHE TAKES IT UP BY THE EDGE FOLDS IT ONCE AND PLACES IT ON A BASKET TRAY
1556-143307-0040 THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER SHEET OF PAPER BREAD IS MADE IN LIKE MANNER AND PILED ON THE TRAY I NOTICE THAT THE PASTE STANDS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BOWLS AND THAT SHE TAKES FROM ONE BOWL AND THEN ANOTHER IN ORDER
1556-143307-0041 AND I SOON SEE THE EFFECT OF THIS THE CORN BEFORE BEING GROUND IS ASSORTED BY COLORS WHITE YELLOW RED BLUE AND BLACK AND THE SHEETS OF BREAD WHEN MADE ARE OF THE SAME VARIETY OF COLORS WHITE YELLOW RED BLUE AND BLACK
1556-143307-0042 THIS BREAD HELD ON VERY BEAUTIFUL TRAYS IS ITSELF A WORK OF ART THEY CALL IT PIKI AFTER WE HAVE PARTAKEN OF GOAT STEW AND BREAD A COURSE OF DUMPLINGS MELONS AND PEACHES IS SERVED
1556-143307-0043 AND THIS FINISHES THE FEAST WHAT SEEM TO BE DUMPLINGS ARE COMPOSED OF A KIND OF HASH OF BREAD AND MEAT TIED UP IN LITTLE BALLS WITH CORNHUSKS AND SERVED BOILING HOT THEY ARE EATEN WITH MUCH GUSTO BY THE PARTY AND HIGHLY PRAISED
1556-143307-0044 SOME DAYS AFTER WE LEARNED HOW THEY ARE MADE THEY ARE PREPARED OF GOAT'S FLESH BREAD AND TURNIPS AND KNEADED BY MASTICATION AS WE PREFER TO MASTICATE OUR OWN FOOD THIS DAINTY DISH IS NEVER AGAIN A FAVORITE
1556-143307-0045 ONCE MORE THEY SPRINKLE THE SACRED WATER AND THE SACRED MEAL OVER THE TOPS OF THE HOUSES THEN THE CACIQUE IN A LOUD VOICE DIRECTS THE LABOR OF THE DAY SO HIS TALK IS EXPLAINED TO US SOME MUST GATHER CORN OTHERS MUST GO FOR WOOD
1556-143307-0046 WATER MUST BE BROUGHT FROM THE DISTANT WELLS AND THE ANIMALS OF THE STRANGERS MUST BE CARED FOR NOW THE HOUSE TOPS PRESENT A LIVELY SCENE BOWLS OF WATER ARE BROUGHT
1556-143307-0047 FROM THEM THE MEN FILL THEIR MOUTHS AND WITH DEXTERITY BLOW WATER OVER THEIR HANDS IN SPRAY AND WASH THEIR FACES AND LAVE THEIR LONG SHINING HEADS OF HAIR AND THE WOMEN DRESS ONE ANOTHER'S LOCKS WITH BOWLS OF WATER THEY MAKE SUDS OF THE YUCCA PLANT
1556-143307-0048 AND WASH AND COMB AND DEFTLY ROLL THEIR HAIR THE ELDER WOMEN IN GREAT COILS AT THE BACK OF THE HEAD THE YOUNGER WOMEN IN FLAT COILS ON THEIR CHEEKS AND SO THE DAYS ARE PASSED AND THE WEEKS GO BY
1556-143307-0049 AND WE STUDY THE LANGUAGE OF THE PEOPLE AND RECORD MANY HUNDREDS OF THEIR WORDS AND OBSERVE THEIR HABITS AND CUSTOMS AND GAIN SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR MYTHOLOGY BUT ABOVE ALL DO WE BECOME INTERESTED IN THEIR RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES
1556-143307-0050 THE LEADER OF THE SHAMANS IS A GREAT BURLY BALD HEADED INDIAN WHICH IS A REMARKABLE SIGHT FOR I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE WHATEVER HE SAYS OR DOES IS REPEATED BY THREE OTHERS IN TURN THE PARAPHERNALIA
1556-143307-0051 OF THEIR WORSHIP IS VERY INTERESTING AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER IS A SERIES OF TABLETS OF WOOD COVERED WITH QUAINT PICTURES OF ANIMALS AND OF CORN AND OVERHEAD ARE CONVENTIONAL BLACK CLOUDS FROM WHICH YELLOW LIGHTNINGS ARE PROJECTED
1556-143307-0052 WHILE DROPS OF RAIN FALL ON THE CORN BELOW WOODEN BIRDS SET ON PEDESTALS AND DECORATED WITH PLUMES ARE ARRANGED IN VARIOUS WAYS EARS OF CORN VASES OF HOLY WATER
1556-143307-0053 AND TRAYS OF MEAL MAKE UP A PART OF THE PARAPHERNALIA OF WORSHIP I TRY TO RECORD SOME OF THE PRAYERS BUT AM NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO HOLD MY INTERPRETER TO THE WORK BUT ONE OF THESE PRAYERS IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
1556-143307-0054 PASH LOLOMAI MASTER OF THE CLOUDS WE EAT NO STOLEN BREAD OUR YOUNG MEN RIDE NOT THE STOLEN ASS OUR FOOD IS NOT STOLEN FROM THE GARDENS OF OUR NEIGHBORS
1556-143307-0055 WE BESEECH OF THEE TO DIP YOUR GREAT SPRINKLER MADE OF THE FEATHERS OF THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS INTO THE LAKES OF THE SKIES AND SPRINKLE US WITH SWEET RAINS THAT THE GROUND MAY BE PREPARED IN THE WINTER FOR THE CORN THAT GROWS IN THE SUMMER
1556-143307-0056 AT ONE TIME IN THE NIGHT THREE WOMEN WERE BROUGHT INTO THE KIVA THESE WOMEN HAD A CINCTURE OF COTTON ABOUT THEIR LOINS BUT WERE OTHERWISE NUDE ONE WAS VERY OLD ANOTHER OF MIDDLE AGE AND THE THIRD QUITE YOUNG
1556-143307-0057 NECKS SHOULDERS AND BREASTS OF THE WOMEN THEN WITH HIS FINGER AS A BRUSH HE DECORATED THEM OVER THIS GROUNDWORK WHICH WAS OF YELLOW WITH MANY FIGURES IN VARIOUS COLORS FROM THAT TIME TO DAYLIGHT THE THREE WOMEN REMAINED IN THE KIVA
1556-143307-0058 AND TOOK PART IN THE CEREMONY AS CHORISTERS AND DANCING PERFORMERS AT SUNRISE WE ARE FILED OUT OF THE KIVA AND A CURIOUS SIGHT IS PRESENTED TO OUR VIEW SHUPAULOVI IS BUILT IN TERRACES ABOUT A CENTRAL COURT OR PLAZA
1556-143307-0059 AND IN THE PLAZA ABOUT FIFTY MEN ARE DRAWN UP IN A LINE FACING US THESE MEN ARE NAKED EXCEPT THAT THEY WEAR MASKS STRANGE AND GROTESQUE AND GREAT FLARING HEADDRESSES IN MANY COLORS OUR PARTY FROM THE KIVA STAND BEFORE THIS LINE OF MEN
1556-143307-0060 WITH A GREAT CHORUS OF SINGERS SET UP A TUMULTUOUS NOISE AND WITH SLOW SHUFFLING STEPS THE LINE OF MEN AND THE LINE OF WOMEN MOVE TOWARD EACH OTHER IN A CURIOUS WAVING DANCE
1556-143307-0061 WHEN THE LINES APPROACH SO AS TO BE NOT MORE THAN TEN OR TWELVE FEET APART OUR PARTY STILL BEING BETWEEN THEM THEY ALL CHANGE SO AS TO DANCE BACKWARD TO THEIR ORIGINAL POSITIONS
1556-143307-0062 THIS IS REPEATED UNTIL THE DANCERS HAVE PASSED OVER THE PLAZA FOUR TIMES THEN THERE IS A WILD CONFUSION OF DANCES THE ORDER OF WHICH I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IF INDEED THERE IS ANY SYSTEM EXCEPT THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN DANCE APART
1556-143307-0063 SOON THIS IS OVER AND THE WOMEN ALL FILE DOWN THE LADDER INTO THE KIVA AND THE MEN STRIP OFF THEIR MASKS AND ARRANGE THEMSELVES ABOUT THE PLAZA EVERY ONE ACCORDING TO HIS OWN WISH BUT AS IF IN SHARP EXPECTANCY
1556-143307-0064 THEN THE WOMEN RETURN UP THE LADDER FROM THE KIVA AND CLIMB TO THE TOPS OF THE HOUSES AND STAND ON THE BRINK OF THE NEARER TERRACE NOW THE MUSIC COMMENCES ONCE MORE
1556-143307-0065 THROWS SOMETHING I CANNOT TELL WHAT INTO THE MIDST OF THE PLAZA WITH A SHOUT AND A SCREAM EVERY MAN JUMPS FOR IT ONE SEIZES IT ANOTHER TAKES IT AWAY FROM HIM AND THEN ANOTHER SECURES IT
1556-143307-0066 WE EMPLOY OUR TIME IN MAKING A COLLECTION OF THE ARTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS TOWN FIRST WE DISPLAY TO THEM OUR STOCK OF GOODS COMPOSED OF KNIVES NEEDLES AWLS SCISSORS PAINTS DYESTUFFS LEATHER AND VARIOUS FABRICS IN GAY COLORS
1556-143307-0067 THEN WE GO AROUND AMONG THE PEOPLE AND SELECT THE ARTICLES OF POTTERY STONE IMPLEMENTS INSTRUMENTS AND UTENSILS MADE OF BONE HORN SHELL ARTICLES OF CLOTHING AND ORNAMENT BASKETS TRAYS AND MANY OTHER THINGS
1556-143307-0069 AND IT RISES FROM THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SAND PLAINS BELOW BY A PRECIPITOUS CLIFF ON EVERY SIDE TO REACH IT FROM BELOW IT MUST BE CLIMBED BY NICHES AND STAIRWAYS IN THE ROCK IT IS A GOOD SITE FOR DEFENSE
1556-143307-0070 AT THE FOOT OF THE CLIFF AND ON SOME TERRACES THE PEOPLE HAVE BUILT CORRALS OF STONE FOR THEIR ASSES ALL THE WATER USED IN THESE THREE TOWNS IS DERIVED FROM A WELL NEARLY A MILE AWAY A DEEP PIT SUNK IN THE SAND OVER THE SITE OF A DUNE
1556-143307-0071 AND AFTER THEY ARE FED THEY ARE SENT AWAY TO A DISTANCE OF SOME MILES THERE IS NO TREE OR SHRUB GROWING NEAR THE WALPI MESA IT IS MILES AWAY TO WHERE THE STUNTED CEDARS ARE FOUND AND THE PEOPLE BRING CURIOUS LITTLE LOADS OF WOOD ON THE BACKS OF THEIR DONKEYS
1556-143307-0072 HANO OR TEWA AS IT IS SOMETIMES CALLED HAS BEEN BUILT LATELY
1556-143307-0073 THE OTHER TOWNS ARE VERY OLD THEIR FOUNDATION DATES BACK MANY CENTURIES SO WE GATHER FROM THIS TALK THE PEOPLE OF HANO ALSO SPEAK A RADICALLY DISTINCT LANGUAGE BELONGING TO ANOTHER STOCK OF TRIBES THEY FORMERLY LIVED ON THE RIO GRANDE
1556-143307-0074 BUT DURING SOME WAR THEY WERE DRIVEN AWAY AND WERE PERMITTED TO BUILD THEIR HOME HERE TWO DAYS ARE SPENT IN TRADING WITH THE PEOPLE AND WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON HAVING MADE A GOOD ETHNOLOGIC COLLECTION WE ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN SEEING THE MEN AND WOMEN SPIN AND WEAVE
1556-143307-0075 OR MEDICINE ORDERS AS THEY ARE SOMETIMES CALLED BUT THIS INSTITUTION HAS BEEN NOWHERE DEVELOPED MORE THOROUGHLY THAN AMONG THE PUEBLO INDIANS OF THIS REGION
1556-143307-0076 THAT A PART OF THEIR CEREMONIES ARE SECRET AND ANOTHER PART PUBLIC AND THAT THE TIMES OF CEREMONY ARE ALSO TIMES FOR FEASTING AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HERE AT WALPI THE GREAT SNAKE DANCE IS PERFORMED FOR SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE THIS FESTIVAL IS HELD
1556-143307-0077 THE PEOPLE WITH GREAT DILIGENCE GATHER SNAKES FROM THE ROCKS AND SANDS OF THE REGION ROUND ABOUT AND BRING THEM TO THE KIVA OF ONE OF THEIR CLANS IN GREAT NUMBERS BY SCORES AND HUNDREDS MOST OF THESE SNAKES ARE QUITE HARMLESS BUT RATTLESNAKES ABOUND
1556-143307-0078 AND THEY ARE ALSO CAUGHT FOR THEY PLAY THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE GREAT SNAKE DANCE THE MEDICINE MEN OR PRIEST DOCTORS ARE VERY DEFT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF RATTLESNAKES WHEN THEY BRING THEM TO THE KIVA
1556-143307-0079 THEY HERD ALL THE SNAKES IN A GREAT MASS OF WRITHING HISSING RATTLING SERPENTS FOR THIS PURPOSE THEY HAVE LITTLE WANDS TO THE END OF EACH ONE OF WHICH A BUNCH OF FEATHERS IS AFFIXED IF A SNAKE ATTEMPTS TO LEAVE ITS ALLOTTED PLACE IN THE KIVA
1556-143307-0080 THE MEN OF THE ORDER PREPARE FOR THE GREAT PERFORMANCE WITH THE SNAKES CLOTHED ONLY IN LOINCLOTH EACH ONE SEIZES A SNAKE AND A RATTLESNAKE IS PREFERRED IF THERE ARE ENOUGH OF THEM FOR ALL IT IS MANAGED IN THIS WAY
1556-143307-0081 THE SNAKE IS TEASED WITH THE FEATHER WAND AND HIS ATTENTION OCCUPIED BY ONE MAN WHILE ANOTHER STANDING NEAR AT A FAVORABLE MOMENT SEIZES THE SNAKE JUST BACK OF THE HEAD THEN HE PUTS THE SNAKE IN HIS MOUTH
1556-143307-0082 BUT THE ATTENTION OF THE SNAKE IS CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED BY THE ATTENDANT WHO CARRIES THE WAND THEN THE MEN OF THE PRIEST ORDER CARRYING THE SNAKES IN THEIR MOUTHS ARRANGE THEMSELVES IN A LINE IN THE COURT AND MOVE IN A PROCESSION SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT THE COURT AND THEN ENGAGE IN A DANCE
1571-138486-0000 THE TWO BILLS HAD A COMMON ORIGIN AND TO A GREAT EXTENT A COMMON OBJECT THEY WERE FRAMED AT THE SAME TIME AND LAID ASIDE AT THE SAME TIME THEY SANK TOGETHER INTO OBLIVION
1571-138486-0001 ADAPTED TO THE WANTS THE FEELINGS AND THE PREJUDICES OF THE EXISTING GENERATION ACCORDINGLY WHILE THE TOLERATION BILL FOUND SUPPORT IN ALL QUARTERS THE COMPREHENSION BILL WAS ATTACKED FROM ALL QUARTERS
1571-138486-0002 AND WAS AT LAST COLDLY AND LANGUIDLY DEFENDED EVEN BY THOSE WHO HAD INTRODUCED IT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AT WHICH THE TOLERATION BILL BECAME LAW WITH THE GENERAL CONCURRENCE OF PUBLIC MEN THE COMPREHENSION BILL WAS
1571-138486-0003 WITH A CONCURRENCE NOT LESS GENERAL SUFFERED TO DROP THE TOLERATION BILL STILL RANKS AMONG THOSE GREAT STATUTES WHICH ARE EPOCHS IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY THE COMPREHENSION BILL IS FORGOTTEN
1571-138486-0004 NO COLLECTOR OF ANTIQUITIES HAS THOUGHT IT WORTH PRESERVING A SINGLE COPY THE SAME WHICH NOTTINGHAM PRESENTED TO THE PEERS IS STILL AMONG OUR PARLIAMENTARY RECORDS BUT HAS BEEN SEEN BY ONLY TWO OR THREE PERSONS NOW LIVING
1571-138486-0005 IT IS A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN THIS COPY ALMOST THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE BILL CAN BE READ IN SPITE OF CANCELLATIONS AND INTERLINEATIONS
1571-138486-0006 DISPENSED ALL THE MINISTERS OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH FROM THE NECESSITY OF SUBSCRIBING THE THIRTY NINE ARTICLES FOR THE ARTICLES WAS SUBSTITUTED A DECLARATION WHICH RAN THUS
1571-138486-0007 I DO APPROVE OF THE DOCTRINE AND WORSHIP AND GOVERNMENT OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND BY LAW ESTABLISHED AS CONTAINING ALL THINGS NECESSARY TO SALVATION AND I PROMISE IN THE EXERCISE OF MY MINISTRY TO PREACH AND PRACTICE ACCORDING THEREUNTO
1571-138486-0008 ANOTHER CLAUSE GRANTED SIMILAR INDULGENCE TO THE MEMBERS OF THE TWO UNIVERSITIES THEN IT WAS PROVIDED THAT ANY MINISTER WHO HAD BEEN ORDAINED AFTER THE PRESBYTERIAN FASHION MIGHT WITHOUT REORDINATION
1571-138486-0009 AND ADMINISTER THE SACRAMENTS AND TO PERFORM ALL OTHER MINISTERIAL OFFICES IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND THE PERSON THUS ADMITTED WAS TO BE CAPABLE OF HOLDING ANY RECTORY OR VICARAGE IN THE KINGDOM
1571-138486-0010 THEN FOLLOWED CLAUSES PROVIDING THAT A CLERGYMAN MIGHT EXCEPT IN A FEW CHURCHES OF PECULIAR DIGNITY WEAR THE SURPLICE OR NOT AS HE THOUGHT FIT THAT THE SIGN OF THE CROSS MIGHT BE OMITTED IN BAPTISM THAT CHILDREN MIGHT BE CHRISTENED
1571-138486-0011 IF SUCH WERE THE WISH OF THEIR PARENTS WITHOUT GODFATHERS OR GODMOTHERS AND THAT PERSONS WHO HAD A SCRUPLE ABOUT RECEIVING THE EUCHARIST KNEELING MIGHT RECEIVE IT SITTING THE CONCLUDING CLAUSE WAS DRAWN IN THE FORM OF A PETITION
1571-138486-0012 AND TO RECOMMEND SUCH ALTERATIONS AS MIGHT ON INQUIRY APPEAR TO BE DESIRABLE THE BILL WENT SMOOTHLY THROUGH THE FIRST STAGES COMPTON WHO SINCE SANCROFT HAD SHUT HIMSELF UP AT LAMBETH WAS VIRTUALLY PRIMATE
1571-138486-0013 IT APPEARED THAT THERE WAS A STRONG BODY OF CHURCHMEN WHO WERE DETERMINED NOT TO GIVE UP A SINGLE WORD OR FORM TO WHOM IT SEEMED THAT THE PRAYERS WERE NO PRAYERS WITHOUT THE SURPLICE THE BABE NO CHRISTIAN IF NOT MARKED WITH THE CROSS
1571-138486-0014 THE BREAD AND WINE NO MEMORIALS OF REDEMPTION OR VEHICLES OF GRACE IF NOT RECEIVED ON BENDED KNEE WHY THESE PERSONS ASKED WAS THE DOCILE AND AFFECTIONATE SON OF THE CHURCH TO BE DISGUSTED BY SEEING THE IRREVERENT PRACTICES OF A CONVENTICLE
1571-138486-0015 INTRODUCED INTO HER MAJESTIC CHOIRS WHY SHOULD HIS FEELINGS HIS PREJUDICES IF PREJUDICES THEY WERE BE LESS CONSIDERED THAN THE WHIMS OF SCHISMATICS IF AS BURNET AND MEN LIKE BURNET WERE NEVER WEARY OF REPEATING
1571-138486-0016 INDULGENCE WAS DUE TO A WEAK BROTHER WAS IT LESS DUE TO THE BROTHER WHOSE WEAKNESS CONSISTED IN THE EXCESS OF HIS LOVE FOR AN ANCIENT A DECENT A BEAUTIFUL RITUAL ASSOCIATED IN HIS IMAGINATION FROM CHILDHOOD WITH ALL THAT IS MOST SUBLIME AND ENDEARING
1571-138486-0017 WAS NOT THAT SORT OF SCRUPULOSITY WHICH THE APOSTLE HAD COMMANDED BELIEVERS TO RESPECT IT SPRANG NOT FROM MORBID TENDERNESS OF CONSCIENCE BUT FROM CENSORIOUSNESS AND SPIRITUAL PRIDE
1571-138486-0018 AND NONE WHO HAD STUDIED THE NEW TESTAMENT COULD HAVE FAILED TO OBSERVE THAT WHILE WE ARE CHARGED CAREFULLY TO AVOID WHATEVER MAY GIVE SCANDAL TO THE FEEBLE WE ARE TAUGHT BY DIVINE PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE TO MAKE NO CONCESSION TO THE SUPERCILIOUS
1571-138486-0019 PAINTED GLASS MUSIC HOLIDAYS FAST DAYS WERE NOT OF THE ESSENCE OF RELIGION WERE THE WINDOWS OF KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL TO BE BROKEN AT THE DEMAND OF ONE SET OF FANATICS WAS THE ORGAN OF EXETER TO BE SILENCED TO PLEASE ANOTHER
1571-138486-0020 WAS CHRISTMAS NO LONGER TO BE A DAY OF REJOICING WAS PASSION WEEK NO LONGER TO BE A SEASON OF HUMILIATION THESE CHANGES IT IS TRUE WERE NOT YET PROPOSED PUT IF SO THE HIGH CHURCHMEN REASONED
1571-138486-0021 ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH THE PURITANS REGARD AS THE BLEMISHES OF THE CHURCH ARE BY A LARGE PART OF THE POPULATION RECKONED AMONG HER ATTRACTIONS MAY SHE NOT IN CEASING TO GIVE SCANDAL TO A FEW SOUR PRECISIANS
1571-138486-0022 CEASE ALSO TO INFLUENCE THE HEARTS OF MANY WHO NOW DELIGHT IN HER ORDINANCES IS IT NOT TO BE APPREHENDED THAT FOR EVERY PROSELYTE WHOM SHE ALLURES FROM THE MEETING HOUSE TEN OF HER OLD DISCIPLES MAY TURN AWAY FROM HER MAIMED RITES AND DISMANTLED TEMPLES
1571-138486-0023 AND THAT THESE NEW SEPARATISTS MAY EITHER FORM THEMSELVES INTO A SECT FAR MORE FORMIDABLE THAN THE SECT WHICH WE ARE NOW SEEKING TO CONCILIATE OR MAY IN THE VIOLENCE OF THEIR DISGUST AT A COLD AND IGNOBLE WORSHIP
1571-138486-0024 THE TRUTH IS THAT FROM THE TIME OF JAMES THE FIRST THAT GREAT PARTY WHICH HAS BEEN PECULIARLY ZEALOUS FOR THE ANGLICAN POLITY AND THE ANGLICAN RITUAL HAS ALWAYS LEANED STRONGLY TOWARDS ARMINIANISM
1571-138486-0025 HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT HER DELIBERATE JUDGMENT ON SUCH POINTS IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE FOUND IN AN ARTICLE OR A HOMILY THAN IN AN EJACULATION OF PENITENCE OR A HYMN OF THANKSGIVING IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT IN THE DEBATES ON THE COMPREHENSION BILL
1571-138486-0026 A SINGLE HIGH CHURCHMAN RAISED HIS VOICE AGAINST THE CLAUSE WHICH RELIEVED THE CLERGY FROM THE NECESSITY OF SUBSCRIBING THE ARTICLES AND OF DECLARING THE DOCTRINE CONTAINED IN THE HOMILIES TO BE SOUND NAY THE DECLARATION WHICH IN THE ORIGINAL DRAUGHT
1571-138486-0027 HAD THE BILL BECOME LAW THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE KINGDOM WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE NECESSITY OF SIGNING THE ARTICLES
1571-138486-0028 PRESENTS A STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE SPIRIT WITH WHICH THEY STRUGGLED FOR HER POLITY AND HER RITUAL THE CLAUSE WHICH ADMITTED PRESBYTERIAN MINISTERS TO HOLD BENEFICES WITHOUT EPISCOPAL ORDINATION WAS REJECTED
1571-138486-0029 THE MAJORITY OF PEERS IN THE HOUSE WAS AGAINST THE PROPOSED INDULGENCE AND THE SCALE WAS BUT JUST TURNED BY THE PROXIES BUT BY THIS TIME IT BEGAN TO APPEAR THAT THE BILL WHICH THE HIGH CHURCHMEN WERE SO KEENLY ASSAILING
1571-138486-0030 THE TRUTH IS THAT THE TIME FOR SUCH A SCHEME HAD GONE BY IF A HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER WHEN THE DIVISION IN THE PROTESTANT BODY WAS RECENT
1571-138486-0031 ELIZABETH HAD BEEN SO WISE AS TO ABSTAIN FROM REQUIRING THE OBSERVANCE OF A FEW FORMS WHICH A LARGE PART OF HER SUBJECTS CONSIDERED AS POPISH SHE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE AVERTED THOSE FEARFUL CALAMITIES WHICH FORTY YEARS AFTER HER DEATH AFFLICTED THE CHURCH
1571-138486-0032 BUT THE GENERAL TENDENCY OF SCHISM IS TO WIDEN HAD LEO THE TENTH WHEN THE EXACTIONS AND IMPOSTURES OF THE PARDONERS FIRST ROUSED THE INDIGNATION OF SAXONY CORRECTED THOSE EVIL PRACTICES WITH A VIGOROUS HAND
1571-138486-0033 THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT OF QUARREL WAS ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE INQUIRING SPIRIT WHICH HAD BEEN ROUSED BY A SINGLE ABUSE HAD DISCOVERED OR IMAGINED A THOUSAND CONTROVERSIES ENGENDERED CONTROVERSIES
1571-138486-0034 EVERY ATTEMPT THAT WAS MADE TO ACCOMMODATE ONE DISPUTE ENDED BY PRODUCING ANOTHER AND AT LENGTH A GENERAL COUNCIL WHICH DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE DISTEMPER HAD BEEN SUPPOSED TO BE AN INFALLIBLE REMEDY MADE THE CASE UTTERLY HOPELESS
1571-138486-0035 IN THIS RESPECT AS IN MANY OTHERS THE HISTORY OF PURITANISM IN ENGLAND BEARS A CLOSE ANALOGY TO THE HISTORY OF PROTESTANTISM IN EUROPE THE PARLIAMENT OF SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE COULD NO MORE PUT AN END TO NONCONFORMITY BY TOLERATING A GARB OR A POSTURE
1571-138486-0036 THAN THE DOCTORS OF TRENT COULD HAVE RECONCILED THE TEUTONIC NATIONS TO THE PAPACY BY REGULATING THE SALE OF INDULGENCES IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY QUAKERISM WAS UNKNOWN AND THERE WAS NOT IN THE WHOLE REALM A SINGLE CONGREGATION OF INDEPENDENTS OR BAPTISTS
1571-138486-0037 AT THE TIME OF THE REVOLUTION THE INDEPENDENTS BAPTISTS AND QUAKERS WERE A MAJORITY OF THE DISSENTING BODY AND THESE SECTS COULD NOT BE GAINED OVER ON ANY TERMS WHICH THE LOWEST OF LOW CHURCHMEN WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO OFFER
1571-138486-0038 THE INDEPENDENT HELD THAT A NATIONAL CHURCH GOVERNED BY ANY CENTRAL AUTHORITY WHATEVER POPE PATRIARCH KING BISHOP OR SYNOD WAS AN UNSCRIPTURAL INSTITUTION AND THAT EVERY CONGREGATION OF BELIEVERS WAS UNDER CHRIST
1571-138486-0039 WOULD NOT NOW SATISFY EVEN ONE HALF OF THE NONCONFORMISTS AND IT WAS THE OBVIOUS INTEREST OF EVERY NONCONFORMIST WHOM NO CONCESSION WOULD SATISFY THAT NONE OF HIS BRETHREN SHOULD BE SATISFIED THE MORE LIBERAL THE TERMS OF COMPREHENSION
1571-138486-0040 THE GREATER WAS THE ALARM OF EVERY SEPARATIST WHO KNEW THAT HE COULD IN NO CASE BE COMPREHENDED THERE WAS BUT SLENDER HOPE THAT THE DISSENTERS UNBROKEN AND ACTING AS ONE MAN WOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THE LEGISLATURE
1571-138486-0041 FULL ADMISSION TO CIVIL PRIVILEGES AND ALL HOPE OF OBTAINING SUCH ADMISSION MUST BE RELINQUISHED IF NOTTINGHAM SHOULD BY THE HELP OF SOME WELLMEANING BUT SHORTSIGHTED FRIENDS OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY BE ENABLED TO ACCOMPLISH HIS DESIGN IF HIS BILL PASSED
1571-138486-0042 AND THE CHURCH STRENGTHENED BY A LARGE REINFORCEMENT IT WAS PLAIN THAT ALL CHANCE OF OBTAINING ANY RELAXATION OF THE TEST ACT WOULD BE AT AN END AND IT WAS BUT TOO PROBABLE THAT THE TOLERATION ACT MIGHT NOT LONG REMAIN UNREPEALED
1571-138486-0043 SINCE THE DECLARATION OF INDULGENCE HAD APPEARED BEEN VERY AGREEABLY SETTLED IN THE CAPITAL AND IN OTHER LARGE TOWNS AND WERE NOW ABOUT TO ENJOY UNDER THE SURE GUARANTEE OF AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT THAT TOLERATION WHICH
1571-138486-0044 UNDER THE DECLARATION OF INDULGENCE HAD BEEN ILLICIT AND PRECARIOUS THE SITUATION OF THESE MEN WAS SUCH AS THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE DIVINES OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH MIGHT WELL ENVY FEW INDEED OF THE PAROCHIAL CLERGY WERE SO ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED WITH COMFORTS
1571-138486-0046 WARDENS OF THE COMPANY OF FISHMONGERS AND WARDENS OF THE COMPANY OF GOLDSMITHS ENABLED HIM TO BECOME A LANDOWNER OR A MORTGAGEE THE BEST BROADCLOTH FROM BLACKWELL HALL AND THE BEST POULTRY FROM LEADENHALL MARKET WERE FREQUENTLY LEFT AT HIS DOOR
1571-138486-0047 HIS INFLUENCE OVER HIS FLOCK WAS IMMENSE SCARCELY ANY MEMBER OF A CONGREGATION OF SEPARATISTS ENTERED INTO A PARTNERSHIP MARRIED A DAUGHTER PUT A SON OUT AS APPRENTICE OR GAVE HIS VOTE AT AN ELECTION WITHOUT CONSULTING HIS SPIRITUAL GUIDE
1571-138486-0048 ON ALL POLITICAL AND LITERARY QUESTIONS THE MINISTER WAS THE ORACLE OF HIS OWN CIRCLE IT WAS POPULARLY REMARKED DURING MANY YEARS THAT AN EMINENT DISSENTING MINISTER HAD ONLY TO MAKE HIS SON AN ATTORNEY OR A PHYSICIAN
1571-138486-0049 THAT THE ATTORNEY WAS SURE TO HAVE CLIENTS AND THE PHYSICIAN TO HAVE PATIENTS WHILE A WAITING WOMAN WAS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AS A HELP MEET FOR A CHAPLAIN IN HOLY ORDERS OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH THE WIDOWS AND DAUGHTERS OF OPULENT CITIZENS WERE SUPPOSED TO BELONG IN A PECULIAR MANNER
1571-138486-0050 TO NONCONFORMIST PASTORS ONE OF THE GREAT PRESBYTERIAN RABBIES THEREFORE MIGHT WELL DOUBT WHETHER IN A WORLDLY VIEW HE SHOULD BE BENEFITED BY A COMPREHENSION HE MIGHT INDEED HOLD A RECTORY OR A VICARAGE WHEN HE COULD GET ONE
1571-138486-0051 BUT IN THE MEANTIME HE WOULD BE DESTITUTE HIS MEETING HOUSE WOULD BE CLOSED HIS CONGREGATION WOULD BE DISPERSED AMONG THE PARISH CHURCHES IF A BENEFICE WERE BESTOWED ON HIM IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A VERY SLENDER COMPENSATION FOR THE INCOME WHICH HE HAD LOST
1571-138486-0052 ONE SECTION OF THAT PARTY WAS FOR RELIEVING THE DISSENTERS FROM THE TEST ACT AND GIVING UP THE COMPREHENSION BILL ANOTHER SECTION WAS FOR PUSHING FORWARD THE COMPREHENSION BILL AND POSTPONING TO A MORE CONVENIENT TIME THE CONSIDERATION OF THE TEST ACT
1571-138486-0053 THE EFFECT OF THIS DIVISION AMONG THE FRIENDS OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY WAS THAT THE HIGH CHURCHMEN THOUGH A MINORITY IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND NOT A MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS WERE ABLE TO OPPOSE WITH SUCCESS BOTH THE REFORMS WHICH THEY DREADED
1571-141320-0000 A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS BARTLEBY CONCLUDED FOUR LENGTHY DOCUMENTS BEING QUADRUPLICATES OF A WEEK'S TESTIMONY TAKEN BEFORE ME IN MY HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY IT BECAME NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THEM
1571-141320-0001 ACCORDINGLY TURKEY NIPPERS AND GINGER NUT HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS IN A ROW EACH WITH HIS DOCUMENT IN HAND WHEN I CALLED TO BARTLEBY TO JOIN THIS INTERESTING GROUP BARTLEBY
1571-141320-0002 I HEARD A SLOW SCRAPE OF HIS CHAIR LEGS ON THE UNCARPETED FLOOR AND SOON HE APPEARED STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE OF HIS HERMITAGE WHAT IS WANTED
1571-141320-0003 THE COPIES THE COPIES SAID I HURRIEDLY WE ARE GOING TO EXAMINE THEM THERE AND I HELD TOWARDS HIM THE FOURTH QUADRUPLICATE I WOULD PREFER NOT TO HE SAID AND GENTLY DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE SCREEN
1571-141320-0004 BUT IN A WONDERFUL MANNER TOUCHED AND DISCONCERTED ME I BEGAN TO REASON WITH HIM THESE ARE YOUR OWN COPIES WE ARE ABOUT TO EXAMINE IT IS LABOR SAVING TO YOU BECAUSE ONE EXAMINATION WILL ANSWER FOR YOUR FOUR PAPERS IT IS COMMON USAGE
1571-141320-0005 EVERY COPYIST IS BOUND TO HELP EXAMINE HIS COPY IS IT NOT SO WILL YOU NOT SPEAK ANSWER I PREFER NOT TO HE REPLIED IN A FLUTE LIKE TONE
1571-141320-0006 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT WHILE I HAD BEEN ADDRESSING HIM HE CAREFULLY REVOLVED EVERY STATEMENT THAT I MADE FULLY COMPREHENDED THE MEANING COULD NOT GAINSAY THE IRRESISTIBLE CONCLUSIONS BUT AT THE SAME TIME SOME PARAMOUNT CONSIDERATION PREVAILED WITH HIM TO REPLY AS HE DID
1571-141320-0007 YOU ARE DECIDED THEN NOT TO COMPLY WITH MY REQUEST A REQUEST MADE ACCORDING TO COMMON USAGE AND COMMON SENSE HE BRIEFLY GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT ON THAT POINT MY JUDGMENT WAS SOUND YES HIS DECISION WAS IRREVERSIBLE
1571-141320-0008 IT IS NOT SELDOM THE CASE THAT WHEN A MAN IS BROWBEATEN IN SOME UNPRECEDENTED AND VIOLENTLY UNREASONABLE WAY HE BEGINS TO STAGGER IN HIS OWN PLAINEST FAITH HE BEGINS AS IT WERE VAGUELY TO SURMISE THAT
1571-141320-0009 WONDERFUL AS IT MAY BE ALL THE JUSTICE AND ALL THE REASON IS ON THE OTHER SIDE ACCORDINGLY IF ANY DISINTERESTED PERSONS ARE PRESENT HE TURNS TO THEM FOR SOME REINFORCEMENT FOR HIS OWN FALTERING MIND TURKEY SAID I
1571-141320-0010 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS AM I NOT RIGHT WITH SUBMISSION SIR SAID TURKEY WITH HIS BLANDEST TONE I THINK THAT YOU ARE NIPPERS SAID I WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT I THINK I SHOULD KICK HIM OUT OF THE OFFICE
1571-141320-0011 THE READER OF NICE PERCEPTIONS WILL HERE PERCEIVE THAT IT BEING MORNING TURKEY'S ANSWER IS COUCHED IN POLITE AND TRANQUIL TERMS BUT NIPPERS REPLIES IN ILL TEMPERED ONES OR TO REPEAT A PREVIOUS SENTENCE
1571-141320-0012 NIPPERS UGLY MOOD WAS ON DUTY AND TURKEY'S OFF GINGER NUT SAID I WILLING TO ENLIST THE SMALLEST SUFFRAGE IN MY BEHALF WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT I THINK SIR HE'S A LITTLE LUNY REPLIED GINGER NUT WITH A GRIN
1571-141320-0013 YOU HEAR WHAT THEY SAY SAID I TURNING TOWARDS THE SCREEN COME FORTH AND DO YOUR DUTY BUT HE VOUCHSAFED NO REPLY I PONDERED A MOMENT IN SORE PERPLEXITY BUT ONCE MORE BUSINESS HURRIED ME
1571-141320-0014 WITH A LITTLE TROUBLE WE MADE OUT TO EXAMINE THE PAPERS WITHOUT BARTLEBY THOUGH AT EVERY PAGE OR TWO TURKEY DEFERENTIALLY DROPPED HIS OPINION THAT THIS PROCEEDING WAS QUITE OUT OF THE COMMON WHILE NIPPERS TWITCHING IN HIS CHAIR WITH A DYSPEPTIC NERVOUSNESS
1571-141320-0015 GROUND OUT BETWEEN HIS SET TEETH OCCASIONAL HISSING MALEDICTIONS AGAINST THE STUBBORN OAF BEHIND THE SCREEN AND FOR HIS NIPPERS PART THIS WAS THE FIRST AND THE LAST TIME HE WOULD DO ANOTHER MAN'S BUSINESS WITHOUT PAY
1571-141320-0016 MEANWHILE BARTLEBY SAT IN HIS HERMITAGE OBLIVIOUS TO EVERY THING BUT HIS OWN PECULIAR BUSINESS THERE SOME DAYS PASSED THE SCRIVENER BEING EMPLOYED UPON ANOTHER LENGTHY WORK HIS LATE REMARKABLE CONDUCT LED ME TO REGARD HIS WAYS NARROWLY
1571-141320-0017 I OBSERVED THAT HE NEVER WENT TO DINNER INDEED THAT HE NEVER WENT ANY WHERE AS YET I HAD NEVER OF MY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE KNOWN HIM TO BE OUTSIDE OF MY OFFICE HE WAS A PERPETUAL SENTRY IN THE CORNER
1571-141320-0018 AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THOUGH IN THE MORNING I NOTICED THAT GINGER NUT WOULD ADVANCE TOWARD THE OPENING IN BARTLEBY'S SCREEN AS IF SILENTLY BECKONED THITHER BY A GESTURE INVISIBLE TO ME WHERE I SAT
1571-141320-0019 HE MUST BE A VEGETARIAN THEN BUT NO HE NEVER EATS EVEN VEGETABLES HE EATS NOTHING BUT GINGER NUTS MY MIND THEN RAN ON IN REVERIES CONCERNING THE PROBABLE EFFECTS UPON THE HUMAN CONSTITUTION OF LIVING ENTIRELY ON GINGER NUTS
1571-141320-0020 IT IS PLAIN HE INTENDS NO INSOLENCE HIS ASPECT SUFFICIENTLY EVINCES THAT HIS ECCENTRICITIES ARE INVOLUNTARY HE IS USEFUL TO ME I CAN GET ALONG WITH HIM IF I TURN HIM AWAY THE CHANCES ARE HE WILL FALL IN WITH SOME LESS INDULGENT EMPLOYER
1571-141320-0021 AND THEN HE WILL BE RUDELY TREATED AND PERHAPS DRIVEN FORTH MISERABLY TO STARVE YES HERE I CAN CHEAPLY PURCHASE A DELICIOUS SELF APPROVAL TO BEFRIEND BARTLEBY TO HUMOR HIM IN HIS STRANGE WILLFULNESS WILL COST ME LITTLE OR NOTHING
1571-141320-0022 WHILE I LAY UP IN MY SOUL WHAT WILL EVENTUALLY PROVE A SWEET MORSEL FOR MY CONSCIENCE BUT THIS MOOD WAS NOT INVARIABLE WITH ME THE PASSIVENESS OF BARTLEBY SOMETIMES IRRITATED ME I FELT STRANGELY GOADED ON TO ENCOUNTER HIM IN NEW OPPOSITION
1571-141320-0023 BARTLEBY SAID I WHEN THOSE PAPERS ARE ALL COPIED I WILL COMPARE THEM WITH YOU I WOULD PREFER NOT TO HOW
1571-141320-0024 HE SAYS A SECOND TIME HE WON'T EXAMINE HIS PAPERS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT TURKEY IT WAS AFTERNOON BE IT REMEMBERED TURKEY SAT GLOWING LIKE A BRASS BOILER HIS BALD HEAD STEAMING HIS HANDS REELING AMONG HIS BLOTTED PAPERS THINK OF IT
1571-141320-0025 ROARED TURKEY I THINK I'LL JUST STEP BEHIND HIS SCREEN AND BLACK HIS EYES FOR HIM SO SAYING TURKEY ROSE TO HIS FEET AND THREW HIS ARMS INTO A PUGILISTIC POSITION HE WAS HURRYING AWAY TO MAKE GOOD HIS PROMISE WHEN I DETAINED HIM
1571-141320-0026 ALARMED AT THE EFFECT OF INCAUTIOUSLY ROUSING TURKEY'S COMBATIVENESS AFTER DINNER SIT DOWN TURKEY SAID I AND HEAR WHAT NIPPERS HAS TO SAY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT NIPPERS WOULD I NOT BE JUSTIFIED IN IMMEDIATELY DISMISSING BARTLEBY EXCUSE ME
1571-141320-0027 AND INDEED UNJUST AS REGARDS TURKEY AND MYSELF BUT IT MAY ONLY BE A PASSING WHIM AH EXCLAIMED I YOU HAVE STRANGELY CHANGED YOUR MIND THEN YOU SPEAK VERY GENTLY OF HIM NOW ALL BEER CRIED TURKEY
1571-141320-0028 GENTLENESS IS EFFECTS OF BEER NIPPERS AND I DINED TOGETHER TO DAY YOU SEE HOW GENTLE I AM SIR SHALL I GO AND BLACK HIS EYES YOU REFER TO BARTLEBY I SUPPOSE NO NOT TO DAY TURKEY I REPLIED
1571-141320-0029 PRAY PUT UP YOUR FISTS I CLOSED THE DOORS AND AGAIN ADVANCED TOWARDS BARTLEBY I FELT ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES TEMPTING ME TO MY FATE I BURNED TO BE REBELLED AGAINST AGAIN I REMEMBERED THAT BARTLEBY NEVER LEFT THE OFFICE BARTLEBY
1571-141320-0030 SAID I GINGER NUT IS AWAY JUST STEP ROUND TO THE POST OFFICE WON'T YOU IT WAS BUT A THREE MINUTE WALK AND SEE IF THERE IS ANY THING FOR ME I WOULD PREFER NOT TO YOU WILL NOT I PREFER NOT
1571-141320-0031 I STAGGERED TO MY DESK AND SAT THERE IN A DEEP STUDY MY BLIND INVETERACY RETURNED WAS THERE ANY OTHER THING IN WHICH I COULD PROCURE MYSELF TO BE IGNOMINIOUSLY REPULSED BY THIS LEAN PENNILESS WIGHT MY HIRED CLERK
1571-141320-0032 WHAT ADDED THING IS THERE PERFECTLY REASONABLE THAT HE WILL BE SURE TO REFUSE TO DO BARTLEBY NO ANSWER BARTLEBY IN A LOUDER TONE NO ANSWER BARTLEBY I ROARED
1571-141320-0033 LIKE A VERY GHOST AGREEABLY TO THE LAWS OF MAGICAL INVOCATION AT THE THIRD SUMMONS HE APPEARED AT THE ENTRANCE OF HIS HERMITAGE GO TO THE NEXT ROOM AND TELL NIPPERS TO COME TO ME I PREFER NOT TO
1571-141320-0034 HE RESPECTFULLY AND SLOWLY SAID AND MILDLY DISAPPEARED VERY GOOD BARTLEBY SAID I IN A QUIET SORT OF SERENELY SEVERE SELF POSSESSED TONE INTIMATING THE UNALTERABLE PURPOSE OF SOME TERRIBLE RETRIBUTION VERY CLOSE AT HAND
1571-141320-0035 AT THE MOMENT I HALF INTENDED SOMETHING OF THE KIND BUT UPON THE WHOLE AS IT WAS DRAWING TOWARDS MY DINNER HOUR I THOUGHT IT BEST TO PUT ON MY HAT AND WALK HOME FOR THE DAY SUFFERING MUCH FROM PERPLEXITY AND DISTRESS OF MIND
1571-141320-0036 SHALL I ACKNOWLEDGE IT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS WHOLE BUSINESS WAS THAT IT SOON BECAME A FIXED FACT OF MY CHAMBERS THAT A PALE YOUNG SCRIVENER BY THE NAME OF BARTLEBY AND A DESK THERE
1571-141320-0037 THAT HE COPIED FOR ME AT THE USUAL RATE OF FOUR CENTS A FOLIO ONE HUNDRED WORDS BUT HE WAS PERMANENTLY EXEMPT FROM EXAMINING THE WORK DONE BY HIM THAT DUTY BEING TRANSFERRED TO TURKEY AND NIPPERS ONE OF COMPLIMENT DOUBTLESS TO THEIR SUPERIOR ACUTENESS
1571-141320-0038 MOREOVER SAID BARTLEBY WAS NEVER ON ANY ACCOUNT TO BE DISPATCHED ON THE MOST TRIVIAL ERRAND OF ANY SORT AND THAT EVEN IF ENTREATED TO TAKE UPON HIM SUCH A MATTER IT WAS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WOULD PREFER NOT TO IN OTHER WORDS THAT HE WOULD REFUSE POINTBLANK
1571-141320-0039 AS DAYS PASSED ON I BECAME CONSIDERABLY RECONCILED TO BARTLEBY HIS STEADINESS HIS FREEDOM FROM ALL DISSIPATION HIS INCESSANT INDUSTRY EXCEPT WHEN HE CHOSE TO THROW HIMSELF INTO A STANDING REVERY BEHIND HIS SCREEN
1571-141320-0040 HIS GREAT STILLNESS HIS UNALTERABLENESS OF DEMEANOR UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES MADE HIM A VALUABLE ACQUISITION ONE PRIME THING WAS THIS HE WAS ALWAYS THERE FIRST IN THE MORNING CONTINUALLY THROUGH THE DAY AND THE LAST AT NIGHT
1571-141320-0041 OF COURSE FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN THE USUAL ANSWER I PREFER NOT TO WAS SURE TO COME AND THEN HOW COULD A HUMAN CREATURE WITH THE COMMON INFIRMITIES OF OUR NATURE REFRAIN FROM BITTERLY EXCLAIMING UPON SUCH PERVERSENESS
1571-141320-0042 HERE IT MUST BE SAID THAT ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF MOST LEGAL GENTLEMEN OCCUPYING CHAMBERS IN DENSELY POPULATED LAW BUILDINGS THERE WERE SEVERAL KEYS TO MY DOOR ONE WAS KEPT BY A WOMAN RESIDING IN THE ATTIC
1571-141320-0043 NOW ONE SUNDAY MORNING I HAPPENED TO GO TO TRINITY CHURCH TO HEAR A CELEBRATED PREACHER AND FINDING MYSELF RATHER EARLY ON THE GROUND I THOUGHT I WOULD WALK AROUND TO MY CHAMBERS FOR A WHILE LUCKILY I HAD MY KEY WITH ME
1571-141320-0044 BUT UPON APPLYING IT TO THE LOCK I FOUND IT RESISTED BY SOMETHING INSERTED FROM THE INSIDE QUITE SURPRISED I CALLED OUT WHEN TO MY CONSTERNATION A KEY WAS TURNED FROM WITHIN AND THRUSTING HIS LEAN VISAGE AT ME AND HOLDING THE DOOR AJAR
1571-141320-0045 IN A BRIEF WORD OR TWO HE MOREOVER ADDED THAT PERHAPS I HAD BETTER WALK ROUND THE BLOCK TWO OR THREE TIMES AND BY THAT TIME HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE CONCLUDED HIS AFFAIRS
1571-141320-0046 TENANTING MY LAW CHAMBERS OF A SUNDAY MORNING WITH HIS CADAVEROUSLY GENTLEMANLY NONCHALANCE YET WITHAL FIRM AND SELF POSSESSED HAD SUCH A STRANGE EFFECT UPON ME THAT INCONTINENTLY I SLUNK AWAY FROM MY OWN DOOR AND DID AS DESIRED
1571-141320-0047 BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY TWINGES OF IMPOTENT REBELLION AGAINST THE MILD EFFRONTERY OF THIS UNACCOUNTABLE SCRIVENER
1571-141320-0048 FURTHERMORE I WAS FULL OF UNEASINESS AS TO WHAT BARTLEBY COULD POSSIBLY BE DOING IN MY OFFICE IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES AND IN AN OTHERWISE DISMANTLED CONDITION OF A SUNDAY MORNING WAS ANY THING AMISS GOING ON NAY THAT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION
1571-141320-0049 IT WAS NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF FOR A MOMENT THAT BARTLEBY WAS AN IMMORAL PERSON BUT WHAT COULD HE BE DOING THERE COPYING NAY AGAIN WHATEVER MIGHT BE HIS ECCENTRICITIES BARTLEBY WAS AN EMINENTLY DECOROUS PERSON
1571-141320-0050 NEVERTHELESS MY MIND WAS NOT PACIFIED AND FULL OF A RESTLESS CURIOSITY AT LAST I RETURNED TO THE DOOR WITHOUT HINDRANCE I INSERTED MY KEY OPENED IT AND ENTERED BARTLEBY WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
1571-141320-0051 I LOOKED ROUND ANXIOUSLY PEEPED BEHIND HIS SCREEN
1571-141320-0052 BORE THE FAINT IMPRESS OF A LEAN RECLINING FORM ROLLED AWAY UNDER HIS DESK I FOUND A BLANKET UNDER THE EMPTY GRATE A BLACKING BOX AND BRUSH ON A CHAIR A TIN BASIN WITH SOAP AND A RAGGED TOWEL
1571-141320-0053 IN A NEWSPAPER A FEW CRUMBS OF GINGER NUTS AND A MORSEL OF CHEESE YES THOUGHT I IT IS EVIDENT ENOUGH THAT BARTLEBY HAS BEEN MAKING HIS HOME HERE KEEPING BACHELOR'S HALL ALL BY HIMSELF IMMEDIATELY THEN THE THOUGHT CAME SWEEPING ACROSS ME
1571-141320-0054 WHAT MISERABLE FRIENDLESSNESS AND LONELINESS ARE HERE REVEALED HIS POVERTY IS GREAT BUT HIS SOLITUDE HOW HORRIBLE THINK OF IT OF A SUNDAY WALL STREET IS DESERTED AS PETRA AND EVERY NIGHT OF EVERY DAY IT IS AN EMPTINESS
1603-139324-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE GRAHAM SPEAKS HIS WORD
1603-139324-0001 THE MASTER OF THE EARTH WAS NOT EVEN MASTER OF HIS OWN MIND EVEN HIS WILL SEEMED A WILL NOT HIS OWN HIS OWN ACTS SURPRISED HIM
1603-139324-0002 THESE THINGS WERE DEFINITE THE NEGROES WERE COMING HELEN WOTTON HAD WARNED THE PEOPLE OF THEIR COMING AND HE WAS MASTER OF THE EARTH EACH OF THESE FACTS SEEMED STRUGGLING FOR COMPLETE POSSESSION OF HIS THOUGHTS THEY PROTRUDED FROM A BACKGROUND OF SWARMING HALLS
1603-139324-0003 ELEVATED PASSAGES ROOMS JAMMED WITH WARD LEADERS IN COUNCIL KINEMATOGRAPH AND TELEPHONE ROOMS AND WINDOWS LOOKING OUT ON A SEETHING SEA OF MARCHING MEN THE MEN IN YELLOW AND MEN WHOM HE FANCIED WERE CALLED WARD LEADERS
1603-139324-0004 PERHAPS THEY WERE DOING A LITTLE OF BOTH PERHAPS SOME POWER UNSEEN AND UNSUSPECTED PROPELLED THEM ALL HE WAS AWARE THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE A PROCLAMATION TO THE PEOPLE OF THE EARTH AWARE OF CERTAIN GRANDIOSE PHRASES FLOATING IN HIS MIND AS THE THING HE MEANT TO SAY
1603-139324-0005 MANY LITTLE THINGS HAPPENED AND THEN HE FOUND HIMSELF WITH THE MAN IN YELLOW ENTERING A LITTLE ROOM WHERE THIS PROCLAMATION OF HIS WAS TO BE MADE THIS ROOM WAS GROTESQUELY LATTER DAY IN ITS APPOINTMENTS IN THE CENTRE WAS A BRIGHT OVAL
1603-139324-0006 LIT BY SHADED ELECTRIC LIGHTS FROM ABOVE THE REST WAS IN SHADOW AND THE DOUBLE FINELY FITTING DOORS THROUGH WHICH HE CAME FROM THE SWARMING HALL OF THE ATLAS MADE THE PLACE VERY STILL THE DEAD THUD OF THESE AS THEY CLOSED BEHIND HIM
1603-139324-0007 THE SUDDEN CESSATION OF THE TUMULT IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN LIVING FOR HOURS THE QUIVERING CIRCLE OF LIGHT THE WHISPERS AND QUICK NOISELESS MOVEMENTS OF VAGUELY VISIBLE ATTENDANTS IN THE SHADOWS HAD A STRANGE EFFECT UPON GRAHAM
1603-139324-0008 HE WALKED INTO THE CENTRE OF THE LIGHT AND HIS SHADOW DREW TOGETHER BLACK AND SHARP TO A LITTLE BLOT AT HIS FEET THE VAGUE SHAPE OF THE THING HE MEANT TO SAY WAS ALREADY IN HIS MIND BUT THIS SILENCE THIS ISOLATION THE WITHDRAWAL FROM THAT CONTAGIOUS CROWD
1603-139324-0009 THIS AUDIENCE OF GAPING GLARING MACHINES HAD NOT BEEN IN HIS ANTICIPATION ALL HIS SUPPORTS SEEMED WITHDRAWN TOGETHER HE SEEMED TO HAVE DROPPED INTO THIS SUDDENLY SUDDENLY TO HAVE DISCOVERED HIMSELF IN A MOMENT HE WAS CHANGED
1603-139324-0010 HE FOUND THAT HE NOW FEARED TO BE INADEQUATE HE FEARED TO BE THEATRICAL HE FEARED THE QUALITY OF HIS VOICE THE QUALITY OF HIS WIT ASTONISHED HE TURNED TO THE MAN IN YELLOW WITH A PROPITIATORY GESTURE FOR A MOMENT HE SAID I MUST WAIT
1603-139324-0011 I MUST THINK OF THE THING I HAVE TO SAY
1603-139324-0012 THERE CAME AN AGITATED MESSENGER WITH NEWS THAT THE FOREMOST AEROPLANES WERE PASSING OVER MADRID WHAT NEWS OF THE FLYING STAGES HE ASKED THE PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH WEST WARDS ARE READY READY
1603-139324-0013 I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE A SORT OF SPEECH WOULD TO GOD I KNEW CERTAINLY THE THING THAT SHOULD BE SAID AEROPLANES AT MADRID THEY MUST HAVE STARTED BEFORE THE MAIN FLEET OH WHAT CAN IT MATTER WHETHER I SPEAK WELL OR ILL HE SAID AND FELT THE LIGHT GROW BRIGHTER
1603-139324-0014 HE HAD FRAMED SOME VAGUE SENTENCE OF DEMOCRATIC SENTIMENT WHEN SUDDENLY DOUBTS OVERWHELMED HIM HIS BELIEF IN HIS HEROIC QUALITY AND CALLING HE FOUND HAD ALTOGETHER LOST ITS ASSURED CONVICTION
1603-139324-0015 HE THOUGHT OF THAT SWIFT FLIGHT OF AEROPLANES LIKE THE SWOOP OF FATE TOWARDS HIM HE WAS ASTONISHED THAT HE COULD HAVE SEEN THINGS IN ANY OTHER LIGHT IN THAT FINAL EMERGENCY HE DEBATED THRUST DEBATE RESOLUTELY ASIDE DETERMINED AT ALL COSTS TO GO THROUGH WITH THE THING HE HAD UNDERTAKEN
1603-139324-0016 AND HE COULD FIND NO WORD TO BEGIN EVEN AS HE STOOD AWKWARD HESITATING WITH AN INDISCREET APOLOGY FOR HIS INABILITY TREMBLING ON HIS LIPS CAME THE NOISE OF MANY PEOPLE CRYING OUT
1603-139324-0017 WAIT CRIED SOMEONE AND A DOOR OPENED GRAHAM TURNED AND THE WATCHING LIGHTS WANED THROUGH THE OPEN DOORWAY HE SAW A SLIGHT GIRLISH FIGURE APPROACHING HIS HEART LEAPT IT WAS HELEN WOTTON THE MAN IN YELLOW CAME OUT OF THE NEARER SHADOWS INTO THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT
1603-139324-0018 THIS IS THE GIRL WHO TOLD US WHAT OSTROG HAD DONE HE SAID SHE CAME IN VERY QUIETLY AND STOOD STILL AS IF SHE DID NOT WANT TO INTERRUPT GRAHAM'S ELOQUENCE
1603-139324-0019 HE TURNED BACK TO HER YOU HAVE HELPED ME HE SAID LAMELY HELPED ME VERY MUCH THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT HE PAUSED HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE UNSEEN MULTITUDES WHO STARED UPON HIM THROUGH THOSE GROTESQUE BLACK EYES AT FIRST HE SPOKE SLOWLY
1603-139324-0020 MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NEW AGE HE SAID YOU HAVE ARISEN TO DO BATTLE FOR THE RACE THERE IS NO EASY VICTORY BEFORE US HE STOPPED TO GATHER WORDS HE WISHED PASSIONATELY FOR THE GIFT OF MOVING SPEECH
1603-139324-0021 THIS BATTLE THAT IS COMING THIS BATTLE THAT RUSHES UPON US TO NIGHT IS ONLY A BEGINNING ALL YOUR LIVES IT MAY BE YOU MUST FIGHT TAKE NO THOUGHT THOUGH I AM BEATEN THOUGH I AM UTTERLY OVERTHROWN I THINK I MAY BE OVERTHROWN
1603-139324-0022 HE FOUND THE THING IN HIS MIND TOO VAGUE FOR WORDS HE PAUSED MOMENTARILY AND BROKE INTO VAGUE EXHORTATIONS AND THEN A RUSH OF SPEECH CAME UPON HIM MUCH THAT HE SAID WAS BUT THE HUMANITARIAN COMMONPLACE OF A VANISHED AGE
1603-139324-0023 BUT THE CONVICTION OF HIS VOICE TOUCHED IT TO VITALITY HE STATED THE CASE OF THE OLD DAYS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE NEW AGE TO THE GIRL AT HIS SIDE I COME OUT OF THE PAST TO YOU HE SAID WITH THE MEMORY OF AN AGE THAT HOPED
1603-139324-0024 MY AGE WAS AN AGE OF DREAMS OF BEGINNINGS AN AGE OF NOBLE HOPES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WE HAD MADE AN END OF SLAVERY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WE HAD SPREAD THE DESIRE AND ANTICIPATION THAT WARS MIGHT CEASE THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN MIGHT LIVE NOBLY
1603-139324-0025 IN FREEDOM AND PEACE SO WE HOPED IN THE DAYS THAT ARE PAST AND WHAT OF THOSE HOPES HOW IS IT WITH MAN AFTER TWO HUNDRED YEARS GREAT CITIES VAST POWERS A COLLECTIVE GREATNESS BEYOND OUR DREAMS FOR THAT WE DID NOT WORK
1603-139324-0026 AND THAT HAS COME BUT HOW IS IT WITH THE LITTLE LIVES THAT MAKE UP THIS GREATER LIFE HOW IS IT WITH THE COMMON LIVES AS IT HAS EVER BEEN SORROW AND LABOUR LIVES CRAMPED AND UNFULFILLED LIVES TEMPTED BY POWER TEMPTED BY WEALTH
1603-139324-0027 AND GONE TO WASTE AND FOLLY THE OLD FAITHS HAVE FADED AND CHANGED THE NEW FAITH IS THERE A NEW FAITH CHARITY AND MERCY HE FLOUNDERED BEAUTY AND THE LOVE OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS EFFORT AND DEVOTION
1603-139324-0028 GIVE YOURSELVES AS I WOULD GIVE MYSELF AS CHRIST GAVE HIMSELF UPON THE CROSS IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU UNDERSTAND IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU SEEM TO FAIL YOU KNOW IN THE CORE OF YOUR HEARTS YOU KNOW THERE IS NO PROMISE
1603-139324-0029 BUT WITH ALL HIS HEART AND STRENGTH OF THIS NEW FAITH WITHIN HIM HE SPOKE OF THE GREATNESS OF SELF ABNEGATION OF HIS BELIEF IN AN IMMORTAL LIFE OF HUMANITY IN WHICH WE LIVE AND MOVE AND HAVE OUR BEING HIS VOICE ROSE AND FELL
1603-139324-0030 NO DOUBT OF HIS HEROIC WORDS HE HAD IT ALL STRAIGHT AND PLAIN HIS ELOQUENCE LIMPED NO LONGER AND AT LAST HE MADE AN END TO SPEAKING HERE AND NOW HE CRIED I MAKE MY WILL ALL THAT IS MINE IN THE WORLD
1603-139324-0031 ALL THAT IS MINE IN THE WORLD I GIVE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD TO ALL OF YOU I GIVE IT TO YOU AND MYSELF I GIVE TO YOU AND AS GOD WILLS TO NIGHT I WILL LIVE FOR YOU OR I WILL DIE HE ENDED
1603-139324-0032 HE FOUND THE LIGHT OF HIS PRESENT EXALTATION REFLECTED IN THE FACE OF THE GIRL THEIR EYES MET HER EYES WERE SWIMMING WITH TEARS OF ENTHUSIASM I KNEW SHE WHISPERED OH FATHER OF THE WORLD SIRE I KNEW YOU WOULD SAY THESE THINGS
1603-139325-0000 THEY HAVE DONE WONDERS YOU MUST SEND THEM A WORD TO HELP THEM ON THEIR WAY GRAHAM STARED AT HIM ABSENT MINDEDLY THEN WITH A START
1603-139325-0001 YES HE SAID THAT IS GOOD THAT IS GOOD HE WEIGHED A MESSAGE TELL THEM WELL DONE SOUTH WEST HE TURNED HIS EYES TO HELEN WOTTON AGAIN HIS FACE EXPRESSED HIS STRUGGLE BETWEEN CONFLICTING IDEAS
1603-139325-0002 WE MUST CAPTURE THE FLYING STAGES HE EXPLAINED UNLESS WE CAN DO THAT THEY WILL LAND NEGROES AT ALL COSTS WE MUST PREVENT THAT HE FELT EVEN AS HE SPOKE THAT THIS WAS NOT WHAT HAD BEEN IN HIS MIND BEFORE THE INTERRUPTION
1603-139325-0003 HE SAW HER FACE RESPOND HERE I AM DOING NOTHING HE SAID IT IS IMPOSSIBLE PROTESTED THE MAN IN YELLOW IT IS A FIGHT IN A WARREN YOUR PLACE IS HERE HE EXPLAINED ELABORATELY HE MOTIONED TOWARDS THE ROOM WHERE GRAHAM MUST WAIT
1603-139325-0004 BUT HERE WAS NO SPECTACULAR BATTLE FIELD SUCH AS HE IMAGINED INSTEAD WAS SECLUSION AND SUSPENSE
1603-139325-0005 INAUDIBLY AND INVISIBLY WITHIN FOUR MILES OF HIM BENEATH THE ROEHAMPTON STAGE A STRANGE AND UNPRECEDENTED CONTEST IT WAS A BATTLE THAT WAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND LITTLE BATTLES A BATTLE IN A SPONGE OF WAYS AND CHANNELS
1603-139325-0006 WHOSE SECRET MANUFACTURE AND SUDDEN DISTRIBUTION IN ENORMOUS QUANTITIES HAD BEEN ONE OF OSTROG'S CULMINATING MOVES AGAINST THE COUNCIL
1603-139325-0007 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH IT HELD ITSELF VACANT UNTIL THE AEROPLANES SHOULD COME EVER AND AGAIN THERE WAS NEWS OF THESE DRAWING NEARER FROM THIS SPANISH TOWN AND THEN THAT AND PRESENTLY FROM FRANCE BUT OF THE NEW GUNS THAT OSTROG HAD MADE AND WHICH WERE KNOWN TO BE IN THE CITY
1603-139325-0008 CAME NO NEWS IN SPITE OF GRAHAM'S URGENCY NOR ANY REPORT OF SUCCESSES FROM THE DENSE FELT OF FIGHTING STRANDS ABOUT THE FLYING STAGES SECTION AFTER SECTION OF THE LABOUR SOCIETIES REPORTED ITSELF ASSEMBLED REPORTED ITSELF MARCHING AND VANISHED FROM KNOWLEDGE INTO THE LABYRINTH OF THAT WARFARE
1603-139325-0009 WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE EVEN THE BUSY WARD LEADERS DID NOT KNOW IN SPITE OF THE OPENING AND CLOSING OF DOORS
1603-139325-0010 GRAHAM FELT ISOLATED STRANGELY INACTIVE INOPERATIVE HIS ISOLATION SEEMED AT TIMES THE STRANGEST THE MOST UNEXPECTED OF ALL THE THINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE HIS AWAKENING IT HAD SOMETHING OF THE QUALITY OF THAT INACTIVITY THAT COMES IN DREAMS A TUMULT
1603-139325-0011 THE STUPENDOUS REALISATION OF A WORLD STRUGGLE BETWEEN OSTROG AND HIMSELF
1603-139325-0012 NOW THE DOOR WOULD BE CLOSED AND GRAHAM AND HELEN WERE ALONE TOGETHER THEY SEEMED SHARPLY MARKED OFF THEN FROM ALL THE UNPRECEDENTED WORLD STORM THAT RUSHED TOGETHER WITHOUT VIVIDLY AWARE OF ONE ANOTHER ONLY CONCERNED WITH ONE ANOTHER THEN THE DOOR WOULD OPEN AGAIN MESSENGERS WOULD ENTER

1603-139325-0019 THIS MONOPLANE IT IS A CHANCE YOU DON'T MEAN TO FIGHT YES TO FIGHT IN THE AIR

1603-139325-0023 HE SWEPT THE ALTERNATIVE ASIDE BY A GESTURE AND THEY STOOD LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER THEY WERE BOTH CLEAR THAT HE MUST GO THERE WAS NO STEP BACK FROM THESE TOWERING HEROISMS HER EYES BRIMMED WITH TEARS SHE CAME TOWARDS HIM WITH A CURIOUS MOVEMENT OF HER HANDS
1603-139325-0024 AS THOUGH SHE FELT HER WAY AND COULD NOT SEE SHE SEIZED HIS HAND AND KISSED IT TO WAKE SHE CRIED FOR THIS HE HELD HER CLUMSILY FOR A MOMENT AND KISSED THE HAIR OF HER BOWED HEAD AND THEN THRUST HER AWAY AND TURNED TOWARDS THE MAN IN YELLOW
1603-140931-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN STRANGE TO SAY THE ANGER OF THE RATURANS WAS NOT ASSUAGED BY THE REBUFF WHICH THEY RECEIVED AT THAT TIME THEY TOOK COUNSEL AGAIN
1603-140931-0001 AND THEN ATTACK THEM WHEN OFF THEIR GUARD MEANWHILE ZEPPA
1603-140931-0002 THE DAY ON WHICH THE IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM OPENED HIS MOUTH AND GAVE FORTH THE FIRST NOTES OF A HYMN IN A FINE SONOROUS BASS VOICE THE CHILD GAZED AT HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS IN OPEN EYED WONDER AND THEN BURST INTO AN UNCONTROLLABLE FIT OF OPEN MOUTHED LAUGHTER
1603-140931-0003 THIS GAZE WAS EVIDENTLY REGARDED BY LIPPY AS AN ADDITIONAL TOUCH OF HUMOUR FOR SHE WENT OFF INTO RENEWED EXPLOSIONS OF DELIGHT AND THE LESSON HAD TO BE GIVEN UP FOR THAT TIME ZEPPA WAS GIFTED HOWEVER WITH PATIENT PERSEVERANCE IN A REMARKABLE DEGREE
1603-140931-0004 SHE WENT WRONG IN ONE OR TWO NOTES HOWEVER WHICH GAVE ZEPPA THE OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING HER RIGHT HE TOOK HER ON HIS KNEE AND TOLD HER
1603-140931-0005 AND HER TEACHER GAZED AT HER WITH INTENSE PLEASURE DEPICTED ON HIS HANDSOME FACE UNTIL SHE REACHED THE NOTE
1603-140931-0006 NO NOT SO SING THUS HE SAID GIVING THE RIGHT NOTES THE PUPIL TOOK IT UP AT ONCE AND THUS THE SINGING LESSONS WERE FAIRLY BEGUN BUT THE MATTER DID NOT REST HERE FOR LIPPY PROUD OF HER NEW ACQUIREMENT
1603-140931-0007 SOON BEGAN TO EXHIBIT HER POWERS TO HER LITTLE COMPANIONS AND ERE LONG A FEW OF THE SMALLEST OF THESE VENTURED TO CREEP INTO ZEPPA'S HUT WHILE THE DAILY LESSON WAS GOING ON GRADUALLY THEY GREW BOLDER AND JOINED IN THE EXERCISE ZEPPA TOOK PLEASURE IN HELPING THEM
1603-140931-0008 AND AT LAST PERMITTED AS MANY AS COULD CROWD INTO HIS HUT TO DO SO THOSE WHO COULD NOT GET INSIDE SAT ON THE GROUND OUTSIDE AND AS THE HUT WAS OPEN IN FRONT THE GATHERING SOON INCREASED THUS INSENSIBLY WITHOUT A WELL DEFINED INTENTION OR EFFORT ON THE PART OF ANY ONE
1603-140931-0009 THE ASSEMBLING OF THESE CHILDREN FOR THEIR LESSON BROUGHT POWERFULLY TO ZEPPA'S MIND ONE DAY THE MEETINGS OF THE RATINGA PEOPLE FOR WORSHIP AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF BEGINNING WITH PRAYER OCCURRED TO HIM ACCORDINGLY THAT MORNING JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO COMMENCE THE HYMNS HE CLASPED HIS HANDS
1603-140931-0010 AND BRIEFLY ASKED GOD'S BLESSING ON THE WORK
1603-140931-0011 AND BEFORE THEY HAD TIME TO RECOVER THE PRAYER WAS OVER ZEPPA'S MODE OF TERMINATING THE ASSEMBLY WAS CHARACTERISTIC HE DID NOT LIKE TO ORDER THE CHILDREN AWAY MUCH LESS TO PUT THEM OUT OF HIS HUT
1603-140931-0012 THEY FELT THAT NOTHING SHORT OF EXTERMINATION WOULD SUFFICE AND THEY WERE RIGHT EXTERMINATION OF THE SINNERS OR THE SINS WAS INDEED THEIR ONLY CHANCE OF PEACE NOT KNOWING THE GOSPEL METHOD OF BLOTTING OUT THE LATTER THEIR ONE RESOURCE LAY IN OBLITERATING THE FORMER
1603-140931-0013 UNTIL THE ENTIRE FORCE OF THE TRIBE WAS UNDER HIS COMMAND LEAVING THE AGED MEN AND BOYS TO PROTECT THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN THOSE DARK SKINNED WARRIORS MARCHED AWAY TO BATTLE NOT WITH THE FLAUNTING BANNERS AND MARTIAL MUSIC OF CIVILISED MAN BUT WITH THE PROFOUND SILENCE AND THE STEALTHY TREAD OF THE SAVAGE
1603-140931-0014 AND SPARE JAVELINS BUT BEING A NIGHT ATTACK THE FIGHTING MEN WENT ALONE EACH ARMED WITH A HEAVY CLUB A LIGHT SPEAR AND A STONE KNIFE OR HATCHET
1603-140931-0015 THE MAIN BODY WAS HALTED AND SCOUTS WERE SENT OUT IN ADVANCE TO SEE THAT ALL WAS CLEAR THEN THE PLAN OF ATTACK WAS FORMED ONE DETACHMENT WAS TO APPROACH THE ENEMY'S VILLAGE ON THE RIGHT
1603-140931-0016 THERE IS A PROVERB RELATING TO THE PLANS OF MEN AS WELL AS MICE WHICH RECEIVES VERIFICATION IN EVERY LAND AND TIME ITS TRUTH RECEIVED CORROBORATION AT THIS TIME ON SUGAR LOAF ISLAND ON THAT SAME NIGHT IT CHANCED THAT THE CHIEF ONGOLOO WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP
1603-140931-0017 HE SENT FOR HIS PRIME MINISTERIAL JESTER AND ONE OF HIS CHIEFS TO WHOM HE PROPOSED A RAMBLE THE CHIEF AND JESTER PROFESSED THEMSELVES CHARMED WITH THE PROPOSAL ALTHOUGH EACH HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM A PLEASANT SLUMBER IN THE COURSE OF THE RAMBLE THEY CAME UNEXPECTEDLY ON ONE OF THE RATURAN SCOUTS
1603-140931-0018 WHOM THEY TEMPORARILY EXTINGUISHED WITH A CLUB ONGOLOO BECAME AT ONCE ALIVE TO THE SITUATION AND TOOK INSTANT ACTION WAPOOTA HE SAID IN AN EXCITED WHISPER RUN TO THE REAR OF THE FOE GO SWIFTLY LIKE THE SEA BIRD WHEN YOU GET THERE YELL SHRIEK LIKE LIKE YOU KNOW HOW
1603-140931-0019 AS YOU DID LAST TIME CHANGE YOUR GROUND AT EACH YELL SO THEY WILL THINK YOU A HOST FEAR NOT TO BE CAPTURED YOUR DEATH IS NOTHING AWAY A KICK FACILITATED WAPOOTA'S FLIGHT AND THE TWO CHIEFS RETURNED AT SPEED TO ROUSE THE SLEEPING CAMP WAPOOTA PERFORMED HIS PART NOBLY
1603-140931-0020 AND WITHOUT BEING CAPTURED FOR HE DID NOT AGREE WITH ONGOLOO AS TO THE UNIMPORTANCE OF HIS OWN DEATH AT THE UNEXPECTED OUTCRY IN THE REAR THE RATURANS HALTED AND HELD A HASTY COUNCIL OF WAR LET US GO BACK AND FIGHT THEM SAID ONE NO USE THEY ARE EVIL SPIRITS NOT MEN SAID ANOTHER
1603-140931-0021 WHILE WE WASTE TIME HERE SAID THE LEADING CHIEF THE MOUNTAIN DOGS WILL GET READY FOR US COME FORWARD THE CHIEF WAS RIGHT ONGOLOO'S RUSE CAUSED DELAY SO THAT WHEN THE RATURANS REACHED THE VILLAGE THEY FOUND ARMED MEN READY TO RECEIVE THEM
1603-140931-0022 THE WOMEN SCATTERED AND FLED THE SAVAGE WARRIORS PURSUED
1603-140931-0023 ALTHOUGH HE HAD REFUSED TO GO OUT TO WAR WITH HIS ENTERTAINERS HE FELT NO DISPOSITION TO STAND IDLY BY WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED DISORDERED THOUGH HIS MIND WAS HE COULD MAKE A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN AGGRESSIVE WAR AND SELF DEFENCE
1603-140931-0024 AS THE TIDE OF BATTLE FLOWED AND VICTORY LEANED SOMETIMES TO ONE SIDE SOMETIMES TO THE OTHER ZEPPA WAS UNARMED AS HE DREW NEAR HE WAS OBSERVED BY BOTH PARTIES TO STOP ABRUPTLY IN HIS CAREER AND WRENCH OUT OF THE GROUND A STAKE
1603-140931-0025 THAT HAD BEEN MEANT FOR THE CORNER POST OF A NEWLY BEGUN HUT IT RESEMBLED THE GREAT CLUB OF HERCULES RATHER THAN A WEAPON OF MODERN MAN WHIRLING IT LIKE A FEATHER ROUND HIS HEAD THE MANIAC RUSHED ON HE WAS THOROUGHLY ROUSED A FEELING OF DESPERATE ANXIETY COUPLED WITH A SENSE OF HORRIBLE INJUSTICE
1603-140931-0026 HAD SET HIS SPIRIT IN A BLAZE HIS GREAT SIZE WHICH BECAME MORE APPARENT AS HE ADVANCED HIS FLASHING EYES COMPRESSED LIPS
1603-140931-0027 GAVE HIM ALTOGETHER AN ASPECT SO TERRIBLE
1603-140931-0029 THEN HURLING THE MIGHTY CLUB AWAY AS IF IT WERE A MERE HINDRANCE TO HIM HE RAN STRAIGHT AT THE LEADER OF THE RATURANS WHO BEING HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE HIS FELLOWS SEEMED A SUITABLE FOE TO SINGLE OUT BEFORE REACHING HIM HOWEVER
1603-140931-0030 WHO WAS HARD PRESSED AT THE TIME BY A CROWD OF OPPONENTS ONE ROAR FROM THE MANIAC SENT THESE FLYING LIKE CHAFF BEFORE THE WIND IT MUST BE ADDED HOWEVER FOR THE CREDIT OF THE MEN OF RATURA THAT ONGOLOO AND HIS WARRIORS HAD BACKED UP THEIR NEW LEADER GALLANTLY
1603-140931-0031 RAN WITH HIM AT RACING SPEED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RATURAN VILLAGES
1603-140931-0032 BUT IF IT HAD BEEN THIRTY HUNDRED IT WOULD HAVE MADE NO DIFFERENCE IN THE EFFECT OF ZEPPA'S ROAR AND ASPECT AS HE RUSHED UPON THEM WITH OBVIOUSLY AWFUL INTENTIONS THOUGH WITHOUT ARMS IN FACT THE LATTER CIRCUMSTANCE TENDED RATHER TO INCREASE THE FEARS OF THE SUPERSTITIOUS NATIVES
1603-140931-0033 THEY FLED AS ONE MAN AT THE FIRST SIGHT OF THE MANIAC AND LIPPY WAS RECOVERED INSTANTLY ZEPPA'S FEROCITY VANISHED AND THE TENDEREST OF SMILES RIPPLED OVER HIS FACE AS HE TOOK THE CHILD IN HIS ARMS AND KISSED HER BUT WAPOOTA DID NOT FEEL QUITE SO EASY
1603-140931-0034 BUT THEY DID NOT AS IN FORMER TIMES RETURN TO SLAY THE AGED AND CARRY THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN INTO CAPTIVITY TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL HIS FOLLOWERS AND THE ANGER OF NOT A FEW ONGOLOO COMMANDED HIS MEN TO RETURN TO THEIR VILLAGE AND LEAVE THE RATURANS ALONE ONE OF HIS CHIEFS
1603-140931-0035 WHO SHOWED A DISPOSITION TO RESIST HIS AUTHORITY HE PROMPTLY KNOCKED DOWN WHEREUPON THE REST BECAME OBEDIENT AND WENT QUIETLY HOME ON REACHING THE VILLAGE ZEPPA WENT STRAIGHT TO HIS HUT WITH LIPPY ON HIS SHOULDER APPARENTLY HE HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE RECENT FIGHT FOR WITHOUT EVEN WAITING TO TAKE FOOD OR REST
1603-140931-0036 WHO FELT THAT SHE WAS ONLY RECEIVING HER DUE THE CHILD ACCEPTED THE ATTENTION HER YOUNG COMPANIONS ATTRACTED BY THE SWEET SOUNDS SOON FLOCKED TO THE OLD PLACE OF RENDEZVOUS AND WHEN THE LAST OF THE STRAGGLING WARRIORS RETURNED FROM THE FIELD OF BATTLE THEY FOUND THE SINGING CLASS GOING FULL SWING AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
1603-140931-0037 OTHER SOUNDS BEGAN TO ARISE SOUNDS OF WAILING AND WOE WHICH SOON DROWNED THE HYMNS OF PRAISE AS SOON AS ZEPPA BECAME FULLY ALIVE TO THIS FACT
1603-140931-0038 AND PASSED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS BROW AS IF TO CLEAR AWAY SOME MISTY CLOUDS THAT RESTED THERE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS SHATTERED INTELLECT HAD TAKEN IN A VERY IMPERFECT IMPRESSION OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED AS IF TO GET RID OF THIS BECLOUDED STATE HE STARTED OFF THAT EVENING AT A QUICK WALK
1603-140931-0039 NO ONE EVER FOLLOWED HIM ON THESE OCCASIONS THE NATIVES REGARDED HIS PERSON AS IN SOME MEASURE SACRED AND WOULD HAVE DEEMED IT NOT ONLY DANGEROUS BUT INSOLENT TO GO UP AMONG THE ROCKY HEIGHTS WHEN THE MADMAN WAS KNOWN TO BE THERE ONCE INDEED WAPOOTA
1603-140931-0040 WITH THAT PRESUMPTUOUS TEMERITY WHICH IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF FOOLS IN GENERAL VENTURED ON THE STRENGTH OF OLD ACQUAINTANCE TO FOLLOW HIM AND EVEN WENT TOWARDS THE WELL KNOWN CAVE WHERE HE HAD FOUND REFUGE AND PROTECTION IN THE DAY OF HIS DISTRESS
1603-140931-0041 BUT ZEPPA HAD EITHER FORGOTTEN HIS FORMER INTERCOURSE WITH THE JESTER OR INTENDED TO REPUDIATE THE CONNECTION FOR HE DID NOT RECEIVE HIM KINDLY ON THE WAY UP WAPOOTA WHO FELT SOMEWHAT TIMOROUS ABOUT THE VISIT
1603-140931-0042 HAD MADE UP HIS MIND AS TO THE BEST MODE OF ADDRESS WITH WHICH TO APPROACH HIS FRIEND HE HAD DECIDED THAT ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY YOUTHFUL THE LANGUAGE AND MANNER OF A RESPECTFUL SON TO A REVERED FATHER WOULD BEST BEFIT THE OCCASION
1603-140931-0043 HE ASSUMED A STOOPING ATTITUDE OF PROFOUND RESPECT AND DREW NEAR ZEPPA LOOKED UP WITH A FROWN AS IF ANNOYED AT THE INTRUSION YOUR UNWORTHY SON BEGAN WAPOOTA COMES TO BUT HE GOT NO FURTHER HE COULD NOT WELL HAVE HIT UPON A MORE UNFORTUNATE PHRASE
1603-140931-0044 AND SAW THE MANIAC BOUND OVER THE FIRE TOWARDS HIM BUT HE SAW AND HEARD NO MORE FOR HIS LIMBS BECAME SUDDENLY ENDUED WITH SOMETHING LIKE ELECTRIC VITALITY HE TURNED AND SHOT OVER A SMALL PRECIPICE AS IF FLUNG FROM AN ANCIENT CATAPULT WHAT HE ALIGHTED ON HE DID NOT KNOW STILL LESS DID HE CARE
1603-140931-0045 AND INTENSIFIED THE ELECTRIC BATTERY WITHIN HIM HE WENT DOWN THE SLOPES REGARDLESS OF GRADIENT AT A PACE THAT MIGHT HAVE LEFT EVEN ZEPPA BEHIND IF HE HAD FOLLOWED BUT ZEPPA DID NOT FOLLOW WHEN WAPOOTA WENT OVER THE PRECIPICE AND DISAPPEARED ZEPPA HALTED AND STOOD ERECT
1603-141713-0000 HIS FAVOURITE COMPANION AND CONFIDENT HE FOUND HIM AS NECESSARY IN THE CONDUCT OF HIS AFFAIRS AS THE KING OF BABYLON HAD BEFORE DONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HIS GOVERNMENT AND LUCKY IT WAS FOR ZADIG
1603-141713-0001 HE DISCOVER'D THAT HIS MASTER WAS IN HIS TEMPER BENEVOLENT STRICTLY HONEST AND A MAN OF GOOD NATURAL PARTS ZADIG WAS VERY MUCH CONCERN'D THAT ONE OF SO MUCH SENSE SHOULD PAY DIVINE ADORATION TO A WHOLE HOST OF CREATED
1603-141713-0002 HE TALK'D AT FIRST TO HIS MASTER WITH GREAT PRECAUTION ON SO IMPORTANT A TOPICK BUT AT LAST TOLD HIM IN DIRECT TERMS THAT THEY WERE CREATED BODIES AS OTHERS THO OF LESS LUSTRE AND THAT THERE WAS NO MORE ADORATION DUE TO THEM THAN TO A STOCK OR A STONE
1603-141713-0003 BUT SAID SETOC THEY ARE ETERNAL BEINGS TO WHOM WE ARE INDEBTED FOR ALL THE BLESSINGS WE ENJOY THEY ANIMATE NATURE THEY REGULATE THE SEASONS THEY ARE IN A WORD AT SUCH AN INFINITE DISTANCE FROM US THAT IT WOULD BE DOWNRIGHT IMPIOUS NOT TO ADORE THEM
1603-141713-0004 YOU ARE MORE INDEBTED SAID ZADIG TO THE WATERS OF THE RED SEA WHICH TRANSPORT SO MANY VALUABLE COMMODITIES INTO THE INDIES WHY PRAY
1603-141713-0005 WHY DON'T YOU ADORE THE LAND OF THE GANGARIDES
1603-141713-0006 HE FELL PROSTRATE ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE WAX LIGHTS O YE EVERLASTING EVER SHINING LUMINARIES
1603-141713-0007 HAVING REPEATED THESE WORDS SO LOUD AS SETOC MIGHT HEAR THEM HE SAT DOWN TO TABLE WITHOUT TAKING THE LEAST NOTICE OF SETOC WHAT SAID SETOC SOMEWHAT STARTLED AT HIS CONDUCT ART THOU AT THY PRAYERS BEFORE SUPPER I ACT JUST AS INCONSISTENTLY SIR AS YOU DO
1603-141713-0008 I WORSHIP THESE CANDLES WITHOUT REFLECTING ON THEIR MAKERS OR YOURSELF WHO ARE MY MOST BENEFICENT PATRON SETOC TOOK THE HINT AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE REPROOF THAT WAS CONCEAL'D SO GENTEELY UNDER A VAIL THE SUPERIOR WISDOM OF HIS SLAVE ENLIGHTNED HIS MIND
1603-141713-0009 AND FROM THAT HOUR HE WAS LESS LAVISH THAN EVER HE HAD BEEN OF HIS INCENSE TO THOSE CREATED BEINGS AND FOR THE FUTURE
1603-141713-0010 AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A MOST HIDEOUS CUSTOM IN HIGH REPUTE ALL OVER ARABIA WHICH CAME ORIGINALLY FROM SCYTHIA BUT HAVING MET WITH THE SANCTION OF THE BIGOTTED BRACHMANS THREATN'D TO SPREAD ITS INFECTION ALL OVER THE EAST WHEN A MARRIED MAN HAPPEN'D TO DIE
1603-141713-0011 HAPPEN'D JUST AT THAT JUNCTURE TO BE DEAD AND HIS WIDOW
1603-141713-0012 PUBLISH'D THE DAY NAY THE HOUR THAT SHE PROPOS'D TO THROW HERSELF ACCORDING TO CUSTOM ON HER DECEASED HUSBAND'S FUNERAL PILE AND BE ATTENDED BY A CONCERT OF DRUMS AND TRUMPETS
1603-141713-0013 OR BY THE EDUCATION OF SUCH AS DEMANDED THEIR MATERNAL INDULGENCE AND
1603-141713-0014 HE FORC'D FROM HIM AT LAST AN INGENUOUS CONFESSION THAT THE BARBAROUS CUSTOM THEN SUBSISTING OUGHT IF POSSIBLE TO BE ABOLISH'D TIS NOW REPLIED SETOC ABOVE A THOUSAND YEARS SINCE THE WIDOWS OF ARABIA HAVE BEEN INDULG'D WITH THIS PRIVILEGE OF DYING WITH THEIR HUSBANDS
1603-141713-0015 DO YOU COMMUNICATE THESE SENTIMENTS TO THE SOVEREIGNS OF YOUR TRIBES AND IN THE MEAN WHILE I'LL GO AND SOUND THE WIDOW'S INCLINATIONS ACCORDINGLY HE PAID HER A VISIT AND HAVING INSINUATED HIMSELF INTO HER FAVOUR
1603-141713-0016 I AM A PROFESS'D DEVOTEE AND SHOULD I SHEW THE LEAST RELUCTANCE MY REPUTATION WOULD BE LOST FOR EVER ALL THE WORLD WOULD LAUGH AT ME SHOULD I NOT BURN MYSELF ON THIS OCCASION
1603-141713-0017 AND OUT OF PRIDE AND OSTENTATION THAN ANY REAL LOVE FOR THE DECEAS'D HE TALK'D TO HER FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME SO RATIONALLY
1607-134636-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CHARACTER OF CONSTANTINE AND HIS SONS PART TWO
1607-134636-0001 THE INHERITANCE OF THE EMPIRE SEEMED TO DEVOLVE ON THE THREE SONS OF FAUSTA WHO HAVE BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED UNDER THE NAMES OF CONSTANTINE OF CONSTANTIUS AND OF CONSTANS THESE YOUNG PRINCES WERE SUCCESSIVELY INVESTED WITH THE TITLE OF CAESAR
1607-134636-0002 AND THE DATES OF THEIR PROMOTION MAY BE REFERRED TO THE TENTH THE TWENTIETH
1607-134636-0003 MIGHT BE EXCUSED BY THE PARTIALITY OF PATERNAL AFFECTION BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVES OF THE EMPEROR WHEN HE ENDANGERED THE SAFETY BOTH OF HIS FAMILY AND OF HIS PEOPLE BY THE UNNECESSARY ELEVATION
1607-134636-0004 OF HIS TWO NEPHEWS DALMATIUS AND HANNIBALIANUS THE FORMER WAS RAISED BY THE TITLE OF CAESAR TO AN EQUALITY WITH HIS COUSINS IN FAVOR OF THE LATTER CONSTANTINE INVENTED THE NEW AND SINGULAR APPELLATION
1607-134636-0005 IN ANY AGE OF THE EMPIRE HANNIBALIANUS ALONE WAS DISTINGUISHED BY THE TITLE OF KING
1607-134636-0006 THE USE OF SUCH A TITLE
1607-134636-0007 AND THE DUTIES OF ACTIVE LIFE THOSE WHO OCCASIONALLY MENTION THE EDUCATION OR TALENTS OF CONSTANTIUS ALLOW THAT HE EXCELLED IN THE GYMNASTIC ARTS OF LEAPING AND RUNNING THAT HE WAS A DEXTEROUS ARCHER A SKILFUL HORSEMAN
1607-134636-0008 AND A MASTER OF ALL THE DIFFERENT WEAPONS USED IN THE SERVICE EITHER OF THE CAVALRY
1607-134636-0009 THOUGH NOT PERHAPS WITH EQUAL SUCCESS
1607-134636-0010 AND OF THE ROMAN JURISPRUDENCE WERE INVITED BY THE LIBERALITY OF THE EMPEROR WHO RESERVED FOR HIMSELF THE IMPORTANT TASK OF INSTRUCTING THE ROYAL YOUTHS IN THE SCIENCE OF GOVERNMENT AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF MANKIND
1607-134636-0011 BUT THE GENIUS OF CONSTANTINE HIMSELF HAD BEEN FORMED BY ADVERSITY AND EXPERIENCE
1607-134636-0012 HE HAD LEARNED TO COMMAND HIS OWN PASSIONS TO ENCOUNTER THOSE OF HIS EQUALS AND TO DEPEND FOR HIS PRESENT SAFETY AND FUTURE GREATNESS ON THE PRUDENCE AND FIRMNESS OF HIS PERSONAL CONDUCT HIS DESTINED SUCCESSORS
1607-134636-0013 IN THE IMPERIAL PURPLE INCESSANTLY SURROUNDED WITH A TRAIN OF FLATTERERS THEY PASSED THEIR YOUTH IN THE ENJOYMENT OF LUXURY AND THE EXPECTATION OF A THRONE
1607-134636-0014 APPEAR TO WEAR A SMOOTH AND UNIFORM ASPECT THE INDULGENCE OF CONSTANTINE ADMITTED THEM AT A VERY TENDER AGE TO SHARE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE EMPIRE AND THEY STUDIED THE ART OF REIGNING AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PEOPLE INTRUSTED TO THEIR CARE
1607-134636-0015 THE ANCIENT PATRIMONY OF THEIR FATHER FOR THE MORE OPULENT BUT LESS MARTIAL COUNTRIES OF THE EAST ITALY
1607-134636-0016 AND AFRICA WERE ACCUSTOMED TO REVERE CONSTANS THE THIRD OF HIS SONS AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GREAT CONSTANTINE HE FIXED DALMATIUS ON THE GOTHIC FRONTIER TO WHICH HE ANNEXED THE GOVERNMENT OF THRACE MACEDONIA AND GREECE
1607-134636-0017 AND THE PROVINCES OF PONTUS CAPPADOCIA
1607-134636-0018 WERE DESTINED TO FORM THE EXTENT OF HIS NEW KINGDOM FOR EACH OF THESE PRINCES A SUITABLE ESTABLISHMENT WAS PROVIDED A JUST PROPORTION OF GUARDS OF LEGIONS AND OF AUXILIARIES WAS ALLOTTED FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE DIGNITY AND DEFENCE
1607-134636-0019 THE MINISTERS AND GENERALS WHO WERE PLACED ABOUT THEIR PERSONS WERE SUCH AS CONSTANTINE COULD TRUST TO ASSIST AND EVEN TO CONTROL THESE YOUTHFUL SOVEREIGNS IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR DELEGATED POWER AS THEY ADVANCED IN YEARS AND EXPERIENCE
1607-134636-0020 THE LIMITS OF THEIR AUTHORITY WERE INSENSIBLY ENLARGED
1607-134636-0021 WITH THE FIGURE AND COMPLEXION OF THE ANCIENT INHABITANTS OF EUROPE ACCORDING TO THE VARIOUS ACCIDENTS OF PEACE AND WAR OF ALLIANCE OR CONQUEST
1607-134636-0022 THE PURSUIT OF GAME AND THE EXERCISES OF WAR OR RATHER OF RAPINE DIRECTED THE VAGRANT MOTIONS OF THE SARMATIANS THE MOVABLE CAMPS OR CITIES THE ORDINARY RESIDENCE OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN
1607-134636-0023 CONSISTED ONLY OF LARGE WAGONS DRAWN BY OXEN AND COVERED IN THE FORM OF TENTS THE MILITARY STRENGTH OF THE NATION WAS COMPOSED OF CAVALRY AND THE CUSTOM OF THEIR WARRIORS TO LEAD IN THEIR HAND ONE OR TWO SPARE HORSES
1607-134636-0024 ENABLED THEM TO ADVANCE AND TO RETREAT WITH A RAPID DILIGENCE WHICH SURPRISED THE SECURITY AND ELUDED THE PURSUIT
1607-134636-0025 WHICH WAS CAPABLE OF RESISTING A SWORD OR JAVELIN
1607-134636-0026 CUT INTO THIN AND POLISHED SLICES CAREFULLY LAID OVER EACH OTHER IN THE MANNER OF SCALES OR FEATHERS
1607-134636-0027 THEY WERE REDUCED TO THE NECESSITY OF EMPLOYING FISH BONES FOR THE POINTS OF THEIR WEAPONS
1607-134636-0028 THAT POISONED THE WOUNDS WHICH THEY INFLICTED IS ALONE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THE MOST SAVAGE MANNERS SINCE A PEOPLE IMPRESSED WITH A SENSE OF HUMANITY WOULD HAVE ABHORRED SO CRUEL A PRACTICE AND A NATION SKILLED IN THE ARTS OF WAR
1607-134636-0029 THEIR SHAGGY BEARDS UNCOMBED LOCKS
1607-134636-0030 WHERE HE WAS EXPOSED ALMOST WITHOUT DEFENCE TO THE FURY OF THESE MONSTERS OF THE DESERT
1607-134636-0031 AND FROM THE ACCOUNTS OF HISTORY THERE IS SOME REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THESE SARMATIANS WERE THE JAZYGAE ONE OF THE MOST NUMEROUS AND WARLIKE TRIBES OF THE NATION THE ALLUREMENTS OF PLENTY ENGAGED THEM
1607-134636-0032 TO SEEK A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE SOON AFTER THE REIGN OF AUGUSTUS THEY OBLIGED THE DACIANS
1607-134636-0033 TIBISCUS TO RETIRE INTO THE HILLY COUNTRY AND TO ABANDON TO THE VICTORIOUS SARMATIANS THE FERTILE PLAINS OF THE UPPER HUNGARY
1607-134636-0034 THEY WATCHED OR SUSPENDED THE MOMENT OF ATTACK AS THEY WERE PROVOKED BY INJURIES OR APPEASED BY PRESENTS THEY GRADUALLY ACQUIRED THE SKILL OF USING MORE DANGEROUS WEAPONS AND ALTHOUGH THE SARMATIANS DID NOT ILLUSTRATE THEIR NAME BY ANY MEMORABLE EXPLOITS
1607-134636-0035 WITH A FORMIDABLE BODY OF CAVALRY
1607-134636-0036 WHO YIELDED TO THE PRESSURE OF THE GOTHIC POWER THEY SEEM TO HAVE CHOSEN A KING FROM THAT NATION
1607-134636-0037 THE GOTHIC KINGS ASPIRED TO EXTEND THEIR DOMINION FROM THE EUXINE TO THE FRONTIERS OF GERMANY
1607-134636-0038 WERE STAINED WITH THE BLOOD OF THE CONTENDING BARBARIANS AFTER SOME EXPERIENCE OF THE SUPERIOR STRENGTH AND NUMBERS OF THEIR ADVERSARIES THE SARMATIANS IMPLORED THE PROTECTION OF THE ROMAN MONARCH WHO BEHELD WITH PLEASURE THE DISCORD OF THE NATIONS
1607-134636-0039 BUT WHO WAS JUSTLY ALARMED BY THE PROGRESS OF THE GOTHIC ARMS AS SOON AS CONSTANTINE HAD DECLARED HIMSELF IN FAVOR OF THE WEAKER PARTY THE HAUGHTY ARARIC KING OF THE GOTHS INSTEAD OF EXPECTING THE ATTACK OF THE LEGIONS
1607-134636-0040 BOLDLY PASSED THE DANUBE AND SPREAD TERROR AND DEVASTATION THROUGH THE PROVINCE OF MAESIA TO OPPOSE THE INROAD OF THIS DESTROYING HOST THE AGED EMPEROR TOOK THE FIELD IN PERSON
1607-134636-0041 HE HAD THE MORTIFICATION OF SEEING HIS TROOPS FLY BEFORE AN INCONSIDERABLE DETACHMENT
1607-149245-0000 FROM THE BUSINESS OF PERSECUTING THE DALRYMPLE FAMILY TO THE IMPORTANT AND PRESSING QUESTION OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT THEY SAID THAT THE OLD SYSTEM HAD BEEN ABOLISHED THAT NO OTHER SYSTEM HAD BEEN SUBSTITUTED
1607-149245-0001 THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION OF THE KINGDOM AND THAT THE FIRST DUTY OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO PUT AN END TO AN ANARCHY WHICH WAS DAILY PRODUCING DISASTERS AND CRIMES
1607-149245-0002 THE LEADERS OF THE CLUB WERE NOT TO BE SO DRAWN AWAY FROM THEIR OBJECT IT WAS MOVED AND RESOLVED THAT THE CONSIDERATION OF ECCLESIASTICAL AFFAIRS SHOULD BE POSTPONED TILL SECULAR AFFAIRS HAD BEEN SETTLED
1607-149245-0003 THE UNJUST AND ABSURD ACT OF INCAPACITATION WAS CARRIED BY SEVENTY FOUR VOICES TO TWENTY FOUR ANOTHER VOTE STILL MORE OBVIOUSLY AIMED AT THE HOUSE OF STAIR SPEEDILY FOLLOWED
1607-149245-0004 THE PARLIAMENT LAID CLAIM TO A VETO ON THE NOMINATION OF THE JUDGES AND ASSUMED THE POWER OF STOPPING THE SIGNET IN OTHER WORDS OF SUSPENDING THE WHOLE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE TILL THIS CLAIM SHOULD BE ALLOWED
1607-149245-0005 IT WAS PLAIN FROM WHAT PASSED IN DEBATE THAT THOUGH THE CHIEFS OF THE CLUB HAD BEGUN WITH THE COURT OF SESSION THEY DID NOT MEAN TO END THERE THE ARGUMENTS USED BY SIR PATRICK HUME AND OTHERS
1607-149245-0006 LED DIRECTLY TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE KING OUGHT NOT TO HAVE THE APPOINTMENT OF ANY GREAT PUBLIC FUNCTIONARY SIR PATRICK INDEED AVOWED BOTH IN SPEECH AND IN WRITING HIS OPINION THAT THE WHOLE PATRONAGE OF THE REALM
1607-149245-0007 OUGHT TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE CROWN TO THE ESTATES WHEN THE PLACE OF TREASURER
1607-149245-0008 SO MUCH PROVOKED BY THEIR PERVERSENESS THAT AFTER LONG TEMPORISING HE REFUSED TO TOUCH EVEN ACTS WHICH WERE IN THEMSELVES UNOBJECTIONABLE AND TO WHICH HIS INSTRUCTIONS EMPOWERED HIM TO CONSENT
1607-149245-0009 THIS STATE OF THINGS WOULD HAVE ENDED IN SOME GREAT CONVULSION IF THE KING OF SCOTLAND HAD NOT BEEN ALSO KING OF A MUCH GREATER AND MORE OPULENT KINGDOM CHARLES THE FIRST HAD NEVER FOUND ANY PARLIAMENT AT WESTMINSTER
1607-149245-0010 MORE UNMANAGEABLE THAN WILLIAM DURING THIS SESSION FOUND THE PARLIAMENT AT EDINBURGH BUT IT WAS NOT IN THE POWER OF THE PARLIAMENT AT EDINBURGH TO PUT ON WILLIAM SUCH A PRESSURE AS THE PARLIAMENT AT WESTMINSTER HAD PUT ON CHARLES
1607-149245-0011 A REFUSAL OF SUPPLIES AT WESTMINSTER WAS A SERIOUS THING AND LEFT THE SOVEREIGN NO CHOICE EXCEPT TO YIELD OR TO RAISE MONEY BY UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEANS BUT A REFUSAL OF SUPPLIES AT EDINBURGH
1607-149245-0012 REDUCED HIM TO NO SUCH DILEMMA THE LARGEST SUM THAT HE COULD HOPE TO RECEIVE FROM SCOTLAND IN A YEAR WAS LESS THAN WHAT HE RECEIVED FROM ENGLAND EVERY FORTNIGHT
1607-149245-0013 MORE DILIGENTLY CULTIVATED AND MORE THICKLY PEOPLED THAN THE GREATER PART OF THE HIGHLANDS THE MEN WHO FOLLOWED HIS BANNER WERE SUPPOSED TO BE NOT LESS NUMEROUS THAN ALL THE MACDONALDS AND MACLEANS UNITED
1607-149245-0014 AND WERE IN STRENGTH AND COURAGE INFERIOR TO NO TRIBE IN THE MOUNTAINS BUT THE CLAN HAD BEEN MADE INSIGNIFICANT BY THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHIEF THE MARQUESS WAS THE FALSEST THE MOST FICKLE
1607-149245-0015 THE MOST PUSILLANIMOUS OF MANKIND ALREADY IN THE SHORT SPACE OF SIX MONTHS HE HAD BEEN SEVERAL TIMES A JACOBITE AND SEVERAL TIMES A WILLIAMITE BOTH JACOBITES AND WILLIAMITES REGARDED HIM WITH CONTEMPT AND DISTRUST
1607-149245-0016 WHICH RESPECT FOR HIS IMMENSE POWER PREVENTED THEM FROM FULLY EXPRESSING AFTER REPEATEDLY VOWING FIDELITY TO BOTH PARTIES AND REPEATEDLY BETRAYING BOTH HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD BEST PROVIDE FOR HIS SAFETY
1607-149245-0017 BY ABDICATING THE FUNCTIONS BOTH OF A PEER AND OF A CHIEFTAIN BY ABSENTING HIMSELF BOTH FROM THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE AT EDINBURGH AND FROM HIS CASTLE IN THE MOUNTAINS AND BY QUITTING THE COUNTRY TO WHICH HE WAS BOUND BY EVERY TIE OF DUTY AND HONOUR
1607-149245-0018 FOR THEY HAD BEEN EMPLOYED BY HIM ONLY FOUR YEARS BEFORE AS THE MINISTERS OF HIS VENGEANCE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ARGYLE THEY HAD GARRISONED INVERARY THEY HAD RAVAGED LORN THEY HAD DEMOLISHED HOUSES CUT DOWN FRUIT TREES
1607-149245-0019 BURNED FISHING BOATS BROKEN MILLSTONES HANGED CAMPBELLS AND WERE THEREFORE NOT LIKELY TO BE PLEASED BY THE PROSPECT OF MAC CALLUM MORES RESTORATION ONE WORD FROM THE MARQUESS
1607-149245-0020 WOULD HAVE SENT TWO THOUSAND CLAYMORES TO THE JACOBITE SIDE BUT THAT WORD HE WOULD NOT SPEAK AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE CONDUCT OF HIS FOLLOWERS WAS AS IRRESOLUTE AND INCONSISTENT AS HIS OWN
1607-149245-0021 WHILE THEY WERE WAITING FOR SOME INDICATION OF HIS WISHES THEY WERE CALLED TO ARMS AT ONCE BY TWO LEADERS EITHER OF WHOM MIGHT WITH SOME SHOW OF REASON CLAIM TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ABSENT CHIEF
1607-149245-0022 LORD MURRAY THE MARQUESS'S ELDEST SON WHO WAS MARRIED TO A DAUGHTER OF THE DUKE OF HAMILTON DECLARED FOR KING WILLIAM STEWART OF BALLENACH THE MARQUESS'S CONFIDENTIAL AGENT
1607-149245-0023 DECLARED FOR KING JAMES THE PEOPLE KNEW NOT WHICH SUMMONS TO OBEY HE WHOSE AUTHORITY WOULD HAVE BEEN HELD IN PROFOUND REVERENCE HAD PLIGHTED FAITH TO BOTH SIDES
1607-149245-0024 AND HAD THEN RUN AWAY FOR FEAR OF BEING UNDER THE NECESSITY OF JOINING EITHER NOR WAS IT VERY EASY TO SAY
1607-149245-0025 BELONGED TO HIS STEWARD OR TO HIS HEIR APPARENT THE MOST IMPORTANT MILITARY POST IN ATHOL WAS BLAIR CASTLE THE HOUSE WHICH NOW BEARS THAT NAME IS NOT DISTINGUISHED BY ANY STRIKING PECULIARITY
1607-149245-0026 FROM OTHER COUNTRY SEATS OF THE ARISTOCRACY THE OLD BUILDING WAS A LOFTY TOWER OF RUDE ARCHITECTURE
1607-149245-0027 THE WALLS WOULD HAVE OFFERED VERY LITTLE RESISTANCE TO A BATTERING TRAIN BUT WERE QUITE STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP THE HERDSMEN OF THE GRAMPIANS IN AWE ABOUT FIVE MILES SOUTH OF THIS STRONGHOLD
1607-149245-0028 OF KILLIECRANKIE AT PRESENT A HIGHWAY AS SMOOTH AS ANY ROAD IN MIDDLESEX
1607-149245-0029 WHITE VILLAS PEEP FROM THE BIRCH FOREST AND ON A FINE SUMMER DAY THERE IS SCARCELY A TURN OF THE PASS AT WHICH MAY NOT BE SEEN SOME ANGLER CASTING HIS FLY ON THE FOAM OF THE RIVER SOME ARTIST SKETCHING A PINNACLE OF ROCK
1607-149245-0030 OR SOME PARTY OF PLEASURE BANQUETING ON THE TURF IN THE FRETWORK OF SHADE AND SUNSHINE BUT IN THE DAYS OF WILLIAM THE THIRD KILLIECRANKIE WAS MENTIONED WITH HORROR BY THE PEACEFUL AND INDUSTRIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE PERTHSHIRE LOWLANDS
1607-149245-0031 IT WAS DEEMED THE MOST PERILOUS OF ALL THOSE DARK RAVINES THROUGH WHICH THE MARAUDERS OF THE HILLS WERE WONT TO SALLY FORTH THE SOUND SO MUSICAL TO MODERN EARS
1607-149245-0032 OF THE RIVER BRAWLING ROUND THE MOSSY ROCKS AND AMONG THE SMOOTH PEBBLES THE DARK MASSES OF CRAG AND VERDURE WORTHY OF THE PENCIL OF WILSON THE FANTASTIC PEAKS BATHED AT SUNRISE AND SUNSET
1607-149245-0033 SUGGESTED TO OUR ANCESTORS THOUGHTS OF MURDEROUS AMBUSCADES AND OF BODIES STRIPPED GASHED AND ABANDONED TO THE BIRDS OF PREY
1607-149245-0034 THAT THE WEAPONS BY WHICH THE HIGHLANDERS COULD BE MOST EFFECTUALLY SUBDUED WERE THE PICKAXE AND THE SPADE THE COUNTRY WHICH LAY JUST ABOVE THIS PASS WAS NOW THE THEATRE OF A WAR SUCH AS THE HIGHLANDS HAD NOT OFTEN WITNESSED
1607-149245-0035 MEN WEARING THE SAME TARTAN AND ATTACHED TO THE SAME LORD WERE ARRAYED AGAINST EACH OTHER THE NAME OF THE ABSENT CHIEF WAS USED WITH SOME SHOW OF REASON ON BOTH SIDES BALLENACH AT THE HEAD OF A BODY OF VASSALS
1607-149245-0036 WHO CONSIDERED HIM AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MARQUESS OCCUPIED BLAIR CASTLE MURRAY WITH TWELVE HUNDRED FOLLOWERS APPEARED BEFORE THE WALLS AND DEMANDED TO BE ADMITTED
1607-149245-0037 THAT THE CRISIS REQUIRED PROMPT AND STRENUOUS EXERTION ON THE FATE OF BLAIR CASTLE PROBABLY DEPENDED THE FATE OF ALL ATHOL ON THE FATE OF ATHOL MIGHT DEPEND THE FATE OF SCOTLAND MACKAY HASTENED NORTHWARD
1607-149245-0038 AND ORDERED HIS TROOPS TO ASSEMBLE IN THE LOW COUNTRY OF PERTHSHIRE SOME OF THEM WERE QUARTERED AT SUCH A DISTANCE THAT THEY DID NOT ARRIVE IN TIME
1607-149245-0039 WHICH HAD SERVED IN HOLLAND AND WHICH BORE THE NAMES OF THEIR COLONELS MACKAY HIMSELF BALFOUR AND RAMSAY THERE WAS ALSO A GALLANT REGIMENT OF INFANTRY FROM ENGLAND THEN CALLED HASTINGS'S BUT NOW KNOWN AS THE THIRTEENTH OF THE LINE
1607-149245-0040 ONE OF THEM WAS COMMANDED BY LORD KENMORE THE OTHER WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED ON THE BORDER AND WHICH IS STILL STYLED THE KING'S OWN BORDERERS BY LORD LEVEN TWO TROOPS OF HORSE LORD ANNANDALE'S AND LORD BELHAVEN'S
1607-149245-0041 PROBABLY MADE UP THE ARMY TO THE NUMBER OF ABOVE THREE THOUSAND MEN
1607-149245-0042 BUT THE CALL WAS SO UNEXPECTED AND THE TIME ALLOWED WAS SO SHORT THAT THE MUSTER WAS NOT A VERY FULL ONE THE WHOLE NUMBER OF BROADSWORDS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN UNDER THREE THOUSAND
1607-149245-0043 WITH THIS FORCE SUCH AS IT WAS DUNDEE SET FORTH ON HIS MARCH HE WAS JOINED BY SUCCOURS WHICH HAD JUST ARRIVED FROM ULSTER THEY CONSISTED OF LITTLE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED IRISH FOOT
1607-149245-0044 INCOMPETENT AS HE WAS HE BORE A COMMISSION WHICH GAVE HIM MILITARY RANK IN SCOTLAND NEXT TO DUNDEE
1607-150715-0000 TO RECOVER THE PROVINCES OF ITALY AND SICILY AND TO CHASTISE THIS PRETENDED KING
1607-150715-0001 WHICH HAD BEEN INEXORABLY PROSCRIBED BY THE LATIN CLERGY AFTER THE LOSS OF HER DUKES APULIA WAS CHAINED AS A SERVILE APPENDAGE TO THE CROWN OF SICILY THE FOUNDER OF THE MONARCHY HAD RULED BY THE SWORD
1607-150715-0002 WITHOUT HEALING THE DISCONTENT OF HIS SUBJECTS THE FEUDAL GOVERNMENT WAS ALWAYS PREGNANT WITH THE SEEDS OF REBELLION AND A NEPHEW OF ROGER HIMSELF INVITED THE ENEMIES OF HIS FAMILY AND NATION THE MAJESTY OF THE PURPLE
1607-150715-0003 AND A SERIES OF HUNGARIAN AND TURKISH WARS
1607-150715-0004 THE GREEK MONARCH INTRUSTED A FLEET AND ARMY
1607-150715-0005 AND IN EVERY OPERATION GOLD AS WELL AS STEEL WAS THE INSTRUMENT OF VICTORY SALERNO AND SOME PLACES ALONG THE WESTERN COAST MAINTAINED THEIR FIDELITY TO THE NORMAN KING
1607-150715-0006 BUT HE LOST IN TWO CAMPAIGNS THE GREATER PART OF HIS CONTINENTAL POSSESSIONS AND THE MODEST EMPEROR DISDAINING ALL FLATTERY AND FALSEHOOD WAS CONTENT WITH THE REDUCTION OF THREE HUNDRED CITIES OR VILLAGES OF APULIA AND CALABRIA
1607-150715-0007 WHOSE NAMES AND TITLES WERE INSCRIBED ON ALL THE WALLS OF THE PALACE THE PREJUDICES OF THE LATINS
1607-150715-0008 CLAIMED THE INDEFEASIBLE DOMINION OF ITALY AND PROFESSED HIS DESIGN OF CHASING THE BARBARIANS BEYOND THE ALPS BY THE ARTFUL SPEECHES LIBERAL GIFTS AND UNBOUNDED PROMISES OF THEIR EASTERN ALLY
1607-150715-0009 AGAINST THE DESPOTISM OF FREDERIC BARBAROSSA
1607-150715-0010 AND HE POURED SAYS THE HISTORIAN A RIVER OF GOLD INTO THE BOSOM OF ANCONA WHOSE ATTACHMENT TO THE GREEKS
1607-150715-0011 RENDERED IT AN IMPORTANT GARRISON IN THE HEART OF ITALY IT WAS TWICE BESIEGED BY THE ARMS OF FREDERIC THE IMPERIAL FORCES WERE TWICE REPULSED BY THE SPIRIT OF FREEDOM THAT SPIRIT WAS ANIMATED BY THE AMBASSADOR OF CONSTANTINOPLE
1607-150715-0012 AND THE MOST INTREPID PATRIOTS THE MOST FAITHFUL SERVANTS
1607-150715-0013 HIS AMBITION WAS EXCITED BY THE HOPE OF STRIPPING THE PURPLE FROM THE GERMAN USURPERS AND OF ESTABLISHING IN THE WEST AS IN THE EAST HIS LAWFUL TITLE OF SOLE EMPEROR OF THE ROMANS
1607-150715-0014 WITH THIS VIEW HE SOLICITED THE ALLIANCE OF THE PEOPLE AND THE BISHOP OF ROME SEVERAL OF THE NOBLES EMBRACED THE CAUSE OF THE GREEK MONARCH THE SPLENDID NUPTIALS OF HIS NIECE WITH ODO FRANGIPANI
1607-150715-0015 THE POPE TWICE RECEIVED IN THE VATICAN THE AMBASSADORS OF CONSTANTINOPLE THEY FLATTERED HIS PIETY BY THE LONG PROMISED UNION OF THE TWO CHURCHES
1607-150715-0016 EXASPERATED A FREE AND COMMERCIAL PEOPLE ONE HUNDRED GALLEYS WERE LAUNCHED AND ARMED IN AS MANY DAYS THEY SWEPT THE COASTS OF DALMATIA AND GREECE BUT AFTER SOME MUTUAL WOUNDS THE WAR WAS TERMINATED BY AN AGREEMENT
1607-150715-0017 INGLORIOUS TO THE EMPIRE INSUFFICIENT FOR THE REPUBLIC AND A COMPLETE VENGEANCE OF THESE AND OF FRESH INJURIES WAS RESERVED FOR THE SUCCEEDING GENERATION
1607-150715-0018 HAD INFORMED HIS SOVEREIGN THAT HE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO QUELL ANY DOMESTIC REVOLT OF APULIA AND CALABRIA BUT THAT HIS FORCES WERE INADEQUATE TO RESIST THE IMPENDING ATTACK OF THE KING OF SICILY
1607-150715-0019 ALIKE EMINENT IN RANK ALIKE DEFECTIVE IN MILITARY TALENTS THE GREEKS WERE OPPRESSED BY LAND AND SEA
1607-150715-0021 BY AN INHUMAN TYRANT WHO HAD DESERVED THE ABHORRENCE OF HIS COUNTRY AND MANKIND THE SWORD OF WILLIAM THE SECOND THE GRANDSON OF ROGER WAS DRAWN BY A FUGITIVE OF THE COMNENIAN RACE
1607-150715-0022 AND THE SUBJECTS OF ANDRONICUS MIGHT SALUTE THE STRANGERS AS FRIENDS
1607-150715-0023 AND ISAAC ANGELUS THE NEW EMPEROR MIGHT INDULGE HIS VANITY OR VENGEANCE IN THE TREATMENT OF FOUR THOUSAND CAPTIVES
1607-150715-0024 THEY ARE STRONGLY DISCRIMINATED BY THE EPITHETS OF THE BAD AND THE GOOD BUT THESE EPITHETS WHICH APPEAR TO DESCRIBE THE PERFECTION OF VICE AND VIRTUE CANNOT STRICTLY BE APPLIED TO EITHER OF THE NORMAN PRINCES
1607-150715-0025 THE FIRST WILLIAM DID NOT DEGENERATE FROM THE VALOR OF HIS RACE BUT HIS TEMPER WAS SLOTHFUL HIS MANNERS WERE DISSOLUTE HIS PASSIONS HEADSTRONG AND MISCHIEVOUS AND THE MONARCH IS RESPONSIBLE NOT ONLY FOR HIS PERSONAL VICES
1607-150715-0026 THE GREAT ADMIRAL WHO ABUSED THE CONFIDENCE AND CONSPIRED AGAINST THE LIFE OF HIS BENEFACTOR FROM THE ARABIAN CONQUEST SICILY HAD IMBIBED A DEEP TINCTURE OF ORIENTAL MANNERS THE DESPOTISM THE POMP
1607-150715-0027 WHICH AFFLICTED PALERMO THE ISLAND AND THE CONTINENT DURING THE REIGN OF WILLIAM THE FIRST
1607-150715-0028 AND THE DREAD OF FUTURITY THE LEGITIMATE MALE POSTERITY OF TANCRED OF HAUTEVILLE WAS EXTINCT IN THE PERSON OF THE SECOND WILLIAM BUT HIS AUNT THE DAUGHTER OF ROGER HAD MARRIED THE MOST POWERFUL PRINCE OF THE AGE
1607-150715-0029 AND HENRY THE SIXTH THE SON OF FREDERIC BARBAROSSA DESCENDED FROM THE ALPS TO CLAIM THE IMPERIAL CROWN AND THE INHERITANCE OF HIS WIFE AGAINST THE UNANIMOUS WISH OF A FREE PEOPLE
1607-150715-0030 THIS INHERITANCE COULD ONLY BE ACQUIRED BY ARMS AND I AM PLEASED TO TRANSCRIBE THE STYLE AND SENSE OF THE HISTORIAN FALCANDUS WHO WRITES AT THE MOMENT AND ON THE SPOT WITH THE FEELINGS OF A PATRIOT
1607-150715-0031 AND THE PROPHETIC EYE OF A STATESMAN CONSTANTIA THE DAUGHTER OF SICILY NURSED FROM HER CRADLE IN THE PLEASURES AND PLENTY AND EDUCATED IN THE ARTS AND MANNERS OF THIS FORTUNATE ISLE
1607-150715-0032 DEPARTED LONG SINCE TO ENRICH THE BARBARIANS WITH OUR TREASURES AND NOW RETURNS WITH HER SAVAGE ALLIES TO CONTAMINATE
1607-150715-0033 CAN UNITE FOR THEIR COMMON SAFETY
1607-150715-0034 THE TERM OF HIS LIFE AND REIGN HE STOOD IN ARMS ON THE FARTHEST VERGE OF THE APULIAN FRONTIER AGAINST THE POWERS OF GERMANY AND THE RESTITUTION OF A ROYAL CAPTIVE
1607-150715-0035 WITHOUT INJURY OR RANSOM MAY APPEAR TO SURPASS THE MOST LIBERAL MEASURE OF POLICY OR REASON AFTER HIS DECEASE THE KINGDOM OF HIS WIDOW AND INFANT SON FELL WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
1607-150715-0036 AND HENRY PURSUED HIS VICTORIOUS MARCH FROM CAPUA TO PALERMO THE POLITICAL BALANCE OF ITALY WAS DESTROYED BY HIS SUCCESS AND IF THE POPE AND THE FREE CITIES HAD CONSULTED THEIR OBVIOUS AND REAL INTEREST
1607-150715-0037 THEY WOULD HAVE COMBINED THE POWERS OF EARTH AND HEAVEN TO PREVENT THE DANGEROUS UNION OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE
1607-150715-0038 WAS TO ABOLISH THE PRIVILEGES AND TO SEIZE THE PROPERTY OF THESE IMPRUDENT ALLIES THE LAST HOPE OF FALCANDUS WAS DEFEATED BY THE DISCORD OF THE CHRISTIANS AND MAHOMETANS THEY FOUGHT IN THE CAPITAL
1607-150715-0039 SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF THE LATTER WERE SLAIN BUT THEIR SURVIVING BRETHREN FORTIFIED THE MOUNTAINS AND DISTURBED ABOVE THIRTY YEARS THE PEACE OF THE ISLAND BY THE POLICY OF FREDERIC THE SECOND SIXTY THOUSAND SARACENS WERE TRANSPLANTED
1607-150715-0040 IN THEIR WARS AGAINST THE ROMAN CHURCH THE EMPEROR AND HIS SON MAINFROY
1607-150715-0041 PALERMO AND THE WHOLE KINGDOM THE PEARLS AND JEWELS HOWEVER PRECIOUS MIGHT BE EASILY REMOVED BUT ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY HORSES
1607-150715-0042 HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND THE NOBLES OF BOTH SEXES WERE SEPARATELY CONFINED IN THE FORTRESSES OF THE ALPS AND ON THE SLIGHTEST RUMOR OF REBELLION THE CAPTIVES WERE DEPRIVED OF LIFE OF THEIR EYES OR OF THE HOPE OF POSTERITY
1607-150715-0043 AND THE HEIRESS OF THE NORMAN LINE MIGHT STRUGGLE TO CHECK HER DESPOTIC HUSBAND AND TO SAVE THE PATRIMONY OF HER NEW BORN SON OF AN EMPEROR SO FAMOUS IN THE NEXT AGE UNDER THE NAME OF FREDERIC THE SECOND TEN YEARS AFTER THIS REVOLUTION
1607-150715-0044 THE FRENCH MONARCHS ANNEXED TO THEIR CROWN THE DUCHY OF NORMANDY THE SCEPTRE OF HER ANCIENT DUKES HAD BEEN TRANSMITTED BY A GRANDDAUGHTER OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR TO THE HOUSE OF PLANTAGENET AND THE ADVENTUROUS NORMANS

1825-135580-0008 ALTHOUGH VERY YOUNG FOR A MISSIONARY HOWEVER ALICE AND HUMPHREY HAD BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL AND PABLO WAS NOW BEGINNING TO COMPREHEND WHAT THEY HAD ATTEMPTED TO INSTILL AND WAS REALLY PROGRESSING DAYLY

1826-142752-0000 THE LIMITS OF PHILOSOPHICAL KNOWLEDGE
1826-142752-0001 IN ALL THAT WE HAVE SAID HITHERTO CONCERNING PHILOSOPHY
1826-142752-0002 THIS HOPE I BELIEVE IS VAIN IT WOULD SEEM THAT KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE IS NOT TO BE OBTAINED BY METAPHYSICS AND THAT THE PROPOSED PROOFS THAT IN VIRTUE OF THE LAWS OF LOGIC SUCH AND SUCH THINGS MUST EXIST
1826-142752-0003 AND SUCH AND SUCH OTHERS CANNOT ARE NOT CAPABLE OF SURVIVING A CRITICAL SCRUTINY IN THIS CHAPTER WE SHALL BRIEFLY CONSIDER THE KIND OF WAY IN WHICH SUCH REASONING IS ATTEMPTED WITH A VIEW TO DISCOVERING WHETHER WE CAN HOPE THAT IT MAY BE VALID
1826-142752-0004 WHICH WE WISH TO EXAMINE WAS HEGEL SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY IS VERY DIFFICULT AND COMMENTATORS DIFFER AS TO THE TRUE INTERPRETATION OF IT
1826-142752-0005 ACCORDING TO THE INTERPRETATION I SHALL ADOPT WHICH IS THAT OF MANY IF NOT MOST OF THE COMMENTATORS AND HAS THE MERIT OF GIVING AN INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT TYPE OF PHILOSOPHY HIS MAIN THESIS IS THAT EVERYTHING SHORT OF THE WHOLE
1826-142752-0006 IS OBVIOUSLY FRAGMENTARY AND OBVIOUSLY INCAPABLE OF EXISTING WITHOUT THE COMPLEMENT SUPPLIED BY THE REST OF THE WORLD JUST AS A COMPARATIVE ANATOMIST FROM A SINGLE BONE SEES WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL THE WHOLE MUST HAVE BEEN
1826-142752-0007 WHICH GRAPPLE IT TO THE NEXT PIECE THE NEXT PIECE IN TURN HAS FRESH HOOKS AND SO ON UNTIL THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS RECONSTRUCTED THIS ESSENTIAL INCOMPLETENESS APPEARS ACCORDING TO HEGEL EQUALLY IN THE WORLD OF THOUGHT AND IN THE WORLD OF THINGS
1826-142752-0008 WHICH ACCORDING TO HIM HAS NO INCOMPLETENESS NO OPPOSITE AND NO NEED OF FURTHER DEVELOPMENT THE ABSOLUTE IDEA THEREFORE IS ADEQUATE TO DESCRIBE ABSOLUTE REALITY BUT ALL LOWER IDEAS ONLY DESCRIBE REALITY
1826-142752-0009 NOT IN ANY DEGREE EVIL WHOLLY RATIONAL AND WHOLLY SPIRITUAL ANY APPEARANCE TO THE CONTRARY IN THE WORLD WE KNOW CAN BE PROVED LOGICALLY SO HE BELIEVES
1826-142752-0010 TO BE ENTIRELY DUE TO OUR FRAGMENTARY PIECEMEAL VIEW OF THE UNIVERSE IF WE SAW THE UNIVERSE WHOLE AS WE MAY SUPPOSE GOD SEES IT SPACE AND TIME AND MATTER AND EVIL AND ALL STRIVING AND STRUGGLING
1826-142752-0011 IN THIS CONCEPTION THERE IS UNDENIABLY SOMETHING SUBLIME SOMETHING TO WHICH WE COULD WISH TO YIELD ASSENT NEVERTHELESS WHEN THE ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF IT ARE CAREFULLY EXAMINED
1826-142752-0012 THEY APPEAR TO INVOLVE MUCH CONFUSION AND MANY UNWARRANTABLE ASSUMPTIONS THE FUNDAMENTAL TENET UPON WHICH THE SYSTEM IS BUILT UP IS THAT WHAT IS INCOMPLETE MUST BE NOT SELF SUBSISTENT
1826-142752-0013 BE WHAT IT IS IF THOSE OUTSIDE THINGS DID NOT EXIST
1826-142752-0014 THUS BUT FOR THE OBJECTS WHICH HE KNOWS OR LOVES OR HATES HE COULD NOT BE WHAT HE IS HE IS ESSENTIALLY AND OBVIOUSLY A FRAGMENT TAKEN AS THE SUM TOTAL OF REALITY HE WOULD BE SELF CONTRADICTORY
1826-142752-0015 THIS WHOLE POINT OF VIEW HOWEVER TURNS UPON THE NOTION OF THE NATURE OF A THING
1826-142752-0016 IS NOT PART OF THE THING ITSELF ALTHOUGH IT MUST ACCORDING TO THE ABOVE USAGE BE PART OF THE NATURE OF THE THING IF WE MEAN BY A THING'S NATURE ALL THE TRUTHS ABOUT THE THING THEN PLAINLY WE CANNOT KNOW A THING'S NATURE
1826-142752-0017 BUT IF THE WORD NATURE IS USED IN THIS SENSE WE SHALL HAVE TO HOLD THAT THE THING MAY BE KNOWN WHEN ITS NATURE IS NOT KNOWN OR AT ANY RATE IS NOT KNOWN COMPLETELY THERE IS A CONFUSION WHEN THIS USE OF THE WORD NATURE IS EMPLOYED
1826-142752-0018 THUS ACQUAINTANCE WITH A THING DOES NOT INVOLVE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS NATURE IN THE ABOVE SENSE AND ALTHOUGH ACQUAINTANCE WITH A THING IS INVOLVED IN OUR KNOWING ANY ONE PROPOSITION ABOUT A THING KNOWLEDGE OF ITS NATURE IN THE ABOVE SENSE IS NOT INVOLVED
1826-142752-0019 HENCE ONE ACQUAINTANCE WITH A THING DOES NOT LOGICALLY INVOLVE A KNOWLEDGE OF ITS RELATIONS AND TWO A KNOWLEDGE OF SOME OF ITS RELATIONS DOES NOT INVOLVE A KNOWLEDGE OF ALL OF ITS RELATIONS NOR A KNOWLEDGE OF ITS NATURE IN THE ABOVE SENSE
1826-142752-0020 FORMS A SINGLE HARMONIOUS SYSTEM SUCH AS HEGEL BELIEVES THAT IT FORMS AND IF WE CANNOT PROVE THIS WE ALSO CANNOT PROVE THE UNREALITY OF SPACE AND TIME AND MATTER AND EVIL FOR THIS IS DEDUCED BY HEGEL
1826-142752-0021 FROM THE FRAGMENTARY AND RELATIONAL CHARACTER OF THESE THINGS THUS WE ARE LEFT TO THE PIECEMEAL INVESTIGATION OF THE WORLD AND ARE UNABLE TO KNOW THE CHARACTERS OF THOSE PARTS OF THE UNIVERSE THAT ARE REMOTE FROM OUR EXPERIENCE
1826-142752-0022 THIS RESULT DISAPPOINTING AS IT IS TO THOSE WHOSE HOPES HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHERS IS IN HARMONY WITH THE INDUCTIVE AND SCIENTIFIC TEMPER OF OUR AGE
1826-142752-0023 AND IS BORNE OUT BY THE WHOLE EXAMINATION OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE WHICH HAS OCCUPIED OUR PREVIOUS CHAPTERS MOST OF THE GREAT AMBITIOUS ATTEMPTS OF METAPHYSICIANS HAVE PROCEEDED BY THE ATTEMPT TO PROVE
1826-142752-0024 THAT SUCH AND SUCH APPARENT FEATURES OF THE ACTUAL WORLD WERE SELF CONTRADICTORY AND THEREFORE COULD NOT BE REAL THE WHOLE TENDENCY OF MODERN THOUGHT HOWEVER IS MORE AND MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF SHOWING THAT THE SUPPOSED CONTRADICTIONS WERE ILLUSORY
1826-142752-0025 A GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF THIS IS AFFORDED BY SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME APPEAR TO BE INFINITE IN EXTENT AND INFINITELY DIVISIBLE IF WE TRAVEL ALONG A STRAIGHT LINE IN EITHER DIRECTION
1826-142752-0026 IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT WE SHALL FINALLY REACH A LAST POINT BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING NOT EVEN EMPTY SPACE SIMILARLY IF IN IMAGINATION WE TRAVEL BACKWARDS OR FORWARDS IN TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT WE SHALL REACH A FIRST OR LAST TIME
1826-142752-0027 WITH NOT EVEN EMPTY TIME BEYOND IT THUS SPACE AND TIME APPEAR TO BE INFINITE IN EXTENT AGAIN IF WE TAKE ANY TWO POINTS ON A LINE IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT THERE MUST BE OTHER POINTS BETWEEN THEM HOWEVER SMALL THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM MAY BE
1826-142752-0028 AD INFINITUM IN TIME SIMILARLY HOWEVER LITTLE TIME MAY ELAPSE BETWEEN TWO MOMENTS IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT THERE WILL BE OTHER MOMENTS BETWEEN THEM THUS SPACE AND TIME APPEAR TO BE INFINITELY DIVISIBLE
1826-142752-0029 BUT AS AGAINST THESE APPARENT FACTS INFINITE EXTENT AND INFINITE DIVISIBILITY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE ADVANCED ARGUMENTS TENDING TO SHOW THAT THERE COULD BE NO INFINITE COLLECTIONS OF THINGS AND THAT THEREFORE THE NUMBER OF POINTS IN SPACE
1826-142752-0030 OR OF INSTANTS IN TIME MUST BE FINITE THUS A CONTRADICTION EMERGED BETWEEN THE APPARENT NATURE OF SPACE AND TIME AND THE SUPPOSED IMPOSSIBILITY OF INFINITE COLLECTIONS
1826-142752-0031 KANT WHO FIRST EMPHASIZED THIS CONTRADICTION DEDUCED THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SPACE AND TIME WHICH HE DECLARED TO BE MERELY SUBJECTIVE AND SINCE HIS TIME VERY MANY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE BELIEVED THAT SPACE AND TIME
1826-142752-0032 ARE MERE APPEARANCE NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF THE WORLD AS IT REALLY IS NOW HOWEVER OWING TO THE LABOURS OF THE MATHEMATICIANS NOTABLY GEORG CANTOR IT HAS APPEARED THAT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF INFINITE COLLECTIONS WAS A MISTAKE
1826-142752-0033 THEY ARE NOT IN FACT SELF CONTRADICTORY BUT ONLY CONTRADICTORY OF CERTAIN RATHER OBSTINATE MENTAL PREJUDICES HENCE THE REASONS FOR REGARDING SPACE AND TIME AS UNREAL HAVE BECOME INOPERATIVE
1826-142752-0034 AND ONE OF THE GREAT SOURCES OF METAPHYSICAL CONSTRUCTIONS IS DRIED UP THE MATHEMATICIANS HOWEVER HAVE NOT BEEN CONTENT WITH SHOWING THAT SPACE AS IT IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED TO BE IS POSSIBLE
1826-142752-0035 THEY HAVE SHOWN ALSO THAT MANY OTHER FORMS OF SPACE ARE EQUALLY POSSIBLE SO FAR AS LOGIC CAN SHOW SOME OF EUCLID'S AXIOMS WHICH APPEAR TO COMMON SENSE TO BE NECESSARY AND WERE FORMERLY SUPPOSED TO BE NECESSARY BY PHILOSOPHERS
1826-142752-0036 ARE NOW KNOWN TO DERIVE THEIR APPEARANCE OF NECESSITY FROM OUR MERE FAMILIARITY WITH ACTUAL SPACE AND NOT FROM ANY A PRIORI LOGICAL FOUNDATION
1826-142752-0037 BY IMAGINING WORLDS IN WHICH THESE AXIOMS ARE FALSE THE MATHEMATICIANS HAVE USED LOGIC TO LOOSEN THE PREJUDICES OF COMMON SENSE AND TO SHOW THE POSSIBILITY OF SPACES DIFFERING SOME MORE SOME LESS
1826-142752-0038 FROM THAT IN WHICH WE LIVE AND SOME OF THESE SPACES DIFFER SO LITTLE FROM EUCLIDEAN SPACE WHERE DISTANCES SUCH AS WE CAN MEASURE ARE CONCERNED
1826-142752-0039 OUR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT MAY BE IS ENORMOUSLY INCREASED INSTEAD OF BEING SHUT IN WITHIN NARROW WALLS OF WHICH EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY COULD BE EXPLORED WE FIND OURSELVES IN AN OPEN WORLD OF FREE POSSIBILITIES
1826-142752-0040 WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE CASE OF SPACE AND TIME HAS HAPPENED TO SOME EXTENT IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS WELL
1826-142752-0041 AND LEAVING TO EXPERIENCE THE TASK OF DECIDING WHERE DECISION IS POSSIBLE BETWEEN THE MANY WORLDS WHICH LOGIC OFFERS FOR OUR CHOICE THUS KNOWLEDGE AS TO WHAT EXISTS BECOMES LIMITED TO WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE
1826-142752-0042 NOT TO WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE FOR AS WE HAVE SEEN THERE IS MUCH KNOWLEDGE BY DESCRIPTION CONCERNING THINGS OF WHICH WE HAVE NO DIRECT EXPERIENCE BUT IN ALL CASES OF KNOWLEDGE BY DESCRIPTION WE NEED SOME CONNEXION OF UNIVERSALS
1826-142752-0043 ENABLING US FROM SUCH AND SUCH A DATUM TO INFER AN OBJECT OF A CERTAIN SORT AS IMPLIED BY OUR DATUM THUS IN REGARD TO PHYSICAL OBJECTS FOR EXAMPLE
1826-142752-0044 IS ITSELF A CONNEXION OF UNIVERSALS AND IT IS ONLY IN VIRTUE OF THIS PRINCIPLE THAT EXPERIENCE ENABLES US TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING PHYSICAL OBJECTS THE SAME APPLIES TO THE LAW OF CAUSALITY
1826-142752-0045 OR TO DESCEND TO WHAT IS LESS GENERAL TO SUCH PRINCIPLES AS THE LAW OF GRAVITATION PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THE LAW OF GRAVITATION ARE PROVED OR RATHER ARE RENDERED HIGHLY PROBABLE
1826-142752-0047 WITH WHICH WE ARE ACQUAINTED AND PURE A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE
1826-142752-0048 IS CRITICISM IT EXAMINES CRITICALLY THE PRINCIPLES EMPLOYED IN SCIENCE AND IN DAILY LIFE IT SEARCHES OUT ANY INCONSISTENCIES THERE MAY BE IN THESE PRINCIPLES AND IT ONLY ACCEPTS THEM WHEN AS THE RESULT OF A CRITICAL INQUIRY
1826-142752-0049 NO REASON FOR REJECTING THEM HAS APPEARED IF AS MANY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE BELIEVED THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE SCIENCES WERE CAPABLE WHEN DISENGAGED FROM IRRELEVANT DETAIL
1826-142752-0050 OF GIVING US KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE SUCH KNOWLEDGE WOULD HAVE THE SAME CLAIM ON OUR BELIEF AS SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE HAS
1826-142752-0051 OUR RESULT IS IN THE MAIN POSITIVE
1826-142752-0052 WHEN HOWEVER WE SPEAK OF PHILOSOPHY AS A CRITICISM OF KNOWLEDGE IT IS NECESSARY TO IMPOSE A CERTAIN LIMITATION IF WE ADOPT THE ATTITUDE OF THE COMPLETE SCEPTIC PLACING OURSELVES WHOLLY OUTSIDE ALL KNOWLEDGE
1826-142752-0053 AND ASKING FROM THIS OUTSIDE POSITION TO BE COMPELLED TO RETURN WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF KNOWLEDGE WE ARE DEMANDING WHAT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND OUR SCEPTICISM CAN NEVER BE REFUTED FOR ALL REFUTATION MUST BEGIN WITH SOME PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE
1826-142752-0054 WHICH THE DISPUTANTS SHARE FROM BLANK DOUBT NO ARGUMENT CAN BEGIN HENCE THE CRITICISM OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH PHILOSOPHY EMPLOYS MUST NOT BE OF THIS DESTRUCTIVE KIND IF ANY RESULT IS TO BE ACHIEVED
1826-142752-0055 WITH WHICH MODERN PHILOSOPHY BEGAN IS NOT OF THIS KIND BUT IS RATHER THE KIND OF CRITICISM WHICH WE ARE ASSERTING TO BE THE ESSENCE OF PHILOSOPHY HIS METHODICAL DOUBT CONSISTED IN DOUBTING WHATEVER SEEMED DOUBTFUL
1826-142752-0056 SOME KNOWLEDGE SUCH AS KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXISTENCE OF OUR SENSE DATA APPEARS QUITE INDUBITABLE HOWEVER CALMLY AND THOROUGHLY WE REFLECT UPON IT IN REGARD TO SUCH KNOWLEDGE PHILOSOPHICAL CRITICISM DOES NOT REQUIRE
1826-142752-0057 THAT WE SHOULD ABSTAIN FROM BELIEF BUT THERE ARE BELIEFS SUCH FOR EXAMPLE AS THE BELIEF THAT PHYSICAL OBJECTS EXACTLY RESEMBLE OUR SENSE DATA WHICH ARE ENTERTAINED UNTIL WE BEGIN TO REFLECT BUT ARE FOUND TO MELT AWAY WHEN SUBJECTED TO A CLOSE INQUIRY
1826-142752-0058 SUCH BELIEFS PHILOSOPHY WILL BID US REJECT UNLESS SOME NEW LINE OF ARGUMENT IS FOUND TO SUPPORT THEM BUT TO REJECT THE BELIEFS WHICH DO NOT APPEAR OPEN TO ANY OBJECTIONS HOWEVER CLOSELY WE EXAMINE THEM IS NOT REASONABLE
1826-142752-0059 AND IS NOT WHAT PHILOSOPHY ADVOCATES THE CRITICISM AIMED AT IN A WORD IS NOT THAT WHICH WITHOUT REASON DETERMINES TO REJECT
1826-142752-0060 PHILOSOPHY MAY CLAIM JUSTLY THAT IT DIMINISHES THE RISK OF ERROR AND THAT IN SOME CASES IT RENDERS THE RISK SO SMALL AS TO BE PRACTICALLY NEGLIGIBLE TO DO MORE THAN THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE IN A WORLD WHERE MISTAKES MUST OCCUR
1827-143625-0000 WHEN A MAN PRIDES HIMSELF ON BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND INTERPRET THE WRITINGS OF CHRYSIPPUS SAY TO YOURSELF IF CHRYSIPPUS HAD NOT WRITTEN OBSCURELY THIS FELLOW WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING TO BE PROUD OF BUT WHAT IS IT THAT I DESIRE
1827-143625-0001 TO UNDERSTAND NATURE AND TO FOLLOW HER ACCORDINGLY I ASK WHO IS THE INTERPRETER ON HEARING THAT IT IS CHRYSIPPUS I GO TO HIM BUT IT SEEMS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WROTE SO I SEEK ONE TO INTERPRET THAT
1827-143625-0002 SO FAR THERE IS NOTHING TO PRIDE MYSELF ON
1827-143625-0003 THIS ITSELF IS THE ONLY THING TO BE PROUD OF BUT IF I ADMIRE THE INTERPRETATION AND THAT ALONE WHAT ELSE HAVE I TURNED OUT BUT A MERE COMMENTATOR INSTEAD OF A LOVER OF WISDOM EXCEPT INDEED THAT I HAPPEN TO BE INTERPRETING CHRYSIPPUS INSTEAD OF HOMER
1827-143625-0004 SO WHEN ANY ONE SAYS TO ME PRITHEE READ ME CHRYSIPPUS I AM MORE INCLINED TO BLUSH WHEN I CANNOT SHOW MY DEEDS TO BE IN HARMONY AND ACCORDANCE WITH HIS SAYINGS
1827-143625-0005 REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE ENTERTAINING TWO GUESTS BODY AND SOUL WHAT YOU GIVE TO THE BODY YOU PRESENTLY LOSE WHAT YOU GIVE TO THE SOUL YOU KEEP FOR EVER
1827-143625-0006 YOU WHO ARE EATING AND DRINKING BY THOSE WHO DO NEITHER YOU WHO ARE TALKING
1827-143625-0007 NOR ABSTAIN FROM THE THINGS AND THE PLEASURES WE OUGHT TO ABSTAIN FROM SO HE WENT ON
1827-143625-0008 BE WHAT IT MAY THE GOAL APPOINTED ME BRAVELY I'LL FOLLOW NAY AND IF I WOULD NOT I'D PROVE A COWARD YET MUST FOLLOW STILL AGAIN
1827-143625-0009 WHO TO NECESSITY DOTH BOW ARIGHT IS LEARN'D IN WISDOM AND THE THINGS OF GOD
1827-143625-0010 AND THE INTREPIDITY OF ONE WHO HEEDS THEM NOT BUT IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE ELSE WERE HAPPINESS ALSO IMPOSSIBLE WE SHOULD ACT AS WE DO IN SEAFARING WHAT CAN I DO
1827-143625-0011 CHOOSE THE MASTER THE CREW THE DAY THE OPPORTUNITY THEN COMES A SUDDEN STORM WHAT MATTERS IT TO ME MY PART HAS BEEN FULLY DONE THE MATTER IS IN THE HANDS OF ANOTHER THE MASTER OF THE SHIP
1827-143625-0012 THE SHIP IS FOUNDERING WHAT THEN HAVE I TO DO I DO THE ONLY THING THAT REMAINS TO ME TO BE DROWNED WITHOUT FEAR WITHOUT A CRY WITHOUT UPBRAIDING GOD BUT KNOWING THAT WHAT HAS BEEN BORN
1827-143625-0013 MUST LIKEWISE PERISH FOR I AM NOT ETERNITY BUT A HUMAN BEING A PART OF THE WHOLE
1827-143625-0014 FLY COMRADES THE ENEMY ARE UPON US WE SHALL REPLY
1827-143625-0015 WE HAVE BUT ERRED IN SENDING SUCH A SPY AS YOU
1827-143625-0016 HE SAYS THAT DEATH IS NO EVIL FOR IT NEED NOT EVEN BRING SHAME WITH IT HE SAYS THAT FAME IS BUT THE EMPTY NOISE OF MADMEN AND WHAT REPORT DID THIS SPY BRING US OF PAIN WHAT OF PLEASURE WHAT OF WANT
1827-143625-0017 THAT TO BE CLOTHED IN SACKCLOTH IS BETTER THAN ANY PURPLE ROBE THAT SLEEPING ON THE BARE GROUND IS THE SOFTEST COUCH AND IN PROOF OF EACH ASSERTION HE POINTS TO HIS OWN COURAGE CONSTANCY AND FREEDOM
1827-143625-0018 THROUGH REASON WILL NOT THAT SUFFICE HIM WHEN ALONE WHEN HE BEHOLDS AND REFLECTS NOW CAN NO EVIL HAPPEN UNTO ME FOR ME THERE IS NO ROBBER FOR ME NO EARTHQUAKE
1827-143625-0019 ALL THINGS ARE FULL OF PEACE FULL OF TRANQUILLITY NEITHER HIGHWAY NOR CITY NOR GATHERING OF MEN NEITHER NEIGHBOR NOR COMRADE CAN DO ME HURT ANOTHER SUPPLIES MY FOOD WHOSE CARE IT IS
1827-143625-0020 ANOTHER MY RAIMENT ANOTHER HATH GIVEN ME PERCEPTIONS OF SENSE AND PRIMARY CONCEPTIONS AND WHEN HE SUPPLIES MY NECESSITIES NO MORE IT IS THAT HE IS SOUNDING THE RETREAT THAT HE HATH OPENED THE DOOR AND IS SAYING TO THEE
1827-143625-0021 COME WITHER TO NOUGHT THAT THOU NEEDEST FEAR
1827-143625-0022 WHATSOEVER OF FIRE IS IN THEE UNTO FIRE SHALL RETURN WHATSOEVER OF EARTH UNTO EARTH OF SPIRIT UNTO SPIRIT OF WATER UNTO WATER
1827-143625-0023 THERE IS NO HADES NO FABLED RIVERS OF SIGHS OF LAMENTATION OR OF FIRE BUT ALL THINGS ARE FULL OF BEINGS SPIRITUAL AND DIVINE WITH THOUGHTS LIKE THESE
1827-143625-0024 BEHOLDING THE SUN MOON AND STARS ENJOYING EARTH AND SEA A MAN IS NEITHER HELPLESS NOR ALONE
1827-143625-0025 WHAT WOULDST THOU BE FOUND DOING WHEN OVERTAKEN BY DEATH IF I MIGHT CHOOSE I WOULD BE FOUND DOING SOME DEED OF TRUE HUMANITY OF WIDE IMPORT BENEFICENT AND NOBLE
1827-143625-0026 BUT IF I MAY NOT BE FOUND ENGAGED IN AUGHT SO LOFTY
1827-143625-0027 THAT I MAY BE FOUND RAISING UP IN MYSELF THAT WHICH HAD FALLEN LEARNING TO DEAL MORE WISELY WITH THE THINGS OF SENSE WORKING OUT MY OWN TRANQUILLITY AND THUS RENDERING THAT WHICH IS ITS DUE TO EVERY RELATION OF LIFE
1827-143625-0028 IF DEATH SURPRISE ME THUS EMPLOYED IT IS ENOUGH IF I CAN STRETCH FORTH MY HANDS TO GOD AND SAY THE FACULTIES WHICH I RECEIVED AT THY HANDS FOR APPREHENDING THIS THINE ADMINISTRATION I HAVE NOT NEGLECTED
1827-143625-0029 AS FAR AS IN ME LAY I HAVE DONE THEE NO DISHONOUR BEHOLD HOW I HAVE USED THE SENSES THE PRIMARY CONCEPTIONS WHICH THOUS GAVEST ME HAVE I EVER LAID ANYTHING TO THY CHARGE HAVE I EVER MURMURED AT AUGHT THAT CAME TO PASS
1827-143625-0030 OR WISHED IT OTHERWISE HAVE I IN ANYTHING TRANSGRESSED THE RELATIONS OF LIFE FOR THAT THOU DIDST BEGET ME I THANK THEE FOR THAT THOU HAST GIVEN FOR THE TIME DURING WHICH I HAVE USED THE THINGS THAT WERE THINE
1827-143625-0031 IT SUFFICES ME TAKE THEM BACK AND PLACE THEM WHEREVER THOU WILT THEY WERE ALL THINE AND THOU GAVEST THEM ME IF A MAN DEPART THUS MINDED IS IT NOT ENOUGH
1827-143625-0032 WHAT LIFE IS FAIRER AND MORE NOBLE WHAT END HAPPIER THAN HIS APPENDIX A FRAGMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO EPICTETUS
1827-143625-0033 A LIFE ENTANGLED WITH FORTUNE IS LIKE A TORRENT IT IS TURBULENT AND MUDDY HARD TO PASS AND MASTERFUL OF MOOD NOISY AND OF BRIEF CONTINUANCE
1827-143625-0034 THE SOUL THAT COMPANIES WITH VIRTUE IS LIKE AN EVER FLOWING SOURCE IT IS A PURE CLEAR AND WHOLESOME DRAUGHT SWEET RICH AND GENEROUS OF ITS STORE THAT INJURES NOT NEITHER DESTROYS
1827-143625-0035 IT IS A SHAME THAT ONE WHO SWEETENS HIS DRINK WITH THE GIFTS OF THE BEE SHOULD EMBITTER GOD'S GIFT REASON WITH VICE
1827-143625-0036 KEEP NEITHER A BLUNT KNIFE NOR AN ILL DISCIPLINED LOOSENESS OF TONGUE
1827-143625-0037 NATURE HATH GIVEN MEN ONE TONGUE BUT TWO EARS THAT WE MAY HEAR FROM OTHERS TWICE AS MUCH AS WE SPEAK
1827-143625-0038 THINK OF GOD MORE OFTEN THAN THOU BREATHEST
1827-143625-0039 FOR CUSTOM CAN MAKE IT SWEET TO THEE
1827-143625-0040 MAY WELL BE BASED UPON EPICTETEAN SAYINGS
1827-143625-0041 AND MADE HIS VAST BODY OF EXTRACTS FROM MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED AUTHORS FOR HIS SON'S USE
1827-143625-0042 THE ABOVE SELECTION INCLUDES SOME OF DOUBTFUL ORIGIN BUT INTRINSIC INTEREST CROSSLEY APPENDIX B THE HYMN OF CLEANTHES
1827-143625-0043 CHIEFEST GLORY OF DEATHLESS GODS ALMIGHTY FOR EVER SOVEREIGN OF NATURE THAT RULEST BY LAW WHAT NAME SHALL WE GIVE THEE BLESSED BE THOU
1827-143625-0044 FOR ON THEE SHOULD CALL ALL THINGS THAT ARE MORTAL FOR THAT WE ARE THINE OFFSPRING NAY ALL THAT IN MYRIAD MOTION LIVES FOR ITS DAY ON THE EARTH BEARS ONE IMPRESS THY LIKENESS UPON IT
1827-143625-0045 WHEREFORE MY SONG IS OF THEE AND I HYMN THY POWER FOR EVER LO THE VAST ORB OF THE WORLDS ROUND THE EARTH EVERMORE AS IT ROLLETH FEELS THEE ITS RULER AND GUIDE
1827-143625-0046 AND OWNS THY LORDSHIP REJOICING AYE FOR THY CONQUERING HANDS HAVE A SERVANT OF LIVING FIRE SHARP IS THE BOLT WHERE IT FALLS NATURE SHRINKS AT THE SHOCK AND DOTH SHUDDER
1827-143625-0048 HIGH KING THROUGH AGES UNENDING NOUGHT IS DONE THAT IS DONE WITHOUT THEE IN THE EARTH OR THE WATERS OR IN THE HEIGHTS OF HEAVEN SAVE THE DEED OF THE FOOL AND THE SINNER
1827-143625-0049 THOU CANST MAKE ROUGH THINGS SMOOTH AT THY VOICE LO JARRING DISORDER MOVETH TO MUSIC AND LOVE IS BORN WHERE HATRED ABOUNDED THUS HAST THOU FITTED ALIKE THINGS GOOD AND THINGS EVIL TOGETHER
1827-143625-0050 THAT OVER ALL MIGHT REIGN ONE REASON SUPREME AND ETERNAL THOUGH THEREUNTO THE HEARTS OF THE WICKED BE HARDENED AND HEEDLESS WOE UNTO THEM FOR WHILE EVER THEIR HANDS ARE GRASPING AT GOOD THINGS
1827-143625-0051 BLIND ARE THEIR EYES YEA STOPPED ARE THEIR EARS TO GOD'S LAW UNIVERSAL CALLING THROUGH WISE DISOBEDIENCE TO LIVE THE LIFE THAT IS NOBLE THIS THEY MARK NOT BUT HEEDLESS OF RIGHT TURN EACH TO HIS OWN WAY HERE
1827-143625-0052 A HEART FIRED WITH AMBITION IN STRIFE AND STRAINING UNHALLOWED THERE THRUSTING HONOUR ASIDE FAST SET UPON GETTING AND GAINING OTHERS AGAIN GIVEN OVER TO LUSTS AND DISSOLUTE SOFTNESS
1827-143625-0053 WORKING NEVER GOD'S LAW BUT THAT WHICH WARETH UPON IT NAY BUT O GIVER OF ALL THINGS GOOD WHOSE HOME IS THE DARK CLOUD THOU THAT WIELDS HEAVEN'S BOLT SAVE MEN FROM THEIR IGNORANCE GRIEVOUS
1827-143625-0054 WHEREWITHAL SISTERED WITH JUSTICE THOU RULEST AND GOVERNEST ALL THINGS THAT WE HONOURED BY THEE MAY REQUITE THEE WITH WORSHIP AND HONOUR EVERMORE PRAISING THY WORKS
1827-143625-0055 AS IS MEET FOR MEN THAT SHALL PERISH SEEING THAT NONE
1845-145083-0000 THE MILES HOME STILL KNOWN IN HAMILTON AS THE HACKETT PLACE SINCE IT HAD BEEN BUILT MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS BEFORE BY FLORA'S FATHER OLD SILAS HACKETT DEAD THESE SEVEN YEARS
1845-145083-0001 DOMINATED ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THE WOODED HILLS WHICH ENCIRCLED MIRROR LAKE IN THE BRENTWOOD SECTION OF MODIFIED TUDOR ARCHITECTURE ITS DEEP RED MELLOWED BRICKS HAD ACHIEVED IN THREE DECADES
1845-145083-0002 ON SUNDAY THE DAY AFTER NITA SELIM'S MURDER WHEN HE HAD COME TO INTERVIEW LYDIA CARR AND HAD SECURED THE ALIBI WHICH HAD ELIMINATED DEXTER SPRAGUE AS A SUSPECT DUNDEE HAD DRIVEN HIS CAR UP THIS HILL BETWEEN THE TALL YEW HEDGES
1845-145083-0003 HAD DESCENDED THE KITCHEN STAIRS WITH LYDIA TO THE SERVANTS SITTING ROOM IN THE BASEMENT NOW HE CONTINUED ALONG THE MAIN DRIVEWAY TO THE MORE IMPRESSIVE ENTRANCE WHOSE FLANKING SLIM TURRETS FROWNED DOWN UPON A LINE OF POLICE CARS AND MOTORCYCLES
1845-145083-0004 THE DETECTIVE'S FIRST GLANCE TOOK IN STATELY ARMCHAIRS OF THE CROMWELL PERIOD THICK MELLOW TONED RUGS AND IN THE LIVING ROOM BEYOND SPLENDID EXAMPLES OF JACOBEAN FURNITURE
1845-145083-0005 A HORRIBLE THING TO HAPPEN IN A MAN'S HOME DUNDEE MILES WAS SAYING HIS PLUMP ROSY FACE BLIGHTED WITH HORROR I CAN'T REALIZE YET THAT WE ACTUALLY SLEPT AS USUAL WITH A CORPSE LYING DOWN HERE ALL NIGHT AND I HAVE ONLY MYSELF TO BLAME
1845-145083-0006 WHAT DO YOU MEAN DUNDEE ASKED WHY THAT THE THE BODY WASN'T DISCOVERED SOONER MILES EXPLAINED IF IT HAD OCCURRED TO ME THAT WHITSON HADN'T CLOSED THE TROPHY ROOM WINDOWS I SHOULD HAVE GONE IN TO CLOSE AND LOCK THEM WHEN I MADE THE ROUNDS OF LIVING ROOM
1845-145083-0007 DINING ROOM AND LIBRARY AFTER OUR GUESTS WERE GONE LAST NIGHT A PALE FACED BALD HEADED BUTLER HAD MATERIALIZED WHILE HIS MASTER WAS SPEAKING BEG PARDON SIR
1845-145083-0008 BUT I DID NOT CLOSE THE TROPHY ROOM WINDOWS BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE USING THE ROOM AGAIN YOU SEE SIR AND WHITSON TURNED TO DUNDEE MISTER MILES AND MISTER DUNLAP PLAYED PING PONG IN THE TROPHY ROOM AFTER DINNER UNTIL THE OTHER GUESTS BEGAN TO ARRIVE
1845-145083-0009 EXCEPT SPRAGUE OF COURSE AND I HAD NO IDEA HE'D GONE THERE DRAKE WANTED TO PLAY ANAGRAMS AND BEFORE THE BRIDGE GAME STARTED I WENT TO THE TROPHY ROOM TO GET THE BOX MILES EXPLAINED I TURNED OFF THE LIGHT WHEN I LEFT
1845-145083-0010 AND THERE WAS NO LIGHT BURNING IN THERE THIS MORNING WHEN CELIA THE PARLOR MAID WENT THERE TO PUT THE ANAGRAM BOX BACK IN THE CABINET AND FOUND THE BODY FLORA MISSUS MILES HAD BROUGHT THE ANAGRAMS IN FROM THE PORCH AND LEFT THEM ON A TABLE IN THE LIVING ROOM
1845-145083-0011 AS OUR GUESTS WERE GETTING READY TO LEAVE THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO BRING IN IN CASE OF RAIN THE BRIDGE TABLES ARE OF IRON COVERED WITH OILCLOTH AND FITTED WITH OILCLOTH BAGS FOR THE CARDS SCORE PADS AND PENCILS YES I KNOW DUNDEE INTERRUPTED
1845-145083-0012 MISS CRAIN HAS ALREADY TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THAT AND A GOOD MANY DETAILS OF THE PARTY ITSELF BY THE WAY WHERE IS MISSUS MILES NOW IN BED THE DOCTOR IS WITH HER SHE IS PROSTRATED FROM THE SHOCK
1845-145083-0013 NO DON'T BOTHER TO COME WITH ME JUST POINT IT OUT IT'S ON THIS FLOOR I UNDERSTAND MILES POINTED PAST THE GREAT CIRCULAR STAIRCASE THAT WOUND UPWARD FROM THE MAIN HALL YOU CAN'T SEE THE DOOR FROM HERE BUT IT'S BEHIND THE STAIRCASE
1845-145083-0014 CELIA FOUND THE DOOR CLOSED THIS MORNING AND NO LIGHT ON AS I SAID DUNDEE CUT HIM SHORT BY MARCHING TOWARD THE DOOR WHICH WAS AGAIN CLOSED HE ENTERED SO NOISELESSLY THAT CAPTAIN STRAWN DOCTOR PRICE AND THE FINGERPRINT EXPERT CARRAWAY DID NOT HEAR HIM
1845-145083-0015 FOR A MOMENT HE STOOD JUST INSIDE THE DOOR AND LET HIS EYES WANDER ABOUT THE ROOM WHICH PENNY CRAIN HAD ALREADY DESCRIBED IT WAS NOT A LARGE ROOM TWELVE BY FOURTEEN FEET POSSIBLY BUT IT LOOKED EVEN SMALLER CROWDED AS IT WAS WITH THE LONG PING PONG TABLE
1845-145083-0016 BAGS OF GOLF CLUBS FISHING TACKLE TENNIS RACQUETS SKIS AND SLEDS THERE WERE TWO WINDOWS IN THE NORTH WALL OF THE ROOM LOOKING OUT UPON THE YEW HEDGED DRIVEWAY AND BETWEEN THEM STOOD A CABINET OF NUMEROUS BIG AND LITTLE DRAWERS
1845-145083-0017 A POOL OF WHICH HAD FORMED AND THEN HALF CONGEALED UPON THE RUG THE RIGHT HAND THE FINGERS CURLED BUT NOT TOUCHING EACH OTHER LAY PALM UPWARD ON THE FLOOR AT THE END OF THE RIGID OUTSTRETCHED ARM THE ONE VISIBLE EYE WAS HALF OPEN
1845-145083-0018 BUT ON THE SALLOW THIN FACE WHICH HAD BEEN STRIKINGLY HANDSOME IN AN OBVIOUS SORT OF WAY WAS A PEACE AND DIGNITY WHICH DUNDEE HAD NEVER SEEN UPON SPRAGUE'S FACE WHEN THE MAN WAS ALIVE THE LEFT LEG WAS DRAWN UPWARD SO THAT THE KNEE ALMOST TOUCHED THE BULLET PIERCED STOMACH
1845-145083-0019 HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN DEAD DOCTOR DUNDEE ASKED QUIETLY HELLO BOY DOCTOR PRICE GREETED HIM PLACIDLY ALWAYS THE SAME QUESTION I'VE BEEN HERE ONLY A FEW MINUTES AND I'VE ALREADY TOLD STRAWN THAT I SHALL PROBABLY BE UNABLE TO FIX THE HOUR OF DEATH
1845-145083-0020 WITH ANY DEGREE OF ACCURACY TOOK YOUR TIME DIDN'T YOU BONNIE CAPTAIN STRAWN GREETED HIS FORMER SUBORDINATE ON THE HOMICIDE SQUAD DOC SAYS HE'S BEEN DEAD BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE HOURS SINCE IT'S NEARLY TEN NOW
1845-145083-0021 THAT MEANS SPRAGUE WAS KILLED SOME TIME BETWEEN NINE AND ELEVEN O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT BETTER SAY BETWEEN NINE O'CLOCK AND MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT DOCTOR PRICE SUGGESTED HE MAY HAVE LIVED AN HOUR OR MORE UNCONSCIOUS OF COURSE
1845-145083-0022 FOR THE INDICATIONS ARE THAT HE DID NOT DIE INSTANTLY BUT STAGGERED A FEW STEPS CLUTCHING AT THE WOUND BUT OF COURSE I SHALL HAVE TO PERFORM AN AUTOPSY FIRST DUNDEE CROSSED THE ROOM STEPPING OVER THE DEAD MAN'S STICK
1845-145083-0023 A SWANK AFFAIR OF DARK POLISHED WOOD WITH A HEAVY KNOB OF CARVED ONYX WHICH LAY ABOUT A FOOT BEYOND THE REACH OF THE CURLED FINGERS OF THE STIFF RIGHT HAND SPRAGUE'S HAT HE ASKED POINTING TO A BRIGHTLY BANDED STRAW WHICH LAY UPON THE TOP OF THE CABINET
1845-145083-0024 YES STRAWN ANSWERED AND DID YOU NOTICE THE WINDOW SCREEN HE POINTED TO THE WINDOW IN FRONT OF WHICH THE BODY LAY THE SASH OF LEADED PANES WAS RAISED AS HIGH AS IT WOULD GO AND BENEATH IT WAS A SCREEN OF THE ROLLER CURTAIN TYPE
1845-145083-0025 AND STRAWN BEGAN EAGERLY YOU'LL HAVE TO ADMIT I WAS RIGHT NOW BOY YOU'VE SNEERED AT MY GUNMAN THEORY AND TRIED TO PIN NITA'S MURDER ON ONE OF HAMILTON'S FINEST BUNCH OF PEOPLE BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO ADMIT NOW THAT EVERY DETAIL OF THIS SET UP BEARS ME OUT YES
1845-145083-0026 AND I HAVE MILES WORD FOR IT AIN'T ANY TOO GLAD TO SEE HIM AND SHOWS IT HE PHONES FOR A TAXI TO GO BACK TO HIS HOTEL ABOUT NINE FIFTEEN THAT WAS MILES SAYS BUT DECIDES TO WALK DOWN THE HILL TO MEET IT
1845-145083-0027 DON'T WANT TO GO BACK OUT ON THE PORCH AND LIE ABOUT HAVING HAD A GOOD TIME WHEN HE HASN'T WELL HE OPENS THE FRONT DOOR OR WHAT WOULD BE THE FRONT DOOR IF THIS WAS ANY ORDINARY HOUSE BUT BEFORE HE STEPS OUT HE SEES OR HEARS SOMETHING
1845-145083-0028 PROBABLY A RUSTLING IN THE HEDGE ACROSS THE DRIVEWAY OR MAYBE HE EVEN SEES A FACE IN THE LIGHT FROM THE LANTERNS ON EACH SIDE OF THE DOOR HE FEELS SURE NITA'S MURDERER HAS TRAILED HIM AND IS LYING IN WAIT FOR HIM IN A PANIC HE DARTS INTO THIS ROOM
1845-145083-0029 I'VE GOT MILES WORD FOR IT THAT NEITHER HE NOR ANYBODY ELSE HEARD A SHOT OF COURSE NOBODY KNEW SPRAGUE WAS IN HERE AND SINCE HIS HAT AND STICK WAS BOTH MISSING FROM THE HALL CLOSET THEY TOOK IT FOR GRANTED HE'D BEAT IT ANY OBJECTIONS TO THAT THEORY BOY
1845-145083-0030 JUST A FEW ONE IN PARTICULAR DUNDEE SAID BUT I GRANT IT'S A GOOD ONE PROVIDED DOCTOR PRICE'S AUTOPSY BEARS YOU OUT AS TO THE COURSE OF THE BULLET AND THAT CARRAWAY FINDS SPRAGUE'S FINGERPRINTS ON THAT CONTRIVANCE FOR RAISING THE SCREEN EVEN THEN
1845-145083-0031 BUT DUNDEE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO FINISH HIS SENTENCE FOR STRAWN WAS SUMMONED TO THE TELEPHONE BY WHITSON WHEN HE RETURNED THERE WAS A SLIGHTLY BEWILDERED LOOK ON HIS HEAVY OLD FACE THAT'S FUNNY COLLINS THE LAD I SENT TO CHECK UP ON THE TAXI COMPANIES
1845-145083-0032 SAYS HE'S LOCATED THE DRIVER THAT ANSWERED SPRAGUE'S CALL LAST NIGHT THE DRIVER SAYS HE WAS CALLED ABOUT NINE FIFTEEN TOLD TO COME IMMEDIATELY AND TO WAIT FOR SPRAGUE AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL ON THE MAIN ROAD
1845-145088-0000 DUNDEE LAUGHED THE PARROT WHICH HAD SAVED HIS LIFE ECHOING HIS MIRTH RAUCOUSLY AS HIS EYES HIT UPON THE FOLLOWING LINES OF FINE PRINT
1845-145088-0001 OF WHO'S WHO IN AMERICA BURNS WILLIAM JOHN DETECTIVE
1845-145088-0002 BALTIMORE OCTOBER NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE A TAUNT AND A JOKE WHICH TURNED SOUR MY DEAR WATSON HE EXULTED TO THE PARROT A JOKE I WAS NOT INTENDED TO LIVE TO LAUGH OVER HE CLOSED THE BOOK AND REPLACED IT IN THE BOOKCASE
1845-145088-0003 CARELESS OF FINGERPRINTS FOR HE WAS SURE THE MURDERER HAD BEEN TOO CLEVER TO LEAVE ANY BEHIND HIM IN THAT ROOM OR UPON THE GUN AND SILENCER EITHER FOR THAT MATTER INTERESTEDLY DUNDEE SURVEYED THE SCENE OF HIS ATTEMPTED MURDER
1845-145088-0004 JUST AS THERE HAD BEEN ON DEXTER SPRAGUE'S
1845-145088-0005 ON DUNDEE'S OWN TYPEWRITER AND STATIONERY STRAWN MIGHT EVEN HAVE GOT A MOURNFUL SORT OF AMUSEMENT OUT OF THE FACT THAT DUNDEE HAD BEEN ADVISED TO CALL UPON A GREATER DETECTIVE THAN HIMSELF FOR ASSISTANCE YES INGENIOUS INDEED
1845-145088-0006 AND SO AMAZINGLY SIMPLE SUDDENLY THE YOUNG DETECTIVE SNATCHED FOR HIS HAT IF THE MURDERER WAS SO INGENIOUS IN THIS CASE MIGHT HE NOT HAVE BEEN EQUALLY CLEVER IN PLANNING AND EXECUTING THE MURDER OF NITA LEIGH SELIM
1845-145088-0007 TWENTY MINUTES LATER HE PARKED HIS CAR IN THE RUTTY ROAD BEFORE THE SELIM HOUSE IN PRIMROSE MEADOWS AND HONKED HIS HORN LOUDLY TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE PLAINCLOTHESMEN CAPTAIN STRAWN HAD DETAILED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MURDER
1845-145088-0008 WITH WHICH THE FRONT DOOR WAS EQUIPPED STRAIGHT DOWN THE MAIN HALL HE WENT AND INTO THE LITTLE FOYER BETWEEN THE HALL AND NITA'S BEDROOM HE SNATCHED UP THE TELEPHONE AND TO HIS RELIEF IT WAS NOT DEAD HE GAVE THE NUMBER OF CAPTAIN STRAWN'S HOME AND HAD THE PLEASURE OF LEARNING THAT HE HAD
1845-145088-0009 INTERRUPTED HIS FORMER CHIEF AT A LATE SUNDAY BREAKFAST WHEN DID YOU WITHDRAW THE GUARD FROM THE SELIM HOUSE HE ASKED ABRUPTLY CUTTING SHORT STRAWN'S CORDIAL WELCOME HOME LATE THURSDAY AFTERNOON THE CHIEF OF THE HOMICIDE SQUAD ANSWERED BELLIGERENTLY
1845-145088-0010 NO USE TO EXPLAIN NOW TO STRAWN THAT THE MURDERER HAD BEEN GIVEN EVERY CHANCE TO REMOVE ANY BETRAYING TRACES OF HIS CRIME BESIDES HIS FIRST EXCITED HUNCH AFTER HIS OWN ATTEMPTED MURDER MIGHT VERY WELL BE A WILD GROUNDLESS ONE
1845-145088-0011 IN HIS DUNDEE'S CASE THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE MURDER'S BEING DELAYED OR ARRANGED SO THAT THE DETECTIVE MIGHT BE SLAIN WHEN THE WHOLE CROWD WAS ASSEMBLED WAS OBVIOUS THE MURDERER HAD READ IN A LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON EXTRA
1845-145088-0012 A COPY OF WHICH WAS NOW IN DUNDEE'S POCKET DISTRICT ATTORNEY SANDERSON'S BOAST TO THE PRESS THAT HIS OFFICE HAD BEEN WORKING ON AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THEORY THAN THAT WHICH CONNECTED THE TWO MURDERS WITH SWALLOW TAIL SAMMY
1845-145088-0013 THAT SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR DUNDEE EXPECTED BACK IN HAMILTON EARLY SUNDAY MORNING HAD BEEN INVESTIGATING NITA LEIGH'S PAST LIFE IN NEW YORK AND DESPITE DUNDEE'S TELEGRAPHED WARNING HE HAD HINTED SENSATIONAL REVELATIONS CONNECTED WITH THE TWELVE YEAR OLD
1845-145088-0014 ROYAL BLUE VELVET DRESS WHICH NITA HAD CHOSEN TO BE HER SHROUD AND IN HIS DESIRE TO REASSURE THE PUBLIC THROUGH THE PRESS SANDERSON HAD MYSTERIOUSLY PROMISED EVEN MORE SPECIFIC REVELATIONS THAN DUNDEE HAD ACTUALLY BROUGHT HOME WITH HIM
1845-145088-0015 PRODDED BY REPORTERS SANDERSON HAD ADMITTED THAT HE DID NOT HIMSELF KNOW THE NATURE OF THOSE REVELATIONS THE EXASPERATED YOUNG DETECTIVE COULD PICTURE THE MURDERER READING THOSE SENSATIONAL HINTS AND PROMISES
1845-145088-0016 THE NEED FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION SO THAT SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR DUNDEE SHOULD NOT LIVE TO TELL THE TALE OF HIS NEW YORK DISCOVERIES TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR ANYONE ELSE BUT WHETHER HE WAS RIGHT OR WRONG DUNDEE DETERMINED TO GIVE HIS HUNCH A CHANCE
1845-145088-0017 SHOT THROUGH THE BACK AS SHE SAT AT HER DRESSING TABLE POWDERING HER FACE IF HER MURDER HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY MECHANICAL MEANS HOW HAD IT BEEN DONE THERE WAS NO HOT AIR REGISTER HERE FROM THE DRESSING TABLE DUNDEE WALKED TO THE WINDOW
1845-145088-0018 UPON WHOSE PALE GREEN FRAME THERE WAS STILL THE TINY PENCIL MARK WHICH DOCTOR PRICE HAD DRAWN TO INDICATE THE END OF THE PATH ALONG WHICH THE BULLET HAD TRAVELED PROVIDED IT HAD TRAVELED SO FAR NOTHING HERE TO AID IN A MECHANICAL MURDER
1845-145088-0019 BUT IN A FLASH DUNDEE CHANGED HIS MIND FOR JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE PENCIL MARK THERE WAS A SMALL DENT IN THE SOFT PAINTED PINE OF THE WINDOW FRAME AND BEFORE HIS MIND COULD FRAME WORDS AND SENTENCES
1845-145088-0020 NOTHING HERE NOT NOW BECAUSE HE HIMSELF HAD TAKEN THE LAMP TO THE COURTHOUSE FOR SAFE KEEPING HE SAW IT CLEARLY IN IMAGINATION THAT BRONZE FLOOR LAMP
1845-145088-0021 WHICH FLORA MILES HAD DESCRIBED ONE OF THE BIG GLASS JEWELS HAD BEEN MISSING LEAVING AN UNSIGHTLY HOLE
1845-145088-0022 FOR IF HIS HUNCH WAS CORRECT THE GUN WEDGED INTO THE BIG BOWL WITH THE SILENCER SLIGHTLY PROTRUDING FROM THE JEWEL HOLE HAD KICKED JUST AS IT HAD KICKED AN HOUR BEFORE WHEN IT HAD DISLODGED ITSELF FROM THE HOLE IN THE HOT AIR REGISTER
1845-145088-0023 AND CLATTERED DOWN THE BIG PIPE TO THE HEAT RESERVOIR OF THE FURNACE THAT THE BIG LAMP WHEN HE FOLLOWING STRAWN HAD FIRST EXAMINED THE SCENE OF NITA'S MURDER HAD NOT STOOD IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW FRAME DID NOT DAMPEN DUNDEE'S EXCITEMENT IN THE LEAST
1845-145088-0024 AFTER KAREN MARSHALL'S SCREAM THAT ROOM HAD BEEN FILLED WITH EXCITED PEOPLE WHO HAD RUSHED ABOUT LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW FOR THE MURDERER AND DOING ALL THE OTHER THINGS WHICH TERROR STRICKEN PEOPLE DO IN SUCH A CRISIS NO THE MURDERER OR MURDERESS
1845-145088-0025 TO THE PLACE IT HAD ALWAYS OCCUPIED BEFORE BUT HOW HAD THE GUN BEEN FIRED FROM THE LAMP ELECTRICALLY ANOTHER PICTURE FLASHED INTO DUNDEE'S MIND HE SAW HIMSELF STOOPING ON MONDAY AFTERNOON
1845-145088-0026 TO SEE IF THE PLUG OF THE LAMP'S CORD HAD BEEN PULLED FROM THE SOCKET SAW IT AGAIN AS IT WAS THEN NEARLY OUT SO THAT NO CURRENT COULD PASS FROM THE BASEBOARD OUTLET UNDER THE BOOKCASE INTO THE BRONZE LAMP
1845-145088-0027 HOW FAR FROM THE TRUTH HIS CONCLUSION THAT MONDAY HAD BEEN BUT WHAT WAS THE REAL TRUTH SUDDENLY DUNDEE FLUNG BACK THE MOSS GREEN WILTON RUG WHICH ALMOST ENTIRELY COVERED THE BEDROOM FLOOR AND REVEALED THE BELL WHICH DEXTER SPRAGUE
1845-145088-0028 HAD RIGGED UP SO THAT NITA MIGHT SUMMON LYDIA FROM HER BASEMENT ROOM IN CASE OF DIRE NEED A PRECAUTION WITH WHICH THE MURDERER WAS PROBABLY FAMILIAR SINCE LOIS DUNLAP MIGHT INNOCENTLY HAVE SPREAD THE NEWS OF ITS EXISTENCE
1845-145088-0029 THERE WAS A HALF INCH HOLE IN THE HARDWOOD FLOOR AND OUT OF IT ISSUED A LENGTH OF GREEN ELECTRIC CORD CONNECTED WITH TWO SMALL FLAT METAL PLATES ONE UPON THE OTHER SO THAT WHEN STEPPED UPON A BELL WOULD RING IN LYDIA'S BASEMENT ROOM
1845-145088-0030 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD ABOUT THE WIRE ALTHOUGH IT WAS OBVIOUSLY NEW A SECTION OF IT NEAR THE TWO METAL PLATES WAS WRAPPED WITH BLACK ADHESIVE TAPE ANOTHER MEMORY KNOCKED FOR ATTENTION UPON DUNDEE'S MIND THE LONG CORD OF THE BRONZE LAMP
1845-145088-0031 HAD BEEN MENDED WITH EXACTLY THE SAME SORT OF TAPE ABOUT A FOOT FROM WHERE IT ENDED IN THE CONTACT PLUG WITHIN ANOTHER TWO MINUTES DUNDEE WITH A FLASHLIGHT HE HAD FOUND IN THE KITCHEN WAS EXPLORING THE DARK EARTHY PORTION OF THE BASEMENT
1845-145088-0032 INTO LYDIA'S ROOM HE WAS TOO LATE THANKS TO CAPTAIN STRAWN THE BELL WHICH SPRAGUE HAD RIGGED UP WAS IN WORKING ORDER AGAIN BUT AS HE WAS PASSING OUT OF THE BASEMENT HE GLANCED AT THE CEILING OF THE LARGE ROOM DEVOTED TO FURNACE
1845-145088-0033 HOT WATER HEATER AND LAUNDRY TUBS AND IN THE CEILING HE SAW A HOLE THE MURDERER HAD LEFT A TRACE HE COULD NOT OBLITERATE AT THREE O'CLOCK THAT SUNDAY AFTERNOON BONNIE DUNDEE FATIGUED AFTER A STRENUOUS DAY
1845-145088-0034 AND SUFFERING TO HIS OWN SOMEWHAT DISGUSTED AMUSEMENT FROM REACTION EVEN A DETECTIVE FEELS SOME SHOCK AT HAVING NARROWLY ESCAPED DEATH
1845-145088-0035 PLAYING ANAGRAMS AFTER GREETING HIM MISSUS CRAIN ROSE TO SURRENDER HER PLACE TO THE VISITOR YOU PLAY WITH THIS GIRL OF MINE MISTER DUNDEE SHE'S TOO CLEVER FOR ME SHE'S BEATEN ME EVERY GAME SO FAR
1845-145088-0036 BECAUSE I WANTED TO FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW NITA SELIM WAS KILLED AND I DID DUNDEE ANSWERED I WISH I KNEW AS WELL WHO MURDERED HER MUTE BEFORE PENNY'S EXCITED QUESTIONS THE DETECTIVE IDLY SELECTED LETTERS FROM THE MASS
1845-145088-0037 OF FACE UP BLOCKS ON THE TABLE AND SPELLED OUT IN A LONG ROW THE NAMES OF ALL THE GUESTS AT NITA'S FATAL BRIDGE PARTY SUDDENLY AND WITH A CRY THAT STARTLED PENNY DUNDEE MADE A NEW NAME WITH THE LITTLE WOODEN LETTERS
1845-147962-0000 THE FIRST SNOWFALL CAME EARLY IN DECEMBER I REMEMBER HOW THE WORLD LOOKED FROM OUR SITTING ROOM WINDOW AS I DRESSED BEHIND THE STOVE THAT MORNING THE LOW SKY WAS LIKE A SHEET OF METAL THE BLOND CORNFIELDS HAD FADED OUT INTO GHOSTLINESS AT LAST
1845-147962-0001 THE LITTLE POND WAS FROZEN UNDER ITS STIFF WILLOW BUSHES BIG WHITE FLAKES WERE WHIRLING OVER EVERYTHING AND DISAPPEARING IN THE RED GRASS BEYOND THE POND ON THE SLOPE THAT CLIMBED TO THE CORNFIELD THERE WAS FAINTLY MARKED IN THE GRASS
1845-147962-0002 WHENEVER ONE LOOKED AT THIS SLOPE AGAINST THE SETTING SUN THE CIRCLE SHOWED LIKE A PATTERN IN THE GRASS AND THIS MORNING WHEN THE FIRST LIGHT SPRAY OF SNOW LAY OVER IT IT CAME OUT WITH WONDERFUL DISTINCTNESS LIKE STROKES OF CHINESE WHITE ON CANVAS
1845-147962-0003 AND SEEMED A GOOD OMEN FOR THE WINTER AS SOON AS THE SNOW HAD PACKED HARD I BEGAN TO DRIVE ABOUT THE COUNTRY IN A CLUMSY SLEIGH THAT OTTO FUCHS MADE FOR ME BY FASTENING A WOODEN GOODS BOX ON BOBS
1845-147962-0004 IT WAS A BRIGHT COLD DAY I PILED STRAW AND BUFFALO ROBES INTO THE BOX AND TOOK TWO HOT BRICKS WRAPPED IN OLD BLANKETS WHEN I GOT TO THE SHIMERDAS I DID NOT GO UP TO THE HOUSE
1845-147962-0005 BUT SAT IN MY SLEIGH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRAW AND CALLED ANTONIA AND YULKA CAME RUNNING OUT WEARING LITTLE RABBIT SKIN HATS THEIR FATHER HAD MADE FOR THEM THEY HAD HEARD ABOUT MY SLEDGE FROM AMBROSCH AND KNEW WHY I HAD COME
1845-147962-0006 THEY TUMBLED IN BESIDE ME AND WE SET OFF TOWARD THE NORTH ALONG A ROAD THAT HAPPENED TO BE BROKEN THE SKY WAS BRILLIANTLY BLUE AND THE SUNLIGHT ON THE GLITTERING WHITE STRETCHES OF PRAIRIE WAS ALMOST BLINDING AS ANTONIA SAID
1845-147962-0007 THE WHOLE WORLD WAS CHANGED BY THE SNOW WE KEPT LOOKING IN VAIN FOR FAMILIAR LANDMARKS THE DEEP ARROYO THROUGH WHICH SQUAW CREEK WOUND WAS NOW ONLY A CLEFT BETWEEN SNOW DRIFTS VERY BLUE WHEN ONE LOOKED DOWN INTO IT
1845-147962-0008 THE TREE TOPS THAT HAD BEEN GOLD ALL THE AUTUMN WERE DWARFED AND TWISTED AS IF THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE ANY LIFE IN THEM AGAIN THE FEW LITTLE CEDARS WHICH WERE SO DULL AND DINGY BEFORE NOW STOOD OUT A STRONG DUSKY GREEN
1845-147962-0009 THE WIND HAD THE BURNING TASTE OF FRESH SNOW MY THROAT AND NOSTRILS SMARTED AS IF SOME ONE HAD OPENED A HARTSHORN BOTTLE THE COLD STUNG AND AT THE SAME TIME DELIGHTED ONE MY HORSE'S BREATH ROSE LIKE STEAM
1845-147962-0010 AND WHENEVER WE STOPPED HE SMOKED ALL OVER THE CORNFIELDS GOT BACK A LITTLE OF THEIR COLOR UNDER THE DAZZLING LIGHT AND STOOD THE PALEST POSSIBLE GOLD IN THE SUN AND SNOW ALL ABOUT US THE SNOW WAS CRUSTED IN SHALLOW TERRACES
1845-147962-0011 WITH TRACINGS LIKE RIPPLE MARKS AT THE EDGES CURLY WAVES THAT WERE THE ACTUAL IMPRESSION OF THE STINGING LASH IN THE WIND THE GIRLS HAD ON COTTON DRESSES UNDER THEIR SHAWLS THEY KEPT SHIVERING BENEATH THE BUFFALO ROBES AND HUGGING EACH OTHER FOR WARMTH
1845-147962-0012 BUT THEY WERE SO GLAD TO GET AWAY FROM THEIR UGLY CAVE AND THEIR MOTHER'S SCOLDING THAT THEY BEGGED ME TO GO ON AND ON AS FAR AS RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE THE GREAT FRESH OPEN AFTER THE STUPEFYING WARMTH INDOORS MADE THEM BEHAVE LIKE WILD THINGS
1845-147962-0013 THEY LAUGHED AND SHOUTED AND SAID THEY NEVER WANTED TO GO HOME AGAIN COULD N'T WE SETTLE DOWN AND LIVE IN RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE YULKA ASKED AND COULD N'T I GO TO TOWN AND BUY THINGS FOR US TO KEEP HOUSE WITH ALL THE WAY TO RUSSIAN PETER'S WE WERE EXTRAVAGANTLY HAPPY
1845-147962-0014 BUT WHEN WE TURNED BACK IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK THE EAST WIND GREW STRONGER AND BEGAN TO HOWL THE SUN LOST ITS HEARTENING POWER AND THE SKY BECAME GRAY AND SOMBER I TOOK OFF MY LONG WOOLEN COMFORTER AND WOUND IT AROUND YULKA'S THROAT
1845-147962-0016 WHICH KEPT ME IN THE HOUSE FOR NEARLY TWO WEEKS THE BASEMENT KITCHEN SEEMED HEAVENLY SAFE AND WARM IN THOSE DAYS LIKE A TIGHT LITTLE BOAT IN A WINTER SEA THE MEN WERE OUT IN THE FIELDS ALL DAY HUSKING CORN AND WHEN THEY CAME IN AT NOON
1845-147962-0017 WITH LONG CAPS PULLED DOWN OVER THEIR EARS AND THEIR FEET IN RED LINED OVERSHOES I USED TO THINK THEY WERE LIKE ARCTIC EXPLORERS IN THE AFTERNOONS WHEN GRANDMOTHER SAT UPSTAIRS DARNING OR MAKING HUSKING GLOVES
1845-147962-0018 I READ THE SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON ALOUD TO HER AND I FELT THAT THE SWISS FAMILY HAD NO ADVANTAGES OVER US IN THE WAY OF AN ADVENTUROUS LIFE I WAS CONVINCED THAT MAN'S STRONGEST ANTAGONIST IS THE COLD
1845-147962-0019 I ADMIRED THE CHEERFUL ZEST WITH WHICH GRANDMOTHER WENT ABOUT KEEPING US WARM AND COMFORTABLE AND WELL FED SHE OFTEN REMINDED ME WHEN SHE WAS PREPARING FOR THE RETURN OF THE HUNGRY MEN THAT THIS COUNTRY WAS NOT LIKE VIRGINIA AND THAT HERE A COOK HAD
1845-147962-0020 STRIPED WITH CURRANTS AND BOILED IN A BAG NEXT TO GETTING WARM AND KEEPING WARM DINNER AND SUPPER WERE THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS WE HAD TO THINK ABOUT OUR LIVES CENTERED AROUND WARMTH AND FOOD AND THE RETURN OF THE MEN AT NIGHTFALL
1845-147962-0021 I USED TO WONDER WHEN THEY CAME IN TIRED FROM THE FIELDS THEIR FEET NUMB AND THEIR HANDS CRACKED AND SORE HOW THEY COULD DO ALL THE CHORES SO CONSCIENTIOUSLY FEED AND WATER AND BED THE HORSES MILK THE COWS AND LOOK AFTER THE PIGS
1845-147962-0022 WHEN SUPPER WAS OVER IT TOOK THEM A LONG WHILE TO GET THE COLD OUT OF THEIR BONES WHILE GRANDMOTHER AND I WASHED THE DISHES AND GRANDFATHER READ HIS PAPER UPSTAIRS JAKE AND OTTO SAT ON THE LONG BENCH BEHIND THE STOVE EASING THEIR INSIDE BOOTS
1845-147962-0023 OR RUBBING MUTTON TALLOW INTO THEIR CRACKED HANDS EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT WE POPPED CORN OR MADE TAFFY AND OTTO FUCHS USED TO SING FOR I AM A COWBOY AND KNOW I'VE DONE WRONG OR BURY ME NOT ON THE LONE PRAIREE
1845-147962-0024 AND JAKE'S SHAGGY HAIR SLICKED FLAT IN FRONT BY A WET COMB I CAN SEE THE SAG OF THEIR TIRED SHOULDERS AGAINST THE WHITEWASHED WALL WHAT GOOD FELLOWS THEY WERE HOW MUCH THEY KNEW AND HOW MANY THINGS THEY HAD KEPT FAITH WITH
1845-147962-0025 FUCHS HAD BEEN A COWBOY A STAGE DRIVER A BAR TENDER A MINER HAD WANDERED ALL OVER THAT GREAT WESTERN COUNTRY AND DONE HARD WORK EVERYWHERE THOUGH AS GRANDMOTHER SAID HE HAD NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT JAKE WAS DULLER THAN OTTO
1845-147962-0026 IT WAS A MATTER OF PRIDE WITH THEM NOT TO SPARE THEMSELVES YET THEY WERE THE SORT OF MEN WHO NEVER GET ON SOMEHOW OR DO ANYTHING BUT WORK HARD FOR A DOLLAR OR TWO A DAY ON THOSE BITTER STARLIT NIGHTS
1845-147962-0027 AS WE SAT AROUND THE OLD STOVE THAT FED US AND WARMED US AND KEPT US CHEERFUL WE COULD HEAR THE COYOTES HOWLING DOWN BY THE CORRALS AND THEIR HUNGRY WINTRY CRY USED TO REMIND THE BOYS OF WONDERFUL ANIMAL STORIES ABOUT GRAY WOLVES AND BEARS IN THE ROCKIES
1845-147962-0028 WILDCATS AND PANTHERS IN THE VIRGINIA MOUNTAINS SOMETIMES FUCHS COULD BE PERSUADED TO TALK ABOUT THE OUTLAWS AND DESPERATE CHARACTERS HE HAD KNOWN I REMEMBER ONE FUNNY STORY ABOUT HIMSELF THAT MADE GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS WORKING HER BREAD ON THE BREAD BOARD
1845-147962-0029 LAUGH UNTIL SHE WIPED HER EYES WITH HER BARE ARM HER HANDS BEING FLOURY IT WAS LIKE THIS WHEN OTTO LEFT AUSTRIA TO COME TO AMERICA HE WAS ASKED BY ONE OF HIS RELATIVES TO LOOK AFTER A WOMAN WHO WAS CROSSING ON THE SAME BOAT
1845-147962-0030 TO JOIN HER HUSBAND IN CHICAGO THE WOMAN STARTED OFF WITH TWO CHILDREN BUT IT WAS CLEAR THAT HER FAMILY MIGHT GROW LARGER ON THE JOURNEY FUCHS SAID HE GOT ON FINE WITH THE KIDS AND LIKED THE MOTHER THOUGH SHE PLAYED A SORRY TRICK ON HIM
1845-147962-0031 IN MID OCEAN SHE PROCEEDED TO HAVE NOT ONE BABY BUT THREE THIS EVENT MADE FUCHS THE OBJECT OF UNDESERVED NOTORIETY SINCE HE WAS TRAVELING WITH HER THE STEERAGE STEWARDESS WAS INDIGNANT WITH HIM THE DOCTOR REGARDED HIM WITH SUSPICION
1845-147962-0032 THE FIRST CABIN PASSENGERS WHO MADE UP A PURSE FOR THE WOMAN TOOK AN EMBARRASSING INTEREST IN OTTO AND OFTEN INQUIRED OF HIM ABOUT HIS CHARGE WHEN THE TRIPLETS WERE TAKEN ASHORE AT NEW YORK HE HAD AS HE SAID TO CARRY SOME OF THEM
1845-147962-0033 THE TRIP TO CHICAGO WAS EVEN WORSE THAN THE OCEAN VOYAGE ON THE TRAIN IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET MILK FOR THE BABIES AND TO KEEP THEIR BOTTLES CLEAN THE MOTHER DID HER BEST BUT NO WOMAN OUT OF HER NATURAL RESOURCES COULD FEED THREE BABIES THE HUSBAND IN CHICAGO
1845-147962-0034 BUT HE HAD A SULLEN EYE FOR ME ALL RIGHT NOW DID YOU EVER HEAR OF A YOUNG FELLER'S HAVING SUCH HARD LUCK MISSUS BURDEN
2085-147968-0000 INDEED HE WAS NEVER THE SAME HORSE AFTERWARD
2085-147968-0001 FUCHS BROUGHT HOME WITH HIM A STRANGER A YOUNG BOHEMIAN WHO HAD TAKEN A HOMESTEAD NEAR BLACK HAWK AND WHO CAME ON HIS ONLY HORSE TO HELP HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN IN THEIR TROUBLE THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW ANTON JELINEK
2085-147968-0002 HE WAS A STRAPPING YOUNG FELLOW IN THE EARLY TWENTIES THEN HANDSOME WARM HEARTED AND FULL OF LIFE
2085-147968-0003 I REMEMBER EXACTLY HOW HE STRODE INTO OUR KITCHEN IN HIS FELT BOOTS AND LONG WOLFSKIN COAT HIS EYES AND CHEEKS BRIGHT WITH THE COLD AT SIGHT OF GRANDMOTHER HE SNATCHED OFF HIS FUR CAP GREETING HER IN A DEEP ROLLING VOICE WHICH SEEMED OLDER THAN HE
2085-147968-0004 I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISSUS BURDEN FOR THAT YOU ARE SO KIND TO POOR STRANGERS FROM MY KAWN TREE HE DID NOT HESITATE LIKE A FARMER BOY BUT LOOKED ONE EAGERLY IN THE EYE WHEN HE SPOKE EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS WARM AND SPONTANEOUS
2085-147968-0005 AT DINNER GRANDFATHER TALKED TO JELINEK MORE THAN HE USUALLY DID TO STRANGERS WILL THEY BE MUCH DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE WE CANNOT GET A PRIEST HE ASKED JELINEK LOOKED SERIOUS
2085-147968-0006 THEIR FATHER HAS DONE A GREAT SIN HE LOOKED STRAIGHT AT GRANDFATHER OUR LORD HAS SAID THAT GRANDFATHER SEEMED TO LIKE HIS FRANKNESS WE BELIEVE THAT TOO JELINEK BUT WE BELIEVE THAT MISTER SHIMERDA'S SOUL WILL COME TO ITS CREATOR AS WELL OFF WITHOUT A PRIEST
2085-147968-0007 TOO MUCH WE ASKED HIM WHAT HE MEANT HE GLANCED AROUND THE TABLE YOU WANT I SHALL TELL YOU WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY LIKE THIS ONE I BEGIN TO HELP THE PRIEST AT THE ALTAR I MAKE MY FIRST COMMUNION VERY YOUNG
2085-147968-0008 WHAT THE CHURCH TEACH SEEM PLAIN TO ME BY N BY WAR TIMES COME WHEN THE AUSTRIANS FIGHT US WE HAVE VERY MANY SOLDIERS IN CAMP NEAR MY VILLAGE AND THE CHOLERA BREAK OUT IN THAT CAMP AND THE MEN DIE LIKE FLIES
2085-147968-0009 ALL DAY LONG OUR PRIEST GO ABOUT THERE TO GIVE THE SACRAMENT TO DYING MEN AND I GO WITH HIM TO CARRY THE VESSELS WITH THE HOLY SACRAMENT EVERYBODY THAT GO NEAR THAT CAMP CATCH THE SICKNESS BUT ME AND THE PRIEST BUT WE HAVE NO SICKNESS WE HAVE NO FEAR
2085-147968-0010 BECAUSE WE CARRY THAT BLOOD AND THAT BODY OF CHRIST AND IT PRESERVE US HE PAUSED LOOKING AT GRANDFATHER THAT I KNOW MISTER BURDEN FOR IT HAPPENED TO MYSELF ALL THE SOLDIERS KNOW TOO WHEN WE WALK ALONG THE ROAD
2085-147968-0011 AND I FEEL SAD FOR HIS FAMILY WE HAD LISTENED ATTENTIVELY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO ADMIRE HIS FRANK MANLY FAITH I AM ALWAYS GLAD TO MEET A YOUNG MAN WHO THINKS SERIOUSLY ABOUT THESE THINGS SAID GRANDFATHER
2085-147968-0012 AND I WOULD NEVER BE THE ONE TO SAY YOU WERE NOT IN GOD'S CARE WHEN YOU WERE AMONG THE SOLDIERS AFTER DINNER IT WAS DECIDED THAT YOUNG JELINEK SHOULD HOOK OUR TWO STRONG BLACK FARMHORSES TO THE SCRAPER AND BREAK A ROAD THROUGH TO THE SHIMERDAS SO THAT A WAGON COULD GO WHEN IT WAS NECESSARY
2085-147968-0013 FUCHS WHO WAS THE ONLY CABINET MAKER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS SET TO WORK ON A COFFIN JELINEK PUT ON HIS LONG WOLFSKIN COAT AND WHEN WE ADMIRED IT HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD SHOT AND SKINNED THE COYOTES AND THE YOUNG MAN WHO BATCHED WITH HIM
2085-147968-0014 OUR HEAVY CARPENTER'S BENCH HAD TO BE BROUGHT FROM THE BARN AND CARRIED DOWN INTO THE KITCHEN FUCHS SELECTED BOARDS FROM A PILE OF PLANKS GRANDFATHER HAD HAULED OUT FROM TOWN IN THE FALL TO MAKE A NEW FLOOR FOR THE OATS BIN WHEN AT LAST THE LUMBER AND TOOLS WERE ASSEMBLED
2085-147968-0015 AND THE DOORS WERE CLOSED AGAIN AND THE COLD DRAFTS SHUT OUT GRANDFATHER RODE AWAY TO MEET THE CORONER AT THE SHIMERDAS AND FUCHS TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND SETTLED DOWN TO WORK I SAT ON HIS WORK TABLE AND WATCHED HIM
2085-147968-0016 HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS TOOLS AT FIRST BUT FIGURED FOR A LONG WHILE ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND MEASURED THE PLANKS AND MADE MARKS ON THEM WHILE HE WAS THUS ENGAGED HE WHISTLED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF OR TEASINGLY PULLED AT HIS HALF EAR
2085-147968-0017 GRANDMOTHER MOVED ABOUT QUIETLY SO AS NOT TO DISTURB HIM AT LAST HE FOLDED HIS RULER AND TURNED A CHEERFUL FACE TO US
2085-147968-0018 WAS FOR A FELLOW IN THE BLACK TIGER MINE UP ABOVE SILVERTON COLORADO
2085-147968-0019 TWO SWEDES HAD FELL OUT OF THAT BUCKET ONCE AND HIT THE WATER FEET DOWN

2085-147968-0021 GRANDMOTHER SAID YES M FUCHS ADMITTED WITH MODEST PRIDE SO FEW FOLKS DOES KNOW HOW TO MAKE A GOOD TIGHT BOX THAT'LL TURN WATER I SOMETIMES WONDER IF THERE'LL BE ANYBODY ABOUT TO DO IT FOR ME
2085-147968-0022 ALL AFTERNOON WHEREVER ONE WENT IN THE HOUSE ONE COULD HEAR THE PANTING WHEEZE OF THE SAW OR THE PLEASANT PURRING OF THE PLANE THEY WERE SUCH CHEERFUL NOISES SEEMING TO PROMISE NEW THINGS FOR LIVING PEOPLE
2085-147968-0023 IT WAS A PITY THAT THOSE FRESHLY PLANED PINE BOARDS WERE TO BE PUT UNDERGROUND SO SOON THE LUMBER WAS HARD TO WORK BECAUSE IT WAS FULL OF FROST AND THE BOARDS GAVE OFF A SWEET SMELL OF PINE WOODS AS THE HEAP OF YELLOW SHAVINGS GREW HIGHER AND HIGHER
2085-147968-0024 I WONDERED WHY FUCHS HAD NOT STUCK TO CABINET WORK HE SETTLED DOWN TO IT WITH SUCH EASE AND CONTENT HE HANDLED THE TOOLS AS IF HE LIKED THE FEEL OF THEM AND WHEN HE PLANED HIS HANDS WENT BACK AND FORTH OVER THE BOARDS IN AN EAGER BENEFICENT WAY AS IF HE WERE BLESSING THEM
2085-147968-0025 HE BROKE OUT NOW AND THEN INTO GERMAN HYMNS AS IF THIS OCCUPATION BROUGHT BACK OLD TIMES TO HIM AT FOUR O'CLOCK MISTER BUSHY THE POSTMASTER WITH ANOTHER NEIGHBOR WHO LIVED EAST OF US STOPPED IN TO GET WARM THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO THE SHIMERDAS
2085-147968-0026 THE NEWS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED OVER THERE HAD SOMEHOW GOT ABROAD THROUGH THE SNOW BLOCKED COUNTRY GRANDMOTHER GAVE THE VISITORS SUGAR CAKES AND HOT COFFEE
2085-147968-0027 BEFORE THESE CALLERS WERE GONE THE BROTHER OF THE WIDOW STEAVENS WHO LIVED ON THE BLACK HAWK ROAD DREW UP AT OUR DOOR AND AFTER HIM CAME THE FATHER OF THE GERMAN FAMILY OUR NEAREST NEIGHBORS ON THE SOUTH THEY DISMOUNTED AND JOINED US IN THE DINING ROOM
2085-147968-0028 THEY WERE ALL EAGER FOR ANY DETAILS ABOUT THE SUICIDE AND THEY WERE GREATLY CONCERNED AS TO WHERE MISTER SHIMERDA WOULD BE BURIED THE NEAREST CATHOLIC CEMETERY WAS AT BLACK HAWK
2085-147968-0029 THERE WAS A BURYING GROUND OVER BY THE NORWEGIAN CHURCH WEST OF SQUAW CREEK PERHAPS THE NORWEGIANS WOULD TAKE MISTER SHIMERDA IN
2085-147968-0030 UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS TALKED DEAR WOMAN TO HERSELF OR TO THE LORD IF THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO LISTEN BUT GRANDFATHER WAS NATURALLY TACITURN
2085-147968-0031 AND JAKE AND OTTO WERE OFTEN SO TIRED AFTER SUPPER THAT I USED TO FEEL AS IF I WERE SURROUNDED BY A WALL OF SILENCE NOW EVERY ONE SEEMED EAGER TO TALK THAT AFTERNOON FUCHS TOLD ME STORY AFTER STORY ABOUT THE BLACK TIGER MINE
2085-147968-0032 MOST MEN WERE GAME AND WENT WITHOUT A GRUDGE THE POSTMASTER GOING HOME STOPPED TO SAY THAT GRANDFATHER WOULD BRING THE CORONER BACK WITH HIM TO SPEND THE NIGHT THE OFFICERS OF THE NORWEGIAN CHURCH HE TOLD US
2085-147968-0033 HAD HELD A MEETING AND DECIDED THAT THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD COULD NOT EXTEND ITS HOSPITALITY TO MISTER SHIMERDA GRANDMOTHER WAS INDIGNANT IF THESE FOREIGNERS ARE SO CLANNISH MISTER BUSHY WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE AN AMERICAN GRAVEYARD THAT WILL BE MORE LIBERAL MINDED
2085-147968-0034 I'LL GET RIGHT AFTER JOSIAH TO START ONE IN THE SPRING IF ANYTHING WAS TO HAPPEN TO ME I DON'T WANT THE NORWEGIANS HOLDING INQUISITIONS OVER ME TO SEE WHETHER I'M GOOD ENOUGH TO BE LAID AMONGST EM SOON GRANDFATHER RETURNED BRINGING WITH HIM ANTON JELINEK AND THAT IMPORTANT PERSON THE CORONER
2085-147968-0035 HE WAS A MILD FLURRIED OLD MAN A CIVIL WAR VETERAN WITH ONE SLEEVE HANGING EMPTY HE SEEMED TO FIND THIS CASE VERY PERPLEXING AND SAID
2085-147968-0036 THE WAY HE ACTED AND THE WAY HIS AXE FIT THE WOUND WAS ENOUGH TO CONVICT ANY MAN
2085-147968-0037 HE WAS BADLY FRIGHTENED CERTAINLY AND PERHAPS HE EVEN FELT SOME STIRRINGS OF REMORSE FOR HIS INDIFFERENCE TO THE OLD MAN'S MISERY AND LONELINESS AT SUPPER THE MEN ATE LIKE VIKINGS AND THE CHOCOLATE CAKE WHICH I HAD HOPED WOULD LINGER ON UNTIL TO MORROW IN A MUTILATED CONDITION
2085-147968-0038 DISAPPEARED ON THE SECOND ROUND THEY TALKED EXCITEDLY ABOUT WHERE THEY SHOULD BURY MISTER SHIMERDA I GATHERED THAT THE NEIGHBORS WERE ALL DISTURBED AND SHOCKED ABOUT SOMETHING IT DEVELOPED THAT MISSUS SHIMERDA AND AMBROSCH WANTED THE OLD MAN BURIED ON THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THEIR OWN LAND
2085-147968-0039 GRANDFATHER HAD EXPLAINED TO AMBROSCH THAT SOME DAY WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS PUT UNDER FENCE AND THE ROADS WERE CONFINED TO SECTION LINES TWO ROADS WOULD CROSS EXACTLY ON THAT CORNER BUT AMBROSCH ONLY SAID IT MAKES NO MATTER
2085-147968-0040 GRANDFATHER ASKED JELINEK WHETHER IN THE OLD COUNTRY THERE WAS SOME SUPERSTITION TO THE EFFECT THAT A SUICIDE MUST BE BURIED AT THE CROSS ROADS
2085-147968-0041 HE SEEMED TO REMEMBER HEARING THERE HAD ONCE BEEN SUCH A CUSTOM IN BOHEMIA MISSUS SHIMERDA IS MADE UP HER MIND HE ADDED I TRY TO PERSUADE HER AND SAY IT LOOKS BAD FOR HER TO ALL THE NEIGHBORS BUT SHE SAY SO IT MUST BE
2085-147968-0042 THERE I WILL BURY HIM IF I DIG THE GRAVE MYSELF SHE SAY I HAVE TO PROMISE HER I HELP AMBROSCH MAKE THE GRAVE TO MORROW GRANDFATHER SMOOTHED HIS BEARD AND LOOKED JUDICIAL
2085-147970-0000 WHEN SPRING CAME AFTER THAT HARD WINTER ONE COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF THE NIMBLE AIR EVERY MORNING I WAKENED WITH A FRESH CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WINTER WAS OVER THERE WERE NONE OF THE SIGNS OF SPRING FOR WHICH I USED TO WATCH IN VIRGINIA NO BUDDING WOODS OR BLOOMING GARDENS
2085-147970-0001 THERE WAS ONLY SPRING ITSELF THE THROB OF IT THE LIGHT RESTLESSNESS
2085-147970-0002 RISING SUDDENLY SINKING SUDDENLY IMPULSIVE AND PLAYFUL LIKE A BIG PUPPY THAT PAWED YOU AND THEN LAY DOWN TO BE PETTED IF I HAD BEEN TOSSED DOWN BLINDFOLD ON THAT RED PRAIRIE I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT WAS SPRING EVERYWHERE NOW THERE WAS THE SMELL OF BURNING GRASS
2085-147970-0003 OUR NEIGHBORS BURNED OFF THEIR PASTURE BEFORE THE NEW GRASS MADE A START SO THAT THE FRESH GROWTH WOULD NOT BE MIXED WITH THE DEAD STAND OF LAST YEAR THOSE LIGHT SWIFT FIRES RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY SEEMED A PART OF THE SAME KINDLING THAT WAS IN THE AIR
2085-147970-0004 THE SHIMERDAS WERE IN THEIR NEW LOG HOUSE BY THEN THE NEIGHBORS HAD HELPED THEM TO BUILD IT IN MARCH IT STOOD DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEIR OLD CAVE WHICH THEY USED AS A CELLAR THE FAMILY WERE NOW FAIRLY EQUIPPED TO BEGIN THEIR STRUGGLE WITH THE SOIL
2085-147970-0005 THEY HAD FOUR COMFORTABLE ROOMS TO LIVE IN A NEW WINDMILL BOUGHT ON CREDIT A CHICKEN HOUSE AND POULTRY MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD PAID GRANDFATHER TEN DOLLARS FOR A MILK COW AND WAS TO GIVE HIM FIFTEEN MORE AS SOON AS THEY HARVESTED THEIR FIRST CROP
2085-147970-0006 WHEN I RODE UP TO THE SHIMERDAS ONE BRIGHT WINDY AFTERNOON IN APRIL YULKA RAN OUT TO MEET ME IT WAS TO HER NOW THAT I GAVE READING LESSONS ANTONIA WAS BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS
2085-147970-0007 I TIED MY PONY AND WENT INTO THE KITCHEN WHERE MISSUS SHIMERDA WAS BAKING BREAD CHEWING POPPY SEEDS AS SHE WORKED BY THIS TIME SHE COULD SPEAK ENOUGH ENGLISH TO ASK ME A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT OUR MEN WERE DOING IN THE FIELDS
2085-147970-0008 SHE SEEMED TO THINK THAT MY ELDERS WITHHELD HELPFUL INFORMATION AND THAT FROM ME SHE MIGHT GET VALUABLE SECRETS ON THIS OCCASION SHE ASKED ME VERY CRAFTILY WHEN GRANDFATHER EXPECTED TO BEGIN PLANTING CORN
2085-147970-0009 I TOLD HER ADDING THAT HE THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE A DRY SPRING AND THAT THE CORN WOULD NOT BE HELD BACK BY TOO MUCH RAIN AS IT HAD BEEN LAST YEAR SHE GAVE ME A SHREWD GLANCE HE NOT JESUS SHE BLUSTERED HE NOT KNOW ABOUT THE WET
2085-147970-0010 AND THE DRY I DID NOT ANSWER HER WHAT WAS THE USE AS I SAT WAITING FOR THE HOUR WHEN AMBROSCH AND ANTONIA WOULD RETURN FROM THE FIELDS I WATCHED MISSUS SHIMERDA AT HER WORK SHE TOOK FROM THE OVEN A COFFEE CAKE WHICH SHE WANTED TO KEEP WARM FOR SUPPER
2085-147970-0011 AND WRAPPED IT IN A QUILT STUFFED WITH FEATHERS I HAVE SEEN HER PUT EVEN A ROAST GOOSE IN THIS QUILT TO KEEP IT HOT WHEN THE NEIGHBORS WERE THERE BUILDING THE NEW HOUSE THEY SAW HER DO THIS AND THE STORY GOT ABROAD THAT THE SHIMERDAS KEPT THEIR FOOD IN THEIR FEATHER BEDS
2085-147970-0012 WHEN THE SUN WAS DROPPING LOW ANTONIA CAME UP THE BIG SOUTH DRAW WITH HER TEAM HOW MUCH OLDER SHE HAD GROWN IN EIGHT MONTHS SHE HAD COME TO US A CHILD AND NOW SHE WAS A TALL STRONG YOUNG GIRL ALTHOUGH HER FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY HAD JUST SLIPPED BY

2085-147970-0021 WHILE SHE UNHARNESSED HER TEAM WE WALKED SLOWLY BACK TOWARD THE HOUSE AMBROSCH HAD COME IN FROM THE NORTH QUARTER AND WAS WATERING HIS OXEN AT THE TANK ANTONIA TOOK MY HAND

2085-147970-0028 AS IF THEY ACHED GRANDMOTHER HAD SAID HEAVY FIELD WORK'LL SPOIL THAT GIRL SHE'LL LOSE ALL HER NICE WAYS AND GET ROUGH ONES SHE HAD LOST THEM ALREADY AFTER SUPPER I RODE HOME THROUGH THE SAD SOFT SPRING TWILIGHT
2085-147970-0029 SINCE WINTER I HAD SEEN VERY LITTLE OF ANTONIA SHE WAS OUT IN THE FIELDS FROM SUN UP UNTIL SUN DOWN IF I RODE OVER TO SEE HER WHERE SHE WAS PLOUGHING
2085-147970-0030 MAKING ME FEEL THAT SHE WAS NOW GROWN UP AND HAD NO TIME FOR ME ON SUNDAYS SHE HELPED HER MOTHER MAKE GARDEN OR SEWED ALL DAY GRANDFATHER WAS PLEASED WITH ANTONIA WHEN WE COMPLAINED OF HER HE ONLY SMILED AND SAID
2085-147970-0031 NOWADAYS TONY COULD TALK OF NOTHING BUT THE PRICES OF THINGS OR HOW MUCH SHE COULD LIFT AND ENDURE
2085-147971-0000 AFTER I BEGAN TO GO TO THE COUNTRY SCHOOL I SAW LESS OF THE BOHEMIANS WE WERE SIXTEEN PUPILS AT THE SOD SCHOOLHOUSE AND WE ALL CAME ON HORSEBACK AND BROUGHT OUR DINNER MY SCHOOLMATES WERE NONE OF THEM VERY INTERESTING BUT I SOMEHOW FELT THAT BY MAKING COMRADES OF THEM
2085-147971-0001 I WAS GETTING EVEN WITH ANTONIA FOR HER INDIFFERENCE SINCE THE FATHER'S DEATH AMBROSCH WAS MORE THAN EVER THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE AND HE SEEMED TO DIRECT THE FEELINGS AS WELL AS THE FORTUNES OF HIS WOMEN FOLK ANTONIA OFTEN QUOTED HIS OPINIONS TO ME
2085-147971-0002 AND SHE LET ME SEE THAT SHE ADMIRED HIM WHILE SHE THOUGHT OF ME ONLY AS A LITTLE BOY BEFORE THE SPRING WAS OVER THERE WAS A DISTINCT COLDNESS BETWEEN US AND THE SHIMERDAS IT CAME ABOUT IN THIS WAY
2085-147971-0003 IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL BLUE MORNING THE BUFFALO PEAS WERE BLOOMING IN PINK AND PURPLE MASSES ALONG THE ROADSIDE AND THE LARKS PERCHED ON LAST YEAR'S DRIED SUNFLOWER STALKS WERE SINGING STRAIGHT AT THE SUN THEIR HEADS THROWN BACK AND THEIR YELLOW BREASTS A QUIVER
2085-147971-0004 THE WIND BLEW ABOUT US IN WARM SWEET GUSTS WE RODE SLOWLY WITH A PLEASANT SENSE OF SUNDAY INDOLENCE WE FOUND THE SHIMERDAS WORKING JUST AS IF IT WERE A WEEK DAY MAREK WAS CLEANING OUT THE STABLE AND ANTONIA AND HER MOTHER WERE MAKING GARDEN
2085-147971-0005 OFF ACROSS THE POND IN THE DRAW HEAD AMBROSCH WAS UP ON THE WINDMILL TOWER OILING THE WHEEL HE CAME DOWN NOT VERY CORDIALLY WHEN JAKE ASKED FOR THE COLLAR HE GRUNTED AND SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
2085-147971-0006 AMBROSCH SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAUNTERED DOWN THE HILL TOWARD THE STABLE I COULD SEE THAT IT WAS ONE OF HIS MEAN DAYS PRESENTLY HE RETURNED CARRYING A COLLAR THAT HAD BEEN BADLY USED TRAMPLED IN THE DIRT AND GNAWED BY RATS UNTIL THE HAIR WAS STICKING OUT OF IT
2085-147971-0007 THIS WHAT YOU WANT HE ASKED SURLILY JAKE JUMPED OFF HIS HORSE I SAW A WAVE OF RED COME UP UNDER THE ROUGH STUBBLE ON HIS FACE THAT AIN'T THE PIECE OF HARNESS I LOANED YOU AMBROSCH OR IF IT IS YOU'VE USED IT SHAMEFUL
2085-147971-0008 I AIN'T A GOING TO CARRY SUCH A LOOKING THING BACK TO MISTER BURDEN AMBROSCH DROPPED THE COLLAR ON THE GROUND ALL RIGHT HE SAID COOLLY TOOK UP HIS OIL CAN AND BEGAN TO CLIMB THE MILL JAKE CAUGHT HIM BY THE BELT OF HIS TROUSERS AND YANKED HIM BACK
2085-147971-0009 AMBROSCH'S FEET HAD SCARCELY TOUCHED THE GROUND WHEN HE LUNGED OUT WITH A VICIOUS KICK AT JAKE'S STOMACH FORTUNATELY JAKE WAS IN SUCH A POSITION THAT HE COULD DODGE IT THIS WAS NOT THE SORT OF THING COUNTRY BOYS DID WHEN THEY PLAYED AT FISTICUFFS AND JAKE WAS FURIOUS
2085-147971-0010 HE LANDED AMBROSCH A BLOW ON THE HEAD IT SOUNDED LIKE THE CRACK OF AN AXE ON A COW PUMPKIN AMBROSCH DROPPED OVER STUNNED WE HEARD SQUEALS AND LOOKING UP SAW ANTONIA AND HER MOTHER COMING ON THE RUN
2085-147971-0011 THEY DID NOT TAKE THE PATH AROUND THE POND BUT PLUNGED THROUGH THE MUDDY WATER WITHOUT EVEN LIFTING THEIR SKIRTS THEY CAME ON SCREAMING AND CLAWING THE AIR
2085-147971-0012 LAW LAW SHE SHRIEKED AFTER US LAW FOR KNOCK MY AMBROSCH DOWN I NEVER LIKE YOU NO MORE JAKE AND JIM BURDEN ANTONIA PANTED NO FRIENDS ANY MORE
2085-147971-0013 JAKE STOPPED AND TURNED HIS HORSE FOR A SECOND WELL YOU'RE A DAMNED UNGRATEFUL LOT THE WHOLE PACK OF YOU HE SHOUTED BACK I GUESS THE BURDENS CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU YOU'VE BEEN A SIGHT OF TROUBLE TO THEM ANYHOW
2085-147971-0014 WE RODE AWAY FEELING SO OUTRAGED THAT THE FINE MORNING WAS SPOILED FOR US I HAD N'T A WORD TO SAY AND POOR JAKE WAS WHITE AS PAPER AND TREMBLING ALL OVER IT MADE HIM SICK TO GET SO ANGRY
2085-147971-0015 THESE FOREIGNERS AIN'T THE SAME YOU CAN'T TRUST EM TO BE FAIR IT'S DIRTY TO KICK A FELLER YOU HEARD HOW THE WOMEN TURNED ON YOU
2085-147971-0016 THEY AIN'T TO BE TRUSTED I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GET TOO THICK WITH ANY OF EM
2085-147971-0017 GRANDFATHER HEARD OUR STORY WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE HE ADVISED JAKE TO RIDE TO TOWN TO MORROW
2085-147971-0018 THEN IF MISSUS SHIMERDA WAS INCLINED TO MAKE TROUBLE HER SON WAS STILL UNDER AGE SHE WOULD BE FORESTALLED
2085-147971-0019 ON MONDAY ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER JAKE HAD STARTED WE SAW MISSUS SHIMERDA AND HER AMBROSCH PROUDLY DRIVING BY LOOKING NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR LEFT AS THEY RATTLED OUT OF SIGHT DOWN THE BLACK HAWK ROAD
2085-147971-0020 GRANDFATHER CHUCKLED SAYING HE HAD RATHER EXPECTED SHE WOULD FOLLOW THE MATTER UP JAKE PAID HIS FINE WITH A TEN DOLLAR BILL GRANDFATHER HAD GIVEN HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT WHEN THE SHIMERDAS FOUND THAT JAKE SOLD HIS PIG IN TOWN THAT DAY
2085-147971-0021 AMBROSCH WORKED IT OUT IN HIS SHREWD HEAD THAT JAKE HAD TO SELL HIS PIG TO PAY HIS FINE THIS THEORY AFFORDED THE SHIMERDAS GREAT SATISFACTION APPARENTLY FOR WEEKS AFTERWARD WHENEVER JAKE AND I MET ANTONIA ON HER WAY TO THE POST OFFICE
2085-147971-0022 OR GOING ALONG THE ROAD WITH HER WORK TEAM SHE WOULD CLAP HER HANDS AND CALL TO US IN A SPITEFUL CROWING VOICE
2085-147971-0023 OTTO PRETENDED NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANTONIA'S BEHAVIOR HE ONLY LIFTED HIS BROWS AND SAID YOU CAN'T TELL ME ANYTHING NEW ABOUT A CZECH I'M AN AUSTRIAN GRANDFATHER WAS NEVER A PARTY TO WHAT JAKE CALLED OUR FEUD WITH THE SHIMERDAS
2085-147971-0024 AMBROSCH AND ANTONIA ALWAYS GREETED HIM RESPECTFULLY AND HE ASKED THEM ABOUT THEIR AFFAIRS AND GAVE THEM ADVICE AS USUAL HE THOUGHT THE FUTURE LOOKED HOPEFUL FOR THEM AMBROSCH WAS A FAR SEEING FELLOW HE SOON REALIZED THAT HIS OXEN WERE TOO HEAVY FOR ANY WORK EXCEPT BREAKING SOD
2085-147971-0025 AND HE SUCCEEDED IN SELLING THEM TO A NEWLY ARRIVED GERMAN WITH THE MONEY HE BOUGHT ANOTHER TEAM OF HORSES WHICH GRANDFATHER SELECTED FOR HIM MAREK WAS STRONG AND AMBROSCH WORKED HIM HARD BUT HE COULD NEVER TEACH HIM TO CULTIVATE CORN I REMEMBER
2085-147971-0026 THE ONE IDEA THAT HAD EVER GOT THROUGH POOR MAREK'S THICK HEAD WAS THAT ALL EXERTION WAS MERITORIOUS HE ALWAYS BORE DOWN ON THE HANDLES OF THE CULTIVATOR AND DROVE THE BLADES SO DEEP INTO THE EARTH THAT THE HORSES WERE SOON EXHAUSTED
2085-147971-0027 AND TOOK MAREK WITH HIM AT FULL WAGES MISSUS SHIMERDA THEN DROVE THE SECOND CULTIVATOR SHE AND ANTONIA WORKED IN THE FIELDS ALL DAY AND DID THE CHORES AT NIGHT WHILE THE TWO WOMEN WERE RUNNING THE PLACE ALONE ONE OF THE NEW HORSES GOT COLIC AND GAVE THEM A TERRIBLE FRIGHT
2085-147971-0028 ANTONIA HAD GONE DOWN TO THE BARN ONE NIGHT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS WELL BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED AND SHE NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE ROANS WAS SWOLLEN ABOUT THE MIDDLE AND STOOD WITH ITS HEAD HANGING SHE MOUNTED ANOTHER HORSE WITHOUT WAITING TO SADDLE HIM
2085-147971-0029 AND HAMMERED ON OUR DOOR JUST AS WE WERE GOING TO BED GRANDFATHER ANSWERED HER KNOCK HE DID NOT SEND ONE OF HIS MEN BUT RODE BACK WITH HER HIMSELF
2085-147971-0030 HE FOUND MISSUS SHIMERDA SITTING BY THE HORSE WITH HER LANTERN GROANING AND WRINGING HER HANDS IT TOOK BUT A FEW MOMENTS TO RELEASE THE GASES PENT UP IN THE POOR BEAST AND THE TWO WOMEN HEARD THE RUSH OF WIND AND SAW THE ROAN VISIBLY DIMINISH IN GIRTH
2085-147971-0031 IF I LOSE THAT HORSE MISTER BURDEN ANTONIA EXCLAIMED I NEVER STAY HERE TILL AMBROSCH COME HOME I GO DROWN MYSELF IN THE POND BEFORE MORNING
2085-147971-0032 WHEN AMBROSCH CAME BACK FROM MISTER BUSHY'S WE LEARNED THAT HE HAD GIVEN MAREK'S WAGES TO THE PRIEST AT BLACK HAWK FOR MASSES FOR THEIR FATHER'S SOUL GRANDMOTHER THOUGHT ANTONIA NEEDED SHOES MORE THAN MISTER SHIMERDA NEEDED PRAYERS BUT GRANDFATHER SAID TOLERANTLY
2085-147971-0033 IF HE CAN SPARE SIX DOLLARS PINCHED AS HE IS IT SHOWS HE BELIEVES WHAT HE PROFESSES IT WAS GRANDFATHER WHO BROUGHT ABOUT A RECONCILIATION WITH THE SHIMERDAS
2085-147971-0034 ONE MORNING HE TOLD US THAT THE SMALL GRAIN WAS COMING ON SO WELL HE THOUGHT HE WOULD BEGIN TO CUT HIS WHEAT ON THE FIRST OF JULY HE WOULD NEED MORE MEN AND IF IT WERE AGREEABLE TO EVERY ONE HE WOULD ENGAGE AMBROSCH FOR THE REAPING AND THRASHING AS THE SHIMERDAS HAD NO SMALL GRAIN OF THEIR OWN
2085-147971-0035 I THINK EMMALINE HE CONCLUDED I WILL ASK ANTONIA TO COME OVER AND HELP YOU IN THE KITCHEN SHE WILL BE GLAD TO EARN SOMETHING AND IT WILL BE A GOOD TIME TO END MISUNDERSTANDINGS I MAY AS WELL RIDE OVER THIS MORNING AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
2085-147971-0036 HIS TONE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD ALREADY DECIDED FOR ME AFTER BREAKFAST WE SET OFF TOGETHER
2085-147971-0037 GRANDFATHER SMILED TO HIMSELF WHILE HE TIED HIS HORSE AND WE FOLLOWED HER BEHIND THE BARN WE CAME UPON A FUNNY SIGHT THE COW HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN GRAZING SOMEWHERE IN THE DRAW MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD RUN TO THE ANIMAL PULLED UP THE LARIAT PIN
2085-147971-0038 AND WHEN WE CAME UPON HER SHE WAS TRYING TO HIDE THE COW IN AN OLD CAVE IN THE BANK
2085-147971-0039 GOOD MORNING MISSUS SHIMERDA CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I WILL FIND AMBROSCH WHICH FIELD HE WITH THE SOD CORN SHE POINTED TOWARD THE NORTH STILL STANDING IN FRONT OF THE COW AS IF SHE HOPED TO CONCEAL IT

2093-143262-0022 OR SHARED BY OUR GUIDE I SHOULD HAVE STRUCK FULL AGAINST THE TRUNK OF SOME TREE AS IT WAS I MET WITH A FEW UNPLEASANT BLOWS ON ARM OR SHOULDER THOUGH THE EXCITEMENT OF OUR FLIGHT WAS TOO GREAT FOR ME TO HEED THEM THEN
2093-143262-0023 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOOLISH SEEING HOW MUCH BETTER I COULD SERVE HIM BY BEING FREE BUT I FELT READY TO HURRY BACK AND SHARE MY FATHER'S CAPTIVITY FOR I FELT ASSURED THAT IT MUST BE HE OF WHOM OUR GUIDE SPOKE
2093-143262-0024 WE WERE HURRYING ON ALL THIS TIME ENTIRELY UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE STRANGE BEING WHO HAD SET US FREE BUT NOT WITHOUT PROTESTS FROM THE BLACK WHO WAS GROWING JEALOUS OF OUR GUIDE AND WHO KEPT ON WHISPERING

2093-143262-0026 HIS WORDS EVIDENTLY MEANT FALL BACK BUT I HAD RECOGNISED THAT GROWL GYP I CRIED AND THE GROWLING CHANGED TO A WHINING CRY OF JOY AND IN AN INSTANT THE DOG WAS LEAPING UP AT MY FACE

2093-143262-0030 AND GYP MADE A BOUND FROM MY SIDE INTO THE DARKNESS LEAVING US ALONE
2093-143262-0031 THEN THERE WAS MORE RUSTLING THE DOG CAME PANTING BACK AND AS THE RUSTLING CONTINUED THERE CAME OUT OF THE DARKNESS A SOUND THAT MADE MY HEART LEAP IT WAS ONLY MY NAME SOFTLY UTTERED APPARENTLY CLOSE AT HAND
2093-143262-0032 DEAR JOE CAME BACK AND WELL IT WAS IN THE DARK AND WE WERE NOT ASHAMED
2093-143264-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY TWO HOW WE HEARD A BLACK DISCUSSION AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE RESCUE PARTY CONSISTED OF THE DOCTOR
2093-143264-0001 AND MYSELF WITH JIMMY FOR GUIDE JACK PENNY WAS TO TAKE COMMAND OF THE CAVE AND BE READY TO DEFEND IT AND HELP US IF ATTACKED OR WE WERE PURSUED AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS TO HAVE THE BEARERS
2093-143264-0002 AND EVERYTHING IN READINESS FOR AN IMMEDIATE START IN CASE WE DECIDED TO CONTINUE OUR FLIGHT I THINK THAT'S ALL WE CAN SAY PENNY SAID THE DOCTOR IN A LOW GRAVE VOICE AS WE STOOD READY TO START
2093-143264-0003 AND HIS VOICE SOUNDED HOLLOW AND STRANGE GYP UTTERED A WHINE THAT DOG HAD BEEN SO WELL TRAINED THAT HE RARELY BARKED RAN QUICKLY UP THE FURTHER BANK OF THE RIVULET
2093-143264-0004 THE EXCITEMENT I FELT WAS SO GREAT THAT IT SEEMED A VERY LITTLE WHILE BEFORE JIMMY STOPPED SHORT TO LISTEN HEAR UM TALKUM TALKUM HE WHISPERED WE COULD NEITHER OF US HEAR A SOUND
2093-143264-0005 BUT I HAD GREAT FAITH IN JIMMY'S HEARING FOR IN OLD TIMES HE HAD GIVEN ME SOME REMARKABLE INSTANCES OF THE ACUTENESS OF THIS SENSE
2093-143264-0006 YOU HAVE FOUND HIM I CRIED NOT TALK SHOUTO SO WHISPERED JIMMY BLACK FELLOW COME BUT HAVE YOU FOUND HIM I WHISPERED GOING A FIND UM ALL SOON NUFF HE REPLIED COOLLY
2093-143264-0007 COME LONG NOW HE STRUCK OFF TO THE RIGHT AND WE FOLLOWED
2093-143264-0008 FOR WE SOON HEARD THE BUSY HUM OF MANY VOICES A HUM WHICH SOON AFTER DEVELOPED INTO A LOUD CHATTER WITH OCCASIONAL ANGRY OUTBURSTS AS IF SOMETHING WERE BEING DISCUSSED
2093-143264-0009 JIMMY WENT ON GYP KEEPING CLOSE TO HIS HEELS NOW AS IF HE QUITE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT BEING SEEN WE HAD LEFT THE DENSE FOREST AND WERE WALKING IN A MORE OPEN PART AMONG TALL TREES
2093-143264-0010 BENEATH WHICH IT WAS BLACK AS EVER BUT OUTSIDE THE STARS SHONE BRILLIANTLY AND IT WAS COMPARATIVELY LIGHT
2093-143264-0011 THE VOICES SEEMED SO NEAR NOW THAT I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TOO FAR AND JUST THEN JIMMY RAISED HIS HAND AND STOPPED US BEFORE WHAT SEEMED TO BE A PATCH OF BLACK DARKNESS
2093-143264-0012 AND I FOUND THAT WE WERE IN THE SHADOW CAST BY A LONG HUT WHOSE BACK WAS WITHIN A YARD OR SO OF OUR FEET JIMMY PLACED HIS LIPS CLOSE TO MY EAR THEN TO THE DOCTOR'S AND TO EACH OF US HE WHISPERED SOON GO SLEEP SLEEP
2093-143264-0013 ALL TOP HERE JIMMY GO SEE I QUITE SHARED WITH THE DOCTOR THE FEELING OF HELPLESS ANNOYANCE AT HAVING TO DEPEND SO MUCH ON THE BLACK
2093-143264-0014 FROM WHERE WE STOOD WE COULD SEE A GROUP OF THE SAVAGES STANDING NOT THIRTY YARDS FROM US THEIR PRESENCE BEING FIRST MADE PLAIN BY THEIR EAGER TALKING AND I PRESSED THE DOCTOR'S ARM AND POINTED YES HE WHISPERED
2093-143264-0015 BUT WE ARE IN THE SHADOW FROM HUTS TO RIGHT AND LEFT WE COULD HEAR TALKING BUT THAT IN FRONT OF US WAS SILENT AND I BEGAN WONDERING WHETHER IT WAS THE ONE THAT HAD BEEN MY PRISON BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL
2093-143264-0016 I COULD NOT EVEN MAKE OUT THE TREE WHERE JIMMY HAD BEEN TIED ALL AT ONCE A SENSATION AS OF PANIC SEIZED ME FOR THE GROUP OF BLACKS SET UP A LOUD SHOUT AND CAME RUNNING TOWARDS WHERE WE WERE
2093-143264-0017 I WAS SURE THEY SAW US AND WITH A WORD OF WARNING TO THE DOCTOR I TURNED AND SHOULD HAVE FLED BUT FOR TWO HANDS THAT WERE LAID UPON MY SHOULDERS PRESSING ME DOWN THE DOCTOR CROUCHING LIKEWISE
2093-143264-0018 AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS JIMMY BUT TURNING MY HEAD
2093-143264-0019 WHOSE HAND NOW MOVED FROM MY SHOULDER TO MY LIPS I DREW A BREATH FULL OF RELIEF THE NEXT MOMENT FOR IN PLACE OF DASHING DOWN UPON US THE BLACKS RUSHED INTO THE HUT BEHIND WHICH WE WERE STANDING CROWDING IT
2093-143264-0020 AND THERE WAS NOTHING NOW BUT A WALL OF DRIED AND INTERWOVEN PALM LEAVES BETWEEN US AND OUR FIERCE ENEMIES HERE A LOUD ALTERCATION SEEMED TO ENSUE ANGRY VOICES BEING HEARD
2093-143264-0021 AND SEVERAL TIMES OVER I THOUGHT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A FIGHT
2093-143264-0022 AND ANOTHER BEGAN WE DARED NOT STIR FOR NOW IT SEEMED TO BE SO LIGHT
2093-143264-0023 AND THERE WAS A DEAD SILENCE AS IF THOSE WITHIN WERE LISTENING INTENTLY WE HELD OUR BREATH AND LISTENED TOO TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT FOR ALL AT ONCE WE HEARD A VOICE UTTER A FEW WORDS
2093-143264-0024 AND THEN THERE WAS A FAINT SOUND OF RUSTLING WITH THE CRACKING NOISE MADE BY A JOINT AS IF SOME ONE HAD RISEN TO A STANDING POSITION WERE THE SAVAGES COMING ROUND TO OUR SIDE AND ABOUT TO LEAP UPON US
2093-143264-0025 AND MY HEART IN THE TERRIBLE EXCITEMENT KEPT ON A HEAVY DULL THROB WHICH SEEMED TO BEAT RIGHT UP INTO MY THROAT THE MOMENTS PASSED AWAY THOUGH AND AT LAST I BEGAN TO BREATHE MORE FREELY
2093-143264-0026 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE SAVAGES HAD QUITTED THE HUT IN THIS BELIEF I LAID MY HAND UPON THE DOCTOR'S ARM AND WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WHEN CLOSE BY US AS IT SEEMED
2093-143264-0027 WAITING TO SEE IF THE BLACK HAD MADE ANY DISCOVERY AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO ME AN INTERMINABLE TIME I HEARD A SLIGHT RUSTLING SOUND AND ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT THERE WAS A HAND UPON MY ARM AND DIRECTLY AFTER A WARM PAIR OF LIPS UPON MY EAR
2093-143264-0028 TAKE UM OUT O PLACE PLACE PUT UM SOMEWHERE NO KNOW TELL I PLACED MY LIPS TO HIS EAR IN TURN AND WHISPERED THAT THERE WAS SOME ONE LEFT IN THE HUT JIMMY GO SEE HE SAID SOFTLY AND BEFORE I COULD STAY HIM
2093-143264-0029 HE WAS GONE WHAT IS IT WHISPERED THE DOCTOR AND I TOLD HIM THE DOCTOR DREW HIS PISTOL I HEARD HIM IN THE DARKNESS AND GRASPED MY ARM AS IF TO BE READY FOR FLIGHT BUT
2093-143264-0030 JUST THEN I HEARD A VOICE IN THE HUT WHICH MADE ME START WITH JOY THEN THERE WAS A RUSTLING SOUND AND JIMMY CAME ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HUT ALL RIGHTUMS HE WHISPERED
2093-143264-0031 SAID THE POOR FELLOW IN A LOW PUZZLED VOICE AS IF HIS MIND WERE WANDERING YES I AM THE DOCTOR THEY MADE ME THEIR DOCTOR WHEN THE FEVER WHEN OH MY BOY MY BOY
2093-143264-0032 HE SLIPPED AWAY FROM US BEFORE WE COULD STOP HIM AND WHILE WE WERE DEBATING AS TO WHETHER WE HAD NOT BETTER RUSH IN AND FIGHT IN HIS DEFENCE THE SAVAGES CROWDED INTO THE HUT AND ONCE MORE THERE WAS A LOUD BUZZ OF VOICES
2093-143264-0034 THEN THE CHIEF SAVAGE SPOKE AGAIN IN STERN TONES THERE WAS A BUZZ OF VOICES ONCE MORE AND THE SAVAGES SEEMED TO FILE OUT AND CROSS THE OPENING TOWARDS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VILLAGE
2093-143264-0035 WE DARED NOT MOVE BUT REMAINED THERE LISTENING NOT KNOWING BUT THAT A GUARD MIGHT HAVE BEEN LEFT BUT AT THE END OF A MINUTE OR TWO OUR FRIEND WAS BACK AT OUR SIDE TO SAY EXCITEDLY I WANT TO HELP YOU BUT MY HEAD
2093-143264-0036 I FORGET I CANNOT SPEAK SOMETIMES I CANNOT THINK IT IS ALL DARK HERE HERE IN MY MIND WHY HAVE YOU COME WE ARE FRIENDS SAID THE DOCTOR WHERE IS MISTER CARSTAIRS
2093-143264-0037 CARSTAIRS MISTER CARSTAIRS
2093-143264-0038 TANTALISING ME SO THAT I GRASPED HIS ARM EXCLAIMING FIERCELY SPEAK ENGLISH WHERE IS MY FATHER I COULD HARDLY SEE HIS FACE BUT THERE WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO TELL THAT HE TURNED TOWARDS ME AND HE STOPPED SPEAKING
2093-143264-0039 AND SEEMED TO BE ENDEAVOURING TO COMPREHEND WHAT I SAID MY FATHER THE PRISONER I SAID AGAIN WITH MY LIPS NOW TO HIS EAR PRISONER
2093-143264-0040 THE CHIEF'S HUT HE BEGAN SPEAKING AGAIN VOLUBLY AND THEN STOPPED AND BENT HIS HEAD AT THE CHIEF'S HUT SAID THE DOCTOR EXCITEDLY WAIT A MOMENT OR TWO TO GIVE HIM TIME TO COLLECT HIMSELF THEN ASK HIM AGAIN
2093-143264-0041 THE POOR DAZED CREATURE TURNED TO THE DOCTOR NOW AND BENT TOWARDS HIM HOLDING HIM BY THE ARM THIS TIME CHIEF'S HUT YES RIGHT ACROSS
2093-143264-0042 HE POINTED IN THE DIRECTION THE SAVAGES SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN AND FROM WHENCE WE COULD HEAR THE VOICES RISING AND FALLING IN BUSY SPEECH MY HEART LEAPED FOR WE KNEW NOW DEFINITELY WHERE HE WHOM WE SOUGHT WAS KEPT
2093-143271-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY NINE HOW WE TOOK A LAST LOOK ROUND AND FOUND IT WAS TIME TO GO THAT NEXT EVENING SEEMED AS IT WOULD NEVER COME
2093-143271-0001 IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT WE DID FOR JUST AS IT WAS GROWING DUSK AFTER A GOOD LOOK ROUND WE WERE ABOUT TO CROSS THE RIVULET AND GO THROUGH THE CAVERN AND UP THE RIFT BACK INTO CAMP WHEN I CAUGHT THE DOCTOR'S ARM WITHOUT A WORD
2093-143271-0002 HE STARTED AND LOOKED IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS I DID WHICH WAS RIGHT DOWN THE GULLY AND SAW WHAT HAD TAKEN MY ATTENTION NAMELY THE STOOPING BODIES OF A COUPLE OF BLACKS HURRYING AWAY THROUGH THE BUSHES AT A PRETTY GOOD RATE
2093-143271-0003 AND THEY'LL COME BACK WITH A LOT OF THEIR WARRIORS TO ATTACK US TO NIGHT AND FIND US GONE AND WHILE THEY ARE GONE JOE WE WILL ATTACK THEIR PLACE AND CARRY OFF OUR PRIZE
2093-143271-0004 AND AS WE ENTERED I LOOKED ROUND AGAIN TO CATCH SIGHT OF ANOTHER BLACK FIGURE CROUCHING FAR UP THE OPPOSITE BANK AT THE FOOT OF A GREAT TREE I DID NOT SPEAK FOR IT WAS BETTER THAT THE BLACK SHOULD NOT THINK HE HAD BEEN SEEN
2093-143271-0005 SO FOLLOWED THE DOCTOR INTO THE CAVE CLIMBED THE RIFT WITH HIM
2093-143271-0006 SMELL UM BLACK FELLOW ONE EYE PEEPING ROUND UM TREES YES WE HAVE SEEN THEM TOO I SAID
2093-143271-0007 GLIDING SILENTLY THROUGH THE FOREST FOR QUITE THREE HOURS WHEN MISTER FRANCIS STOPPED AND IT WAS DECIDED TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES A LITTLE BEFORE PROCEEDING FARTHER THE DOCTOR HAD SETTLED
2093-143271-0008 IF YOU GO ALONE YOU WILL LOSE TIME AND YOUR EXPEDITION MAY HE STOPPED SHORT AND LAY DOWN UPON THE EARTH FOR A FEW MINUTES DURING WHICH THE DOCTOR REMAINED UNDECIDED
2093-143271-0009 AT LAST HE BENT DOWN AND WHISPERED A FEW WORDS TO HIS PATIENT WHO IMMEDIATELY ROSE ORDERS WERE THEN GIVEN TO THE BLACKS WHO WERE TO STAY UNDER THE COMMAND OF JACK PENNY AND FOLLOWED BY JIMMY
2093-143271-0010 AND STEPPING MORE CAUTIOUSLY WE WERE SOON CLOSE UP BEHIND A GREAT HUT THIS IS THE PLACE WHISPERED MISTER FRANCIS HE IS KEPT PRISONER HERE OR ELSE AT THE GREAT HUT ON THE OTHER SIDE HIST
2093-143271-0011 I'LL CREEP FORWARD AND LISTEN HE WENT DOWN IN A STOOPING POSITION AND DISAPPEARED LEAVING US LISTENING TO THE CONTINUOUS TALK OF EVIDENTLY A NUMEROUS PARTY OF THE SAVAGES
2093-143271-0012 AND SO LIKE DID IT ALL SEEM TO THE LAST TIME THAT NO TIME MIGHT HAVE ELAPSED SINCE WE CROUCHED THERE BREATHING HEAVILY WITH EXCITEMENT
2093-143271-0013 I WHISPERED ONCE OR TWICE TO THE DOCTOR BUT HE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY LIPS I TURNED TO JIMMY BUT HE HAD CROUCHED DOWN AND WAS RESTING HIMSELF ACCORDING TO HIS HABIT
2093-143271-0014 AND SO QUITE AN HOUR PASSED AWAY BEFORE WE WERE AWARE BY A SLIGHT RUSTLE THAT MISTER FRANCIS WAS BACK LOOMING UP OUT OF THE DARKNESS LIKE SOME GIANT SO STRANGELY DID THE OBSCURITY
2093-143271-0015 DISTORT EVERYTHING NEAR AT HAND HERE HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE AND BENDING DOWN WE ALL LISTENED TO HIS WORDS WHICH CAME FEEBLY CONSEQUENT UPON HIS EXERTIONS I HAVE BEEN TO THE FAR HUT
2093-143271-0016 AND THEN HE MUTTERED SOMETHING IN THE SAVAGES TONGUE AND THEN BROKE DOWN AND BEGAN TO SOB TAKE NO NOTICE THE DOCTOR WHISPERED TO ME AS I STOOD TREMBLING THERE FEELING AS I DID THAT I WAS ONLY A FEW YARDS
2093-143271-0017 FROM HIM WE HAD COME TO SAVE AND WHO WAS LYING BOUND THERE WAITING FOR THE HELP THAT SEEMED AS IF IT WOULD NEVER COME THE DOCTOR REALISED MY FEELINGS FOR HE CAME A LITTLE CLOSER AND PRESSED MY HAND
2093-143271-0018 DON'T BE DOWNHEARTED MY LAD HE WHISPERED
2093-143271-0019 THAN WHEN WE STARTED YES I SAID BUT BUT NONSENSE BOY WHY WE'VE FOUND YOUR FATHER WE KNOW WHERE HE IS AND IF WE CAN'T GET HIM AWAY BY STRATAGEM
2093-143271-0020 WE'LL GO TO ANOTHER TRIBE OF THE BLACKS MAKE FRIENDS WITH THEM AND GET THEM TO FIGHT ON OUR SIDE NONSENSE DOCTOR I SAID BITTERLY YOU ARE ONLY SAYING THIS TO COMFORT ME TO GET YOU TO ACT LIKE A MAN HE SAID SHARPLY
2093-143271-0021 AND TO SET MY BRAIN AT WORK SCHEMING IT SEEMED TO GROW DARKER JUST THEN THE STARS FADING OUT BEHIND A THICK VEIL OF CLOUDS AND CREEPING NEARER TO THE DOCTOR I SAT DOWN BESIDE WHERE HE KNELT
2093-143271-0022 LISTENING TO THE INCESSANT TALKING OF THE SAVAGES
2093-143271-0023 AND NOW RISING INTO QUITE AN ANGRY SHOUT NOW DESCENDING INTO A LOW BUZZ THE TALK TALK TALK WENT ON AS IF THEY WERE SAYING THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
2093-143271-0024 AND ALL THIS WHILE THE TALKING WENT ON RISING AND FALLING TILL IT SEEMED ALMOST MADDENING TO HEAR WE MUST HAVE WAITED THERE QUITE A COUPLE OF HOURS AND STILL THERE WAS NO CHANGE
2093-143271-0025 AT LAST HE CREPT FROM ME TO SPEAK TO MISTER FRANCIS IT IS OF NO USE TO STAY LONGER I'M AFRAID MY LAD HE WHISPERED UNLESS WE WAIT AND SEE WHETHER THE HUT IS LEFT EMPTY WHEN THE EXPEDITION PARTY COMES BACK
2093-143271-0026 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THEN I SAID ASK FRANCIS TO SUGGEST A BETTER HIDING PLACE FOR US WHERE WE CAN GO TO NIGHT AND WAIT FOR ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY I SIGHED
2093-143271-0027 FOR I WAS WEARY OF WAITING FOR OPPORTUNITIES FAST ASLEEP POOR FELLOW HE WHISPERED COMING BACK SO SILENTLY THAT HE STARTLED ME WHERE'S THE BLACK
2093-143271-0028 I TURNED SHARPLY TO WHERE JIMMY HAD BEEN CURLED UP BUT HE WAS GONE I CREPT A LITTLE WAY IN TWO OR THREE DIRECTIONS BUT HE WAS NOT WITH US AND I SAID SO HOW
2093-143271-0029 DARE HE GO THE DOCTOR SAID ANGRILY HE WILL RUIN OUR PLANS WHAT'S THAT GYP I SAID AS THE DOG CREPT UP TO US AND THRUST HIS HEAD AGAINST MY HAND JACK PENNY IS GETTING ANXIOUS
2093-143271-0030 IT IS A SIGNAL FOR US TO COME BACK HOW DO YOU KNOW WE AGREED UPON IT I SAID HE WAS TO SEND THE DOG IN SEARCH OF US IF WE DID NOT JOIN HIM IN TWO HOURS AND IF WE WERE IN TROUBLE
2093-143271-0031 I WAS EITHER TO TIE SOMETHING TO HIS COLLAR OR TAKE IT OFF DO NEITHER SAID THE DOCTOR QUIETLY LOOK THEY ARE LIGHTING A FIRE THE OTHERS MUST HAVE COME BACK
2093-143271-0032 I TURNED AND SAW A FAINT GLOW AWAY OVER THE RIGHT CORNER OF THE HUT AND THEN THERE WAS A SHOUT AND THE SHRILL CRIES OF SOME WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN A MOMENT THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS EXCITEMENT IN THE HUT BEFORE US
2093-143271-0033 THE SAVAGES SWARMING OUT LIKE ANGRY BEES AND ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT THE WHOLE SHAPE OF THE GREAT LONG HUT STOOD OUT AGAINST THE SKY THE VILLAGE IS ON FIRE WHISPERED THE DOCTOR BACK MY BOY FRANCIS QUICK
2093-143271-0034 MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN RUNNING TO AND FRO AS IF WILD NOW WOULD BE THE TIME SAID THE DOCTOR WE MIGHT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CONFUSION AND GET YOUR FATHER AWAY YES I CRIED EXCITEDLY
2093-143271-0035 I'M READY STOP FOR YOUR LIVES SAID A VOICE AT OUR ELBOW AND TURNING I SAW MISTER FRANCIS WITH HIS SWARTHY FACE LIT UP BY THE FIRE YOU COULD NOT GET NEAR THE HUT NOW WITHOUT BEING SEEN
2093-143271-0036 IF YOU HAD ACTED AT THE MOMENT THE ALARM BEGAN YOU MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED IT IS NOW TOO LATE NO NO I CRIED LET US TRY
2093-143271-0037 THE VILLAGE IS ON FIRE AND THE BLACKS MUST SEE YOU IF YOU ARE TAKEN NOW YOU WILL BE KILLED WITHOUT MERCY WE MUST RISK IT I SAID EXCITEDLY STEPPING FORWARD AND YOUR FATHER TOO I RECOILED
2093-143271-0038 GO ON THEN I SAID WITH A GROAN OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND MISTER FRANCIS TOOK THE LEAD ONCE MORE AND THE DOCTOR FOLLOWING I WAS LAST BUT JIMMY I SAID
2093-143271-0039 STOOD UP CLEARLY BEFORE US AND WE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN GOING ON I FOLLOWED MORE RELUCTANTLY WHEN I REMEMBERED GYP AND CHIRRUPED TO HIM EXPECTING TO FIND HIM AT MY HEELS BUT HE WAS NOT THERE
2093-143271-0040 HE HAS GONE ON IN FRONT I THOUGHT AND ONCE MORE I TRAMPED WEARILY ON
2110-161100-0000 HERR STEIN IS COMPLETELY DAFT ON THE SUBJECT OF HIS DAUGHTER SHE IS EIGHT YEARS OLD AND LEARNS EVERYTHING BY HEART SOMETHING MAY COME OF HER FOR SHE HAS TALENT BUT NOT IF SHE GOES ON AS SHE IS DOING NOW
2110-161100-0001 SHE WILL NEVER ACQUIRE VELOCITY BECAUSE SHE PURPOSELY MAKES HER HAND HEAVY SHE WILL NEVER LEARN THE MOST NECESSARY MOST DIFFICULT AND PRINCIPAL THING IN MUSIC THAT IS TIME
2110-161100-0002 BECAUSE FROM CHILDHOOD SHE HAS DESIGNEDLY CULTIVATED THE HABIT OF IGNORING THE BEAT AUGSBURG
2110-161100-0003 SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO HIS FATHER
2110-161100-0004 WHO WAS SCHILLER'S COMPANION IN HIS FLIGHT TO FRANCONIA AS FRAU STREICHER SHE BECAME BEETHOVEN'S FAITHFUL FRIEND AND FREQUENTLY TOOK IT UPON HERSELF TO STRAIGHTEN OUT HIS DOMESTIC AFFAIRS
2110-161100-0005 FIFTY ONE IF SHE DOES NOT GET SOME THOUGHTS AND IDEAS FOR NOW SHE HAS ABSOLUTELY NONE IT WILL ALL BE IN VAIN FOR GOD KNOWS I CAN NOT GIVE HER ANY
2110-161100-0006 IT IS NOT HER FATHER'S INTENTION TO MAKE A GREAT COMPOSER OUT OF HER SHE SHALL HE SAYS NOT WRITE ANY OPERAS OR ARIAS OR SYMPHONIES BUT ONLY GREAT SONATAS FOR HER INSTRUMENT AND MINE
2110-161100-0007 I GAVE HER HER FOURTH LESSON TODAY AND SO FAR AS THE RULES OF COMPOSITION AND HER EXERCISES ARE CONCERNED I AM PRETTY WELL SATISFIED WITH HER SHE WROTE A VERY GOOD BASS TO THE FIRST MINUET WHICH I SET HER
2110-161100-0008 UNFORTUNATELY SHE HAS NONE SHE MUST BE TAUGHT ARTIFICIALLY SHE HAS NO IDEAS THERE ARE NO RESULTS I HAVE TRIED IN EVERY SORT OF WAY AMONG OTHER THINGS IT OCCURRED TO ME TO WRITE DOWN
2110-161100-0009 A VERY SIMPLE MINUET AND TO SEE IF SHE COULD WRITE A VARIATION ON IT IN VAIN WELL THOUGHT I IT IS BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO BEGIN I THEN BEGAN A VARIATION OF THE FIRST MEASURE AND TOLD HER TO CONTINUE IT
2110-161100-0010 IN THE SAME MANNER THAT WENT FAIRLY WELL WHEN SHE HAD MADE AN END I ASKED HER TO BEGIN SOMETHING OF HER OWN ONLY THE FIRST VOICE A MELODY
2110-161100-0011 NOW LOOK WHAT AN ASS I AM I HAVE BEGUN A MINUET AND CAN'T FINISH EVEN THE FIRST PART BE GOOD ENOUGH TO FINISH IT FOR ME SHE THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE AT LENGTH SHE PRODUCED A LITTLE SOMETHING TO MY JOY
2110-161100-0012 THEN I MADE HER FINISH THE MINUET
2110-161100-0013 FOR HER HOME WORK I HAVE GIVEN HER NOTHING TO DO EXCEPT TO ALTER MY FOUR MEASURES AND MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF THEM TO INVENT ANOTHER BEGINNING TO KEEP TO THE HARMONY IF SHE MUST BUT TO WRITE A NEW MELODY WE SHALL SEE WHAT COMES OF IT
2110-161100-0014 TOMORROW PARIS MAY FOURTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER THE PUPIL WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE DUKE DE GUINES AN EXCELLENT FLAUTIST

2110-161100-0016 WAS ANYTHING BUT A NOBLEMAN FIFTY TWO THE ANDANTE IS GOING TO GIVE US THE MOST TROUBLE FOR IT IS FULL OF EXPRESSION AND MUST BE PLAYED WITH TASTE
2110-161100-0017 AND ACCURATELY AS WRITTEN IN THE MATTER OF FORTE AND PIANO SHE IS VERY CLEVER AND LEARNS QUICKLY THE RIGHT HAND IS VERY GOOD BUT THE LEFT UTTERLY RUINED I CAN SAY THAT I OFTEN PITY HER
2110-161100-0018 AND HER THAT IF I WERE HER REGULAR TEACHER I WOULD LOCK UP ALL HER MUSIC COVER THE KEYBOARD WITH A HANDKERCHIEF AND MAKE HER PRACTICE BOTH HANDS AT FIRST SLOWLY ON NOTHING BUT PASSAGES TRILLS MORDENTS ET CETERA
2110-161100-0019 UNTIL THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE LEFT HAND WAS REMEDIED AFTER THAT I AM SURE I COULD MAKE A REAL CLAVIER PLAYER OUT OF HER IT IS A PITY SHE HAS SO MUCH GENIUS READS RESPECTABLY HAS A GREAT DEAL OF NATURAL FLUENCY
2110-161100-0020 AND PLAYS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF FEELING MANNHEIM NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO HIS FATHER THE PUPIL WAS ROSE CANNABICH TO WHOM THE SONATA REFERRED TO IS DEDICATED
2110-161100-0021 HER FATHER WHOM MOZART ADMIRED GREATLY AS AN ABLE CONDUCTOR WAS CHAPELMASTER OF THE EXCELLENTLY TRAINED ORCHESTRA AT MANNHEIM HE LIVED FROM SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE TO SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT
2110-161100-0022 THE ANDANTE FROM WHICH TROUBLE WAS EXPECTED WAS THAT WHICH MOZART WROTE WITH THE PURPOSE THAT IT SHOULD REFLECT THE CHARACTER OF ROSE CANNABICH A LOVELY AND AMIABLE GIRL ACCORDING TO ALL ACCOUNTS
2110-161100-0023 H E K FIFTY THREE THIS E IS VERY FORCED ONE CAN SEE THAT IT WAS WRITTEN ONLY TO GO FROM ONE CONSONANCE TO ANOTHER IN PARALLEL MOTION
2110-161100-0024 JUST AS BAD POETS WRITE NONSENSE FOR THE SAKE OF A RHYME FROM THE EXERCISE BOOK OF THE COUSIN OF ABBE STADLER WHO TOOK LESSONS IN THOROUGH BASS FROM MOZART IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR
2110-161100-0025 AND WHEN YOUR MIND WAS NOT DEVOTED TO OTHER PURSUITS YOU WOULD PERHAPS HAVE DONE WISELY BUT NOW THAT YOUR PROFESSION OF THE STAGE MUST AND OUGHT TO OCCUPY ALL YOUR ATTENTION
2110-161100-0026 IT WOULD BE AN UNWISE MEASURE TO ENTER INTO A DRY STUDY YOU MAY TAKE MY WORD FOR IT NATURE HAS MADE YOU A MELODIST AND YOU WOULD ONLY DISTURB AND PERPLEX YOURSELF REFLECT A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE IS A DANGEROUS THING
2110-161100-0027 SHOULD THERE BE ERRORS IN WHAT YOU WRITE YOU WILL FIND HUNDREDS OF MUSICIANS IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD CAPABLE OF CORRECTING THEM THEREFORE DO NOT DISTURB YOUR NATURAL GIFT TO MICHAEL KELLY THE IRISH TENOR
2110-161100-0028 TO WHOM MOZART ASSIGNED THE PARTS OF BASILIO AND DON CURZIO AT THE FIRST PERFORMANCE OF LE NOZZE DI FIGARO IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SIX KELLY HAD ASKED MOZART WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD STUDY COUNTERPOINT
2110-161100-0029 THREE YEARS LATER KELLY RETURNED TO ENGLAND BEGAN HIS CAREER AS COMPOSER OF MUSICAL PIECES FOR THE STAGE HE WAS FAIRLY PROLIFIC BUT FAILED TO IMPRESS THE PUBLIC WITH THE ORIGINALITY OF HIS CREATIVE TALENT
2110-161100-0030 HE WENT INTO THE WINE BUSINESS WHICH FACT LED SHERIDAN TO MAKE THE WITTY SUGGESTION THAT HE INSCRIBE OVER HIS SHOP MICHAEL KELLY COMPOSER OF WINES AND IMPORTER OF MUSIC HE WAS BORN IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR AND DIED
2110-161100-0031 IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX H E K FIFTY FIVE THIS IS GENERALLY THE CASE WITH ALL WHO DID NOT TASTE THE ROD OR FEEL THE TEACHER'S TONGUE WHEN BOYS
2110-161100-0032 BY MERE TALENT AND INCLINATION MANY SUCCEED FAIRLY WELL BUT WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS HAVING NONE OF THEIR OWN OTHERS WHO HAVE IDEAS OF THEIR OWN DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM THAT IS YOUR CASE
2110-161100-0033 IN A LETTER WRITTEN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE TO A NOBLE FRIEND CRITICIZING A SYMPHONY FIFTY SIX DO NOT WONDER AT ME IT WAS NOT A CAPRICE
2110-161100-0034 I NOTICED THAT MOST OF THE MUSICIANS WERE OLD MEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO END OF DRAGGING IF I HAD NOT FIRST DRIVEN THEM INTO THE FIRE AND MADE THEM ANGRY OUT OF PURE RAGE THEY DID THEIR BEST
2110-161100-0035 REPORTED BY ROCHLITZ MOZART WAS REHEARSING THE ALLEGRO OF ONE OF HIS SYMPHONIES IN LEIPSIC HE WORKED UP SUCH A FIT OF ANGER THAT HE STAMPED HIS FOOT AND BROKE ONE OF HIS SHOE LACES
2110-161100-0036 HIS ANGER FLED AND HE BROKE INTO A MERRY LAUGH FIFTY SEVEN RIGHT THAT'S THE WAY TO SHRIEK AT A REHEARSAL OF DON GIOVANNI
2110-161100-0037 THE REPRESENTATIVE OF ZERLINA DID NOT ACT REALISTICALLY ENOUGH TO SUIT MOZART THEREUPON HE WENT UNNOTICED ON THE STAGE AND AT THE REPETITION OF THE SCENE GRABBED THE SINGER SO RUDELY AND UNEXPECTEDLY
2110-161100-0038 THAT SHE INVOLUNTARILY UTTERED THE SHRIEK WHICH THE SCENE CALLED FOR
2110-161100-0039 THE PLACE PRAGUE AND THE TIME
2110-161100-0040 TWENTY NINTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
2110-161101-0000 FIFTY EIGHT HERR STEIN SEES AND HEARS THAT I AM MORE OF A PLAYER THAN BEECKE THAT WITHOUT MAKING GRIMACES OF ANY KIND I PLAY SO EXPRESSIVELY THAT ACCORDING TO HIS OWN CONFESSION
2110-161101-0001 NO ONE SHOWS OFF HIS PIANOFORTE AS WELL AS I THAT I ALWAYS REMAIN STRICTLY IN TIME SURPRISES EVERY ONE THEY CAN NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEFT HAND SHOULD NOT IN THE LEAST BE CONCERNED IN A TEMPO RUBATO
2110-161101-0002 WHEN THEY PLAY THE LEFT HAND ALWAYS FOLLOWS AUGSBURG
2110-161101-0003 SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO HIS FATHER WE HAVE HERE A SUGGESTION OF THE TEMPO RUBATO AS PLAYED BY CHOPIN ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF MIKULI
2110-161101-0004 WHO SAID THAT NO MATTER HOW FREE CHOPIN WAS EITHER IN MELODY OR ARABESQUE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND THE LEFT ALWAYS ADHERED STRICTLY TO THE TIME MOZART LEARNED THE PRINCIPLE FROM HIS FATHER
2110-161101-0005 WHO IN HIS METHOD FOR THE VIOLIN CONDEMNED THE ACCOMPANISTS WHO SPOILED THE TEMPO RUBATO OF AN ARTIST BY WAITING TO FOLLOW HIM H E K FIFTY NINE
2110-161101-0006 WHOEVER CAN SEE AND HEAR HER THE DAUGHTER OF STEIN PLAY WITHOUT LAUGHING MUST BE A STONE STEIN LIKE HER FATHER SHE SITS OPPOSITE THE TREBLE INSTEAD OF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INSTRUMENT
2110-161101-0007 SO THAT THERE MAY BE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR SWAYING ABOUT AND MAKING GRIMACES THEN SHE ROLLS UP HER EYES AND SMIRKS IF A PASSAGE OCCURS TWICE IT IS PLAYED SLOWER THE SECOND TIME
2110-161101-0008 IF THREE TIMES STILL SLOWER WHEN A PASSAGE COMES UP GOES THE ARM AND IF THERE IS TO BE AN EMPHASIS IT MUST COME FROM THE ARM HEAVILY AND CLUMSILY NOT FROM THE FINGERS
2110-161101-0009 BUT THE BEST OF ALL IS THAT WHEN THERE COMES A PASSAGE WHICH OUGHT TO FLOW LIKE OIL IN WHICH THERE NECESSARILY OCCURS A CHANGE OF FINGERS THERE IS NO NEED OF TAKING CARE WHEN THE TIME COMES YOU STOP
2110-161101-0010 LIFT THE HAND AND NONCHALANTLY BEGIN AGAIN THIS HELPS ONE THE BETTER TO CATCH A FALSE NOTE AND THE EFFECT IS FREQUENTLY CURIOUS AUGSBURG
2110-161101-0011 SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE LETTER IS TO HIS FATHER AND THE YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE PLAYING IS CRITICIZED IS THE LITTLE MISS OF EIGHT YEARS NANETTE STEIN SIXTY
2110-161101-0012 WHEN I TOLD HERR STEIN THAT I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY ON HIS ORGAN AND THAT I WAS PASSIONATELY FOND OF THE INSTRUMENT HE MARVELED GREATLY AND SAID WHAT A MAN LIKE YOU SO GREAT A CLAVIER PLAYER
2110-161101-0013 NO EXPRESSION NEITHER PIANO NOR FORTE BUT GOES ON ALWAYS THE SAME BUT ALL THAT SIGNIFIES NOTHING TO ME THE ORGAN IS NEVERTHELESS THE KING OF INSTRUMENTS AUGSBURG OCTOBER SEVENTEENTH
2110-161101-0014 SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO HIS FATHER SIXTY ONE I HAD THE PLEASURE TO HEAR HERR FRANZL WHOSE WIFE IS A SISTER OF MADAME CANNABICH PLAY A CONCERTO ON THE VIOLIN
2110-161101-0015 HE PLEASES ME GREATLY YOU KNOW THAT I AM NO GREAT LOVER OF DIFFICULTIES HE PLAYS DIFFICULT THINGS BUT ONE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE DIFFICULT BUT IMAGINES THAT ONE
2110-161101-0016 COULD DO THE SAME THING AT ONCE THAT IS TRUE ART HE ALSO HAS A BEAUTIFUL ROUND TONE NOT A NOTE IS MISSING ONE HEARS EVERYTHING EVERYTHING IS WELL MARKED HE HAS A FINE STACCATO BOW
2110-161101-0017 UP AS WELL AS DOWN AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD SO GOOD A DOUBLE SHAKE AS HIS IN A WORD THOUGH HE IS NO WIZARD HE IS A SOLID VIOLINIST
2110-161101-0018 SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO HIS FATHER SIXTY TWO WHEREIN CONSISTS THE ART OF PLAYING PRIMA VISTA IN THIS TO PLAY IN THE PROPER TEMPO
2110-161101-0019 JANUARY SEVENTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER
2110-161101-0020 I AM AT HERR VON AURNHAMMER'S AFTER DINNER NEARLY EVERY DAY THE YOUNG WOMAN IS A FRIGHT BUT SHE PLAYS RAVISHINGLY
2110-161101-0021 SHE IS TOO JERKY VIENNA JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE TO HIS FATHER BEETHOVEN FOUND THE SAME FAULT WITH MOZART'S PLAYING THAT MOZART HERE CONDEMNS
2110-161101-0022 SIXTY FOUR HERR RICHTER PLAYS MUCH AND WELL SO FAR AS EXECUTION IS CONCERNED BUT AS YOU WILL HEAR CRUDELY LABORIOUSLY AND WITHOUT TASTE OR FEELING
2110-161101-0023 HE IS ONE OF THE BEST FELLOWS IN THE WORLD AND WITHOUT A PARTICLE OF VANITY WHENEVER I PLAYED FOR HIM HE LOOKED IMMOVABLY AT MY FINGERS AND ONE DAY HE SAID MY GOD
2110-161101-0024 HOW I AM OBLIGED TO TORMENT MYSELF AND SWEAT AND YET WITHOUT OBTAINING APPLAUSE AND FOR YOU MY FRIEND IT IS MERE PLAY YES SAID I I HAD TO LABOR ONCE IN ORDER NOT TO SHOW LABOR NOW
2110-161101-0025 VIENNA APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR TO HIS FATHER IN SALZBURG WHITHER THE PIANIST RICHTER WHOM HE RECOMMENDS TO HIS FATHER IS GOING ON A CONCERT TRIP
2110-161101-0026 SIXTY FIVE MEISSNER AS YOU KNOW HAS THE BAD HABIT OF PURPOSELY MAKING HIS VOICE TREMBLE MARKING THUS ENTIRE QUARTER AND EIGHTH NOTES I NEVER COULD ENDURE IT IN HIM
2110-161101-0027 IT IS INDEED DESPICABLE AND CONTRARY TO ALL NATURALNESS IN SONG TRUE THE HUMAN VOICE TREMBLES OF ITSELF BUT ONLY IN A DEGREE THAT REMAINS BEAUTIFUL IT IS IN THE NATURE OF THE VOICE
2110-161101-0028 BUT AS SOON AS YOU OVERSTEP THE LIMIT IT IS NO LONGER BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE IT IS CONTRARY TO NATURE PARIS JUNE TWELFTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER
2110-161101-0029 THE STATEMENT THAT THE TREMOLO EFFECT COULD BE IMITATED ON THE CLAVIER SEEMS TO REQUIRE AN EXPLANATION MOZART OBVIOUSLY HAD IN VIEW NOT THE PIANOFORTE WHICH WAS JUST COMING INTO USE IN HIS DAY
2110-161101-0030 BUT THE CLAVICHORD THIS INSTRUMENT WAS SOUNDED BY STRIKING THE STRINGS WITH BITS OF BRASS PLACED IN THE FARTHER END OF THE KEYS
2110-161101-0031 THE TANGENTS AS THEY WERE CALLED HAD TO BE HELD AGAINST THE STRINGS AS LONG AS IT WAS DESIRED THAT THE TONE SHOULD SOUND AND BY GENTLY REPEATING THE PRESSURE ON THE KEY
2110-161101-0032 A TREMULOUSNESS WAS IMPARTED TO THE TONE WHICH MADE THE CLAVICHORD A MORE EXPRESSIVE INSTRUMENT THAN THE HARPSICHORD OR THE EARLY PIANOFORTE
2110-161101-0033 AND BALANCEMENT IN FRENCH H E K SIXTY SIX BEFORE DINNER HERR VOGLER DASHED THROUGH MY SONATA PRIMA VISTA HE PLAYED THE FIRST MOVEMENT
2110-161101-0034 WITH A VENGEANCE AS A RULE HE PLAYED A DIFFERENT BASS THAN THE ONE I HAD WRITTEN AND OCCASIONALLY HE CHANGED THE HARMONY AS WELL AS THE MELODY
2110-161101-0035 THE EYES CAN NOT FOLLOW NOR THE HANDS GRASP THE MUSIC SUCH PLAYING AT SIGHT AND ARE ALL ONE TO ME THE HEARERS I MEAN THOSE WORTHY OF THE NAME CAN SAY NOTHING MORE
2110-161101-0036 YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IT WAS ALL THE MORE UNENDURABLE BECAUSE I DID NOT DARE TO SAY TO HIM MUCH TOO QUICK MOREOVER IT IS MUCH EASIER TO PLAY RAPIDLY THAN SLOWLY YOU CAN DROP A FEW NOTES IN PASSAGES WITHOUT ANY ONE NOTICING IT
2110-161101-0037 BUT IS IT BEAUTIFUL AT SUCH SPEED YOU CAN USE THE HANDS INDISCRIMINATELY BUT IS THAT BEAUTIFUL MANNHEIM JANUARY SEVENTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER
2110-161101-0038 SIXTY SEVEN
2110-161101-0039 TRILL OR PILE ON THE ADORNMENTS BECAUSE THEY CAN NEITHER STUDY NOR SUSTAIN A TONE
2110-161101-0040 AH IF THERE IS NO FIRE IN THE COMPOSITION YOU WILL SURELY NEVER GET IT IN BY HURRYING IT
2110-161102-0000 SIXTY NINE WE WISH THAT IT WERE IN OUR POWER TO INTRODUCE THE GERMAN TASTE IN MINUETS IN ITALY MINUETS HERE LAST ALMOST AS LONG AS WHOLE SYMPHONIES
2110-161102-0001 TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTER MOZART AS A LAD WAS MAKING A TOUR THROUGH ITALY WITH HIS FATHER THERE MIGHT BE A VALUABLE HINT HERE TOUCHING THE PROPER TEMPO FOR THE MINUETS IN MOZART'S SYMPHONIES
2110-161102-0002 MOZART HIMSELF WAS PLAINLY OF ANOTHER OPINION H E K SEVENTY BEECKE TOLD ME AND IT IS TRUE
2110-161102-0003 THAT MUSIC IS NOW PLAYED IN THE CABINET OF THE EMPEROR
2110-161102-0004 THEN I THOUGHT TO MYSELF YES SUCH A SHALLOW PATE AS YOU FEELS A PAIN AS SOON AS HE HEARS SOMETHING WHICH HE CAN NOT UNDERSTAND MANNHEIM NOVEMBER THIRTEENTH
2110-161102-0005 SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO HIS FATHER BEECKE WAS A CONCEITED PIANIST SEVENTY ONE NOTHING GIVES ME SO MUCH PLEASURE IN THE ANTICIPATION
2110-161102-0007 THAT IS TO SAY CHORUSES AND I AM RIGHT GLAD THAT THE FRENCHMEN ARE FOND OF THEM HERETOFORE PARIS HAS BEEN USED TO THE CHORUSES OF GLUCK DEPEND ON ME
2110-161102-0008 MANNHEIM FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER ON MARCH SEVENTH HE WRITES I HAVE CENTERED ALL MY HOPES ON PARIS
2110-161102-0009 FOR THE GERMAN PRINCES ARE ALL NIGGARDS SEVENTY TWO I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER OR NOT MY SYMPHONY PLEASES AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I DON'T MUCH CARE
2110-161102-0010 WHOM SHOULD IT PLEASE I WARRANT IT WILL PLEASE THE FEW SENSIBLE FRENCHMEN WHO ARE HERE AND THERE WILL BE NO GREAT MISFORTUNE IF IT FAILS TO PLEASE THE STUPIDS
2110-161102-0011 STILL I HAVE SOME HOPE THAT THE ASSES TOO WILL FIND SOMETHING IN IT TO THEIR LIKING PARIS JUNE TWELFTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER
2110-161102-0012 SEVENTY THREE THE MOST OF THE SYMPHONIES ARE NOT TO THE LOCAL TASTE IF I FIND TIME I SHALL REVISE A FEW VIOLIN CONCERTOS SHORTEN THEM FOR OUR TASTE IN GERMANY IS FOR LONG THINGS
2110-161102-0013 AS A MATTER OF FACT SHORT AND GOOD IS BETTER PARIS SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER IN SALZBURG IN THE SAME LETTER HE SAYS
2110-161102-0014 THAT IS TO SAY IN THE MATTER OF COMPOSITION SEVENTY FOUR
2110-161102-0015 IT IS ABOMINABLE GERMAN IS DIVINE IN COMPARISON AND THEN THE SINGERS MEN AND WOMEN THEY ARE UNMENTIONABLE THEY DO NOT SING THEY SHRIEK THEY HOWL WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT THROUGH THROAT NOSE AND GULLET
2110-161102-0016 PARIS JULY NINTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER MOZART WAS THINKING OF WRITING A FRENCH OPERA SEVENTY FIVE
2110-161102-0017 AH IF WE TOO HAD CLARINETS YOU CAN'T CONCEIVE WHAT A WONDERFUL EFFECT A SYMPHONY WITH FLUTES OBOES AND CLARINETS MAKES AT THE FIRST AUDIENCE WITH THE ARCHBISHOP I SHALL HAVE MUCH TO TELL HIM AND
2110-161102-0018 PROBABLY A FEW SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE ALAS OUR MUSIC MIGHT BE MUCH BETTER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL IF ONLY THE ARCHBISHOP WERE WILLING
2110-161102-0019 TO HIS FATHER MOZART WAS ON HIS RETURN TO SALZBURG WHERE HE HAD RECEIVED AN APPOINTMENT IN THE ARCHIEPISCOPAL CHAPEL IT SEEMS THAT WOOD WIND INSTRUMENTS WERE STILL ABSENT FROM THE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA IN SALZBURG
2110-161102-0020 SEVENTY SIX OTHERS KNOW AS WELL AS YOU AND I THAT TASTES ARE CONTINUALLY CHANGING AND THAT THE CHANGES EXTEND EVEN INTO CHURCH MUSIC
2110-161102-0021 THIS SHOULD NOT BE BUT IT ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT THAT TRUE CHURCH MUSIC IS NOW FOUND ONLY IN THE ATTIC AND ALMOST EATEN UP BY THE WORMS VIENNA APRIL TWELFTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE
2110-161102-0022 TO HIS FATHER WHO WAS ACTIVE AS COURT CHAPELMASTER IN SALZBURG AND WHO HAD BEEN ASKED BY HIS SON IN THE SAME LETTER WHEN IT GREW A LITTLE WARMER TO LOOK IN THE ATTIC AND SEND SOME OF YOUR HIS CHURCH MUSIC
2110-161102-0023 SEVENTY SEVEN THE THEMES PLEASED ME MOST IN THE SYMPHONY YET IT WILL BE THE LEAST EFFECTIVE FOR THERE IS TOO MUCH IN IT AND A FRAGMENTARY PERFORMANCE OF IT SOUNDS LIKE AN ANT HILL LOOKS
2110-161102-0024 THAT IS AS IF THE DEVIL HAD BEEN TURNED LOOSE IN IT IN A LETTER WRITTEN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE TO A NOBLEMAN WHO WAS A COMPOSER AND HAD SUBMITTED A SYMPHONY TO MOZART FOR CRITICISM
2110-161102-0025 SEVENTY EIGHT SO FAR AS MELODY IS CONCERNED YES FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT NO MOREOVER THE SCORES WHICH YOU MAY SEE HERE OUTSIDE THOSE OF
2110-161102-0026 AND THERE IS NOTHING FRENCH ABOUT THEM EXCEPT THE WORDS
2110-161102-0027 WHOM MOZART FREQUENTLY FOUND OCCUPIED WITH FRENCH SCORES AND WHO HAD ASKED WHETHER THE STUDY OF ITALIAN SCORES WERE NOT PREFERABLE SEVENTY NINE THE ODE IS ELEVATED
2110-161102-0028 BEAUTIFUL EVERYTHING YOU WISH BUT TOO EXAGGERATED AND BOMBASTIC FOR MY EARS BUT WHAT WOULD YOU THE GOLDEN MEAN THE TRUTH IS NO LONGER RECOGNIZED OR VALUED TO WIN APPLAUSE ONE MUST WRITE STUFF SO SIMPLE
2110-161102-0029 THAT A COACHMAN MIGHT SING IT AFTER YOU OR SO INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT IT PLEASES SIMPLY BECAUSE NO SENSIBLE MAN CAN COMPREHEND IT BUT IT IS NOT THIS THAT I WANTED TO DISCUSS WITH YOU BUT ANOTHER MATTER I HAVE A STRONG DESIRE TO WRITE A BOOK
2110-161102-0030 A LITTLE WORK ON MUSICAL CRITICISM WITH ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES N B NOT UNDER MY NAME VIENNA DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO TO HIS FATHER
2110-161102-0031 A BARDIC SONG BY DENIS ON GIBRALTAR IT IS A SECRET FOR A HUNGARIAN LADY WANTS THUS TO HONOR DENIS
2110-161102-0032 THE LITTLE BOOK OF CRITICISM NEVER APPEARED EIGHTY THE ORCHESTRA IN BERLIN CONTAINS THE GREATEST AGGREGATION OF VIRTUOSI IN THE WORLD
2110-161102-0033 I NEVER HEARD SUCH QUARTET PLAYING AS HERE BUT WHEN ALL THE GENTLEMEN ARE TOGETHER THEY MIGHT DO BETTER
2110-161102-0034 IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE WHEN ASKED FOR AN OPINION ON THE ORCHESTRA IN BERLIN THE KING ASKED MOZART TO TRANSFER HIS SERVICES TO THE COURT AT BERLIN MOZART REPLIED
2113-132484-0000 THE FACT WAS THAT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED SUCH AN ENDING HE HAD BEEN OVERBEARING TO THE LAST DEGREE NEVER DREAMING THAT TWO DESTITUTE AND DEFENCELESS WOMEN COULD ESCAPE FROM HIS CONTROL THIS CONVICTION WAS STRENGTHENED BY HIS VANITY AND CONCEIT A CONCEIT TO THE POINT OF FATUITY
2113-132484-0001 PYOTR PETROVITCH WHO HAD MADE HIS WAY UP FROM INSIGNIFICANCE WAS MORBIDLY GIVEN TO SELF ADMIRATION HAD THE HIGHEST OPINION OF HIS INTELLIGENCE AND CAPACITIES AND SOMETIMES EVEN GLOATED IN SOLITUDE OVER HIS IMAGE IN THE GLASS
2113-132484-0002 BUT WHAT HE LOVED AND VALUED ABOVE ALL WAS THE MONEY HE HAD AMASSED BY HIS LABOUR AND BY ALL SORTS OF DEVICES THAT MONEY MADE HIM THE EQUAL OF ALL WHO HAD BEEN HIS SUPERIORS
2113-132484-0003 PYOTR PETROVITCH HAD SPOKEN WITH PERFECT SINCERITY AND HAD INDEED FELT GENUINELY INDIGNANT AT SUCH BLACK INGRATITUDE AND YET WHEN HE MADE DOUNIA HIS OFFER HE WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE GROUNDLESSNESS OF ALL THE GOSSIP
2113-132484-0004 THE STORY HAD BEEN EVERYWHERE CONTRADICTED BY MARFA PETROVNA AND WAS BY THEN DISBELIEVED BY ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE
2113-132484-0005 YET HE STILL THOUGHT HIGHLY OF HIS OWN RESOLUTION IN LIFTING DOUNIA TO HIS LEVEL AND REGARDED IT AS SOMETHING HEROIC IN SPEAKING OF IT TO DOUNIA
2113-132484-0006 DOUNIA WAS SIMPLY ESSENTIAL TO HIM TO DO WITHOUT HER WAS UNTHINKABLE
2113-132484-0007 BUT HE HAD GONE ON WAITING AND AMASSING MONEY HE BROODED WITH RELISH IN PROFOUND SECRET OVER THE IMAGE OF A GIRL VIRTUOUS POOR SHE MUST BE POOR VERY YOUNG VERY PRETTY OF GOOD BIRTH AND EDUCATION VERY TIMID
2113-132484-0008 ONE WHO HAD SUFFERED MUCH AND WAS COMPLETELY HUMBLED BEFORE HIM ONE WHO WOULD ALL HER LIFE LOOK ON HIM AS HER SAVIOUR WORSHIP HIM ADMIRE HIM AND ONLY HIM HOW MANY SCENES HOW MANY AMOROUS EPISODES HE HAD IMAGINED ON THIS
2113-132484-0009 SEDUCTIVE AND PLAYFUL THEME WHEN HIS WORK WAS OVER AND BEHOLD THE DREAM OF SO MANY YEARS WAS ALL BUT REALISED THE BEAUTY AND EDUCATION OF AVDOTYA ROMANOVNA HAD IMPRESSED HIM HER HELPLESS POSITION HAD BEEN A GREAT ALLUREMENT
2113-132484-0010 IN HER HE HAD FOUND EVEN MORE THAN HE DREAMED OF HERE WAS A GIRL OF PRIDE CHARACTER VIRTUE
2113-132484-0011 AND THIS CREATURE WOULD BE SLAVISHLY GRATEFUL ALL HER LIFE FOR HIS HEROIC CONDESCENSION AND WOULD HUMBLE HERSELF IN THE DUST BEFORE HIM AND HE WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTE UNBOUNDED POWER OVER HER NOT LONG BEFORE HE HAD TOO AFTER LONG REFLECTION AND HESITATION
2113-132484-0012 MADE AN IMPORTANT CHANGE IN HIS CAREER AND WAS NOW ENTERING ON A WIDER CIRCLE OF BUSINESS
2113-132484-0013 HE WAS IN FACT DETERMINED TO TRY HIS FORTUNE IN PETERSBURG HE KNEW THAT WOMEN COULD DO A VERY GREAT DEAL THE FASCINATION OF A CHARMING VIRTUOUS HIGHLY EDUCATED WOMAN MIGHT MAKE HIS WAY EASIER MIGHT DO WONDERS IN ATTRACTING PEOPLE TO HIM
2113-132484-0014 THROWING AN AUREOLE ROUND HIM AND NOW EVERYTHING WAS IN RUINS
2113-132484-0015 HAD NOT EVEN TIME TO SPEAK OUT HAD SIMPLY MADE A JOKE BEEN CARRIED AWAY AND IT HAD ENDED SO SERIOUSLY AND OF COURSE TOO HE DID LOVE DOUNIA IN HIS OWN WAY HE ALREADY POSSESSED HER IN HIS DREAMS AND ALL AT ONCE NO
2113-132484-0016 THE NEXT DAY THE VERY NEXT DAY IT MUST ALL BE SET RIGHT SMOOTHED OVER SETTLED ABOVE ALL HE MUST CRUSH THAT CONCEITED MILKSOP WHO WAS THE CAUSE OF IT ALL WITH A SICK FEELING HE COULD NOT HELP RECALLING RAZUMIHIN TOO
2113-132484-0017 BUT HE SOON REASSURED HIMSELF ON THAT SCORE AS THOUGH A FELLOW LIKE THAT COULD BE PUT ON A LEVEL WITH HIM THE MAN HE REALLY DREADED IN EARNEST WAS SVIDRIGAILOV HE HAD IN SHORT A GREAT DEAL TO ATTEND TO
2113-132484-0018 NO I I AM MORE TO BLAME THAN ANYONE SAID DOUNIA KISSING AND EMBRACING HER MOTHER I WAS TEMPTED BY HIS MONEY BUT ON MY HONOUR BROTHER I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS SUCH A BASE MAN
2113-132484-0019 DON'T BLAME ME BROTHER GOD HAS DELIVERED US GOD HAS DELIVERED US PULCHERIA ALEXANDROVNA MUTTERED BUT HALF CONSCIOUSLY AS THOUGH SCARCELY ABLE TO REALISE WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEY WERE ALL RELIEVED AND IN FIVE MINUTES THEY WERE LAUGHING
2113-132484-0020 ONLY NOW AND THEN DOUNIA TURNED WHITE AND FROWNED REMEMBERING WHAT HAD PASSED
2113-132484-0021 SHE HAD ONLY THAT MORNING THOUGHT RUPTURE WITH LUZHIN A TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE RAZUMIHIN WAS DELIGHTED HE DID NOT YET DARE TO EXPRESS HIS JOY FULLY BUT HE WAS IN A FEVER OF EXCITEMENT AS THOUGH A TON WEIGHT HAD FALLEN OFF HIS HEART
2113-132484-0022 NOW HE HAD THE RIGHT TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO THEM TO SERVE THEM ANYTHING MIGHT HAPPEN NOW BUT HE FELT AFRAID TO THINK OF FURTHER POSSIBILITIES AND DARED NOT LET HIS IMAGINATION RANGE BUT RASKOLNIKOV SAT STILL IN THE SAME PLACE
2113-132484-0023 ALMOST SULLEN AND INDIFFERENT THOUGH HE HAD BEEN THE MOST INSISTENT ON GETTING RID OF LUZHIN HE SEEMED NOW THE LEAST CONCERNED AT WHAT HAD HAPPENED DOUNIA COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT HE WAS STILL ANGRY WITH HER AND PULCHERIA ALEXANDROVNA WATCHED HIM TIMIDLY
2113-132484-0024 WHAT DID SVIDRIGAILOV SAY TO YOU SAID DOUNIA APPROACHING HIM YES YES CRIED PULCHERIA ALEXANDROVNA RASKOLNIKOV RAISED HIS HEAD
2113-132484-0025 HE WANTS TO MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF TEN THOUSAND ROUBLES AND HE DESIRES TO SEE YOU ONCE IN MY PRESENCE SEE HER ON NO ACCOUNT CRIED PULCHERIA ALEXANDROVNA AND HOW DARE HE OFFER HER MONEY
2113-132484-0026 THEN RASKOLNIKOV REPEATED RATHER DRYLY HIS CONVERSATION WITH SVIDRIGAILOV OMITTING HIS ACCOUNT OF THE GHOSTLY VISITATIONS OF MARFA PETROVNA WISHING TO AVOID ALL UNNECESSARY TALK WHAT ANSWER DID YOU GIVE HIM ASKED DOUNIA
2113-132484-0027 AT FIRST I SAID I WOULD NOT TAKE ANY MESSAGE TO YOU THEN HE SAID THAT HE WOULD DO HIS UTMOST TO OBTAIN AN INTERVIEW WITH YOU WITHOUT MY HELP HE ASSURED ME THAT HIS PASSION FOR YOU WAS A PASSING INFATUATION NOW HE HAS NO FEELING FOR YOU
2113-132484-0028 HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MARRY LUZHIN HIS TALK WAS ALTOGETHER RATHER MUDDLED HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN HIM TO YOURSELF RODYA HOW DID HE STRIKE YOU
2113-132484-0029 NO DOUBT HE HAS A MOTIVE AND PROBABLY A BAD ONE
2113-132484-0030 OF COURSE I REFUSED THIS MONEY ON YOUR ACCOUNT ONCE FOR ALL ALTOGETHER I THOUGHT HIM VERY STRANGE ONE MIGHT ALMOST THINK HE WAS MAD BUT I MAY BE MISTAKEN THAT MAY ONLY BE THE PART HE ASSUMES
2113-132484-0031 THE DEATH OF MARFA PETROVNA SEEMS TO HAVE MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION ON HIM GOD REST HER SOUL EXCLAIMED PULCHERIA ALEXANDROVNA
2113-132484-0032 IT'S AS THOUGH IT HAD FALLEN FROM HEAVEN
2113-132484-0033 SO AS TO AVOID BORROWING FROM THAT MAN UNTIL HE OFFERED HELP DOUNIA SEEMED STRANGELY IMPRESSED BY SVIDRIGAILOV'S OFFER SHE STILL STOOD MEDITATING HE HAS GOT SOME TERRIBLE PLAN SHE SAID IN A HALF WHISPER TO HERSELF ALMOST SHUDDERING
2113-132484-0034 RASKOLNIKOV NOTICED THIS DISPROPORTIONATE TERROR I FANCY I SHALL HAVE TO SEE HIM MORE THAN ONCE AGAIN HE SAID TO DOUNIA WE WILL WATCH HIM I WILL TRACK HIM OUT CRIED RAZUMIHIN VIGOROUSLY I WON'T LOSE SIGHT OF HIM
2113-132484-0035 RODYA HAS GIVEN ME LEAVE HE SAID TO ME HIMSELF JUST NOW TAKE CARE OF MY SISTER WILL YOU GIVE ME LEAVE TOO AVDOTYA ROMANOVNA DOUNIA SMILED AND HELD OUT HER HAND BUT THE LOOK OF ANXIETY DID NOT LEAVE HER FACE
2113-132484-0036 PULCHERIA ALEXANDROVNA GAZED AT HER TIMIDLY BUT THE THREE THOUSAND ROUBLES HAD OBVIOUSLY A SOOTHING EFFECT ON HER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER THEY WERE ALL ENGAGED IN A LIVELY CONVERSATION EVEN RASKOLNIKOV LISTENED ATTENTIVELY FOR SOME TIME THOUGH HE DID NOT TALK
2113-132484-0037 RAZUMIHIN WAS THE SPEAKER AND WHY WHY SHOULD YOU GO AWAY HE FLOWED ON ECSTATICALLY AND WHAT ARE YOU TO DO IN A LITTLE TOWN THE GREAT THING IS YOU ARE ALL HERE TOGETHER AND YOU NEED ONE ANOTHER
2113-132484-0038 FOR A TIME ANYWAY TAKE ME INTO PARTNERSHIP AND I ASSURE YOU WE'LL PLAN A CAPITAL ENTERPRISE LISTEN I'LL EXPLAIN IT ALL IN DETAIL TO YOU THE WHOLE PROJECT IT ALL FLASHED INTO MY HEAD THIS MORNING BEFORE ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED I TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE AN UNCLE I MUST INTRODUCE HIM TO YOU A
2113-132484-0039 MOST ACCOMMODATING AND RESPECTABLE OLD MAN
2113-132484-0040 FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS HE HAS BEEN BOTHERING ME TO BORROW IT FROM HIM AND PAY HIM SIX PER CENT INTEREST I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS HE SIMPLY WANTS TO HELP ME LAST YEAR I HAD NO NEED OF IT BUT THIS YEAR I RESOLVED TO BORROW IT AS SOON AS HE ARRIVED
2113-132484-0041 THEN YOU LEND ME ANOTHER THOUSAND OF YOUR THREE AND WE HAVE ENOUGH FOR A START SO WE'LL GO INTO PARTNERSHIP AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO THEN RAZUMIHIN BEGAN TO UNFOLD HIS PROJECT
2113-132484-0042 KNOW NOTHING AT ALL OF WHAT THEY ARE SELLING AND FOR THAT REASON THEY ARE USUALLY BAD PUBLISHERS AND THAT ANY DECENT PUBLICATIONS PAY AS A RULE AND GIVE A PROFIT SOMETIMES A CONSIDERABLE ONE RAZUMIHIN HAD INDEED BEEN DREAMING OF SETTING UP AS A PUBLISHER
2113-132484-0043 FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS HE HAD BEEN WORKING IN PUBLISHERS OFFICES AND KNEW THREE EUROPEAN LANGUAGES WELL THOUGH HE HAD TOLD RASKOLNIKOV SIX DAYS BEFORE THAT HE WAS SCHWACH IN GERMAN WITH AN OBJECT OF PERSUADING HIM TO TAKE HALF HIS TRANSLATION AND HALF THE PAYMENT FOR IT
2113-132484-0044 HE HAD TOLD A LIE THEN AND RASKOLNIKOV KNEW HE WAS LYING WHY
2113-132484-0045 OF COURSE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF WORK BUT WE WILL WORK YOU AVDOTYA ROMANOVNA I RODION
2113-132484-0046 I CAN BE OF USE BECAUSE I HAVE EXPERIENCE FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS I'VE BEEN SCUTTLING ABOUT AMONG THE PUBLISHERS AND NOW I KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF THEIR BUSINESS YOU NEED NOT BE A SAINT TO MAKE POTS BELIEVE ME
2113-132484-0047 WHY I KNOW AND I KEPT THE SECRET TWO OR THREE BOOKS WHICH ONE MIGHT GET A HUNDRED ROUBLES SIMPLY FOR THINKING OF TRANSLATING AND PUBLISHING INDEED AND I WOULD NOT TAKE FIVE HUNDRED FOR THE VERY IDEA OF ONE OF THEM
2113-132484-0048 IF I WERE TO TELL A PUBLISHER I DARE SAY HE'D HESITATE THEY ARE SUCH BLOCKHEADS AND AS FOR THE BUSINESS SIDE PRINTING PAPER SELLING YOU TRUST TO ME I KNOW MY WAY ABOUT WE'LL BEGIN IN A SMALL WAY AND GO ON TO A LARGE

2113-132484-0066 RASKOLNIKOV STOPPED ONCE MORE ONCE FOR ALL NEVER ASK ME ABOUT ANYTHING I HAVE NOTHING TO TELL YOU DON'T COME TO SEE ME MAYBE I'LL COME HERE LEAVE ME BUT DON'T LEAVE THEM
2113-132484-0067 IT WAS DARK IN THE CORRIDOR THEY WERE STANDING NEAR THE LAMP FOR A MINUTE THEY WERE LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER IN SILENCE RAZUMIHIN REMEMBERED THAT MINUTE ALL HIS LIFE RASKOLNIKOV'S BURNING AND INTENT EYES GREW MORE PENETRATING EVERY MOMENT
2113-132484-0068 PIERCING INTO HIS SOUL INTO HIS CONSCIOUSNESS SUDDENLY RAZUMIHIN STARTED SOMETHING STRANGE AS IT WERE PASSED BETWEEN THEM SOME IDEA SOME HINT AS IT WERE SLIPPED SOMETHING AWFUL HIDEOUS AND SUDDENLY UNDERSTOOD ON BOTH SIDES RAZUMIHIN TURNED PALE
2113-132484-0069 DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW SAID RASKOLNIKOV HIS FACE TWITCHING NERVOUSLY GO BACK GO TO THEM HE SAID SUDDENLY AND TURNING QUICKLY HE WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE HOW RAZUMIHIN WENT BACK TO THE LADIES HOW HE SOOTHED THEM
2113-132484-0070 HOW HE PROTESTED THAT RODYA NEEDED REST IN HIS ILLNESS PROTESTED THAT RODYA WAS SURE TO COME THAT HE WOULD COME EVERY DAY THAT HE WAS VERY VERY MUCH UPSET THAT HE MUST NOT BE IRRITATED THAT HE RAZUMIHIN WOULD WATCH OVER HIM WOULD GET HIM A DOCTOR THE BEST DOCTOR A CONSULTATION
2113-132485-0000 RASKOLNIKOV WENT STRAIGHT TO THE HOUSE ON THE CANAL BANK WHERE SONIA LIVED IT WAS AN OLD GREEN HOUSE OF THREE STOREYS HE FOUND THE PORTER AND OBTAINED FROM HIM VAGUE DIRECTIONS AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF KAPERNAUMOV THE TAILOR
2113-132485-0001 HAVING FOUND IN THE CORNER OF THE COURTYARD THE ENTRANCE TO THE DARK AND NARROW STAIRCASE HE MOUNTED TO THE SECOND FLOOR AND CAME OUT INTO A GALLERY THAT RAN ROUND THE WHOLE SECOND STOREY OVER THE YARD WHILE HE WAS WANDERING IN THE DARKNESS UNCERTAIN WHERE TO TURN FOR KAPERNAUMOV'S DOOR
2113-132485-0002 A DOOR OPENED THREE PACES FROM HIM HE MECHANICALLY TOOK HOLD OF IT WHO IS THERE A WOMAN'S VOICE ASKED UNEASILY IT'S I COME TO SEE YOU ANSWERED RASKOLNIKOV AND HE WALKED INTO THE TINY ENTRY
2113-132485-0003 ON A BROKEN CHAIR STOOD A CANDLE IN A BATTERED COPPER CANDLESTICK IT'S YOU GOOD HEAVENS CRIED SONIA WEAKLY AND SHE STOOD ROOTED TO THE SPOT WHICH IS YOUR ROOM THIS WAY AND RASKOLNIKOV TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT HER HASTENED IN
2113-132485-0004 A MINUTE LATER SONIA TOO CAME IN WITH THE CANDLE SET DOWN THE CANDLESTICK AND COMPLETELY DISCONCERTED STOOD BEFORE HIM INEXPRESSIBLY AGITATED AND APPARENTLY FRIGHTENED BY HIS UNEXPECTED VISIT
2113-132485-0005 SHE FELT SICK AND ASHAMED AND HAPPY TOO RASKOLNIKOV TURNED AWAY QUICKLY AND SAT ON A CHAIR BY THE TABLE HE SCANNED THE ROOM IN A RAPID GLANCE IT WAS A LARGE BUT EXCEEDINGLY LOW PITCHED ROOM THE ONLY ONE LET BY THE KAPERNAUMOVS
2113-132485-0006 TO WHOSE ROOMS A CLOSED DOOR LED IN THE WALL ON THE LEFT IN THE OPPOSITE SIDE ON THE RIGHT HAND WALL WAS ANOTHER DOOR ALWAYS KEPT LOCKED THAT LED TO THE NEXT FLAT WHICH FORMED A SEPARATE LODGING SONIA'S ROOM LOOKED LIKE A BARN
2113-132485-0007 IT WAS A VERY IRREGULAR QUADRANGLE AND THIS GAVE IT A GROTESQUE APPEARANCE A WALL WITH THREE WINDOWS LOOKING OUT ON TO THE CANAL RAN ASLANT SO THAT ONE CORNER FORMED A VERY ACUTE ANGLE AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE IN IT WITHOUT VERY STRONG LIGHT
2113-132485-0008 THE OTHER CORNER WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY OBTUSE THERE WAS SCARCELY ANY FURNITURE IN THE BIG ROOM IN THE CORNER ON THE RIGHT WAS A BEDSTEAD BESIDE IT NEAREST THE DOOR A CHAIR A PLAIN DEAL TABLE COVERED BY A BLUE CLOTH STOOD AGAINST THE SAME WALL
2113-132485-0009 CLOSE TO THE DOOR INTO THE OTHER FLAT TWO RUSH BOTTOM CHAIRS STOOD BY THE TABLE ON THE OPPOSITE WALL NEAR THE ACUTE ANGLE STOOD A SMALL PLAIN WOODEN CHEST OF DRAWERS LOOKING AS IT WERE LOST IN A DESERT THAT WAS ALL THERE WAS IN THE ROOM
2113-132485-0010 THE YELLOW SCRATCHED AND SHABBY WALL PAPER WAS BLACK IN THE CORNERS IT MUST HAVE BEEN DAMP AND FULL OF FUMES IN THE WINTER THERE WAS EVERY SIGN OF POVERTY EVEN THE BEDSTEAD HAD NO CURTAIN
2113-132485-0011 SONIA LOOKED IN SILENCE AT HER VISITOR WHO WAS SO ATTENTIVELY AND UNCEREMONIOUSLY SCRUTINISING HER ROOM AND EVEN BEGAN AT LAST TO TREMBLE WITH TERROR AS THOUGH SHE WAS STANDING BEFORE HER JUDGE AND THE ARBITER OF HER DESTINIES
2113-132485-0012 HE ASKED STILL NOT LIFTING HIS EYES YES MUTTERED SONIA OH YES IT IS SHE ADDED HASTILY AS THOUGH IN THAT LAY HER MEANS OF ESCAPE MY LANDLADY'S CLOCK HAS JUST STRUCK I HEARD IT MYSELF
2113-132485-0014 THEN YOU ARE NOT COMING TO KATERINA IVANOVNA TO MORROW SONIA'S VOICE SHOOK I DON'T KNOW I SHALL KNOW TO MORROW MORNING NEVER MIND THAT I'VE COME TO SAY ONE WORD
2113-132485-0015 HE RAISED HIS BROODING EYES TO HER AND SUDDENLY NOTICED THAT HE WAS SITTING DOWN WHILE SHE WAS ALL THE WHILE STANDING BEFORE HIM WHY ARE YOU STANDING SIT DOWN HE SAID IN A CHANGED VOICE GENTLE AND FRIENDLY SHE SAT DOWN HE LOOKED KINDLY AND ALMOST COMPASSIONATELY AT HER
2113-132485-0016 HOW THIN YOU ARE WHAT A HAND QUITE TRANSPARENT LIKE A DEAD HAND HE TOOK HER HAND SONIA SMILED FAINTLY I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT SHE SAID EVEN WHEN YOU LIVED AT HOME YES
2113-132485-0017 OF COURSE YOU WERE HE ADDED ABRUPTLY AND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE AND THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE CHANGED AGAIN SUDDENLY HE LOOKED ROUND HIM ONCE MORE YOU RENT THIS ROOM FROM THE KAPERNAUMOVS YES THEY LIVE THERE THROUGH THAT DOOR
2113-132485-0018 YES THEY HAVE ANOTHER ROOM LIKE THIS ALL IN ONE ROOM YES I SHOULD BE AFRAID IN YOUR ROOM AT NIGHT HE OBSERVED GLOOMILY THEY ARE VERY GOOD PEOPLE VERY KIND ANSWERED SONIA WHO STILL SEEMED BEWILDERED
2113-132485-0019 AND ALL THE FURNITURE EVERYTHING EVERYTHING IS THEIRS AND THEY ARE VERY KIND AND THE CHILDREN TOO OFTEN COME TO SEE ME THEY ALL STAMMER DON'T THEY YES HE STAMMERS AND HE'S LAME AND HIS WIFE TOO
2113-132485-0020 IT'S NOT EXACTLY THAT SHE STAMMERS BUT SHE CAN'T SPEAK PLAINLY SHE IS A VERY KIND WOMAN AND HE USED TO BE A HOUSE SERF AND THERE ARE SEVEN CHILDREN AND IT'S ONLY THE ELDEST ONE THAT STAMMERS AND THE OTHERS ARE SIMPLY ILL BUT THEY DON'T STAMMER
2113-132485-0021 BUT WHERE DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM SHE ADDED WITH SOME SURPRISE YOUR FATHER TOLD ME THEN HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU AND HOW YOU WENT OUT AT SIX O'CLOCK AND CAME BACK AT NINE AND HOW KATERINA IVANOVNA KNELT DOWN BY YOUR BED
2113-132485-0022 SONIA WAS CONFUSED I FANCIED I SAW HIM TO DAY SHE WHISPERED HESITATINGLY WHOM FATHER I WAS WALKING IN THE STREET OUT THERE AT THE CORNER ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AND HE SEEMED TO BE WALKING IN FRONT IT LOOKED JUST LIKE HIM
2113-132485-0023 I WANTED TO GO TO KATERINA IVANOVNA YOU WERE WALKING IN THE STREETS YES SONIA WHISPERED ABRUPTLY AGAIN OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION AND LOOKING DOWN
2113-132485-0024 OH NO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING NO SONIA LOOKED AT HIM ALMOST WITH DISMAY YOU LOVE HER THEN LOVE HER OF COURSE SAID SONIA WITH PLAINTIVE EMPHASIS AND SHE CLASPED HER HANDS IN DISTRESS
2113-132485-0025 YOU SEE SHE IS QUITE LIKE A CHILD HER MIND IS QUITE UNHINGED YOU SEE FROM SORROW AND HOW CLEVER SHE USED TO BE HOW GENEROUS HOW KIND
2113-132485-0026 HER PALE CHEEKS FLUSHED THERE WAS A LOOK OF ANGUISH IN HER EYES IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE WAS STIRRED TO THE VERY DEPTHS THAT SHE WAS LONGING TO SPEAK TO CHAMPION TO EXPRESS SOMETHING A SORT OF INSATIABLE COMPASSION IF ONE MAY SO EXPRESS IT WAS REFLECTED IN EVERY FEATURE OF HER FACE
2113-132485-0027 BEAT ME HOW CAN YOU GOOD HEAVENS BEAT ME AND IF SHE DID BEAT ME WHAT THEN WHAT OF IT YOU KNOW NOTHING NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE IS SO UNHAPPY AH HOW UNHAPPY AND ILL SHE IS SEEKING RIGHTEOUSNESS SHE IS PURE
2113-132485-0028 SHE HAS SUCH FAITH THAT THERE MUST BE RIGHTEOUSNESS EVERYWHERE AND SHE EXPECTS IT AND IF YOU WERE TO TORTURE HER SHE WOULDN'T DO WRONG SHE DOESN'T SEE THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO BE RIGHTEOUS AND SHE IS ANGRY AT IT LIKE A CHILD LIKE A CHILD SHE IS GOOD
2113-132485-0029 AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU SONIA LOOKED AT HIM INQUIRINGLY THEY ARE LEFT ON YOUR HANDS YOU SEE THEY WERE ALL ON YOUR HANDS BEFORE THOUGH AND YOUR FATHER CAME TO YOU TO BEG FOR DRINK WELL HOW WILL IT BE NOW
2113-132485-0030 I DON'T KNOW SONIA ARTICULATED MOURNFULLY WILL THEY STAY THERE I DON'T KNOW THEY ARE IN DEBT FOR THE LODGING BUT THE LANDLADY I HEAR SAID TO DAY THAT SHE WANTED TO GET RID OF THEM AND KATERINA IVANOVNA SAYS THAT SHE WON'T STAY ANOTHER MINUTE
2113-132485-0031 OH NO DON'T TALK LIKE THAT WE ARE ONE WE LIVE LIKE ONE
2113-132485-0032 SHE PERSISTED GETTING HOT AND EXCITED AND HOW SHE CRIED TO DAY HER MIND IS UNHINGED HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED IT AT ONE MINUTE SHE IS WORRYING LIKE A CHILD THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE RIGHT TO MORROW THE LUNCH AND ALL THAT
2113-132485-0033 THEN SHE IS WRINGING HER HANDS SPITTING BLOOD WEEPING AND ALL AT ONCE SHE WILL BEGIN KNOCKING HER HEAD AGAINST THE WALL IN DESPAIR THEN SHE WILL BE COMFORTED AGAIN
2113-132485-0034 SHE BUILDS ALL HER HOPES ON YOU SHE SAYS THAT YOU WILL HELP HER NOW AND THAT SHE WILL BORROW A LITTLE MONEY SOMEWHERE AND GO TO HER NATIVE TOWN WITH ME AND SET UP A BOARDING SCHOOL FOR THE DAUGHTERS OF GENTLEMEN AND TAKE ME TO SUPERINTEND IT
2113-132485-0035 AND SHE KISSES AND HUGS ME COMFORTS ME AND YOU KNOW SHE HAS SUCH FAITH SUCH FAITH IN HER FANCIES ONE CAN'T CONTRADICT HER AND ALL THE DAY LONG SHE HAS BEEN WASHING CLEANING MENDING
2113-132485-0036 GASPING FOR BREATH WE WENT THIS MORNING TO THE SHOPS TO BUY SHOES FOR POLENKA AND LIDA FOR THEIRS ARE QUITE WORN OUT ONLY THE MONEY WE'D RECKONED WASN'T ENOUGH NOT NEARLY ENOUGH AND SHE PICKED OUT SUCH DEAR LITTLE BOOTS FOR SHE HAS TASTE YOU DON'T KNOW
2113-132485-0037 AND THERE IN THE SHOP SHE BURST OUT CRYING BEFORE THE SHOPMEN BECAUSE SHE HADN'T ENOUGH AH IT WAS SAD TO SEE HER WELL AFTER THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR LIVING LIKE THIS RASKOLNIKOV SAID WITH A BITTER SMILE AND AREN'T YOU SORRY FOR THEM AREN'T YOU SORRY
2113-132485-0038 SONIA FLEW AT HIM AGAIN WHY I KNOW YOU GAVE YOUR LAST PENNY YOURSELF THOUGH YOU'D SEEN NOTHING OF IT AND IF YOU'D SEEN EVERYTHING OH DEAR AND HOW OFTEN HOW OFTEN I'VE BROUGHT HER TO TEARS ONLY LAST WEEK YES I
2113-132485-0039 ONLY A WEEK BEFORE HIS DEATH I WAS CRUEL AND HOW OFTEN I'VE DONE IT AH I'VE BEEN WRETCHED AT THE THOUGHT OF IT ALL DAY SONIA WRUNG HER HANDS AS SHE SPOKE AT THE PAIN OF REMEMBERING IT YOU WERE CRUEL YES I I I
2113-132485-0040 WENT TO SEE THEM SHE WENT ON WEEPING AND FATHER SAID READ ME SOMETHING SONIA MY HEAD ACHES READ TO ME HERE'S A BOOK
2113-132485-0041 AND I SAID I CAN'T STAY AS I DIDN'T WANT TO READ AND I'D GONE IN CHIEFLY TO SHOW KATERINA IVANOVNA SOME COLLARS LIZAVETA THE PEDLAR SOLD ME SOME COLLARS AND CUFFS CHEAP PRETTY NEW EMBROIDERED ONES
2113-132485-0042 KATERINA IVANOVNA LIKED THEM VERY MUCH SHE PUT THEM ON AND LOOKED AT HERSELF IN THE GLASS AND WAS DELIGHTED WITH THEM MAKE ME A PRESENT OF THEM SONIA SHE SAID PLEASE DO PLEASE DO SHE SAID SHE WANTED THEM SO MUCH AND WHEN COULD SHE WEAR THEM
2113-132485-0043 THEY JUST REMINDED HER OF HER OLD HAPPY DAYS SHE LOOKED AT HERSELF IN THE GLASS ADMIRED HERSELF AND SHE HAS NO CLOTHES AT ALL NO THINGS OF HER OWN HASN'T HAD ALL THESE YEARS AND SHE NEVER ASKS ANYONE FOR ANYTHING SHE IS PROUD SHE'D SOONER GIVE AWAY EVERYTHING
2113-132485-0044 AND THESE SHE ASKED FOR SHE LIKED THEM SO MUCH AND I WAS SORRY TO GIVE THEM WHAT USE ARE THEY TO YOU KATERINA IVANOVNA I SAID I SPOKE LIKE THAT TO HER
2113-132485-0045 SHE GAVE ME SUCH A LOOK AND SHE WAS SO GRIEVED SO GRIEVED AT MY REFUSING HER AND IT WAS SO SAD TO SEE AND SHE WAS NOT GRIEVED FOR THE COLLARS BUT FOR MY REFUSING I SAW THAT
2113-132485-0046 AH IF ONLY I COULD BRING IT ALL BACK CHANGE IT TAKE BACK THOSE WORDS AH IF I BUT IT'S NOTHING TO YOU DID YOU KNOW LIZAVETA THE PEDLAR YES DID YOU KNOW HER SONIA ASKED WITH SOME SURPRISE
2113-132485-0047 KATERINA IVANOVNA IS IN CONSUMPTION RAPID CONSUMPTION SHE WILL SOON DIE SAID RASKOLNIKOV AFTER A PAUSE WITHOUT ANSWERING HER QUESTION OH NO NO NO
2113-132485-0048 AND SONIA UNCONSCIOUSLY CLUTCHED BOTH HIS HANDS AS THOUGH IMPLORING THAT SHE SHOULD NOT
2388-153728-0000 FROM A HISTORICAL AND PICTURESQUE POINT OF VIEW
2388-153728-0001 IS THEIR EFFECT UPON THE FORMS OF THE CONSTELLATIONS
2388-153728-0002 THE CONSTELLATIONS ARE FORMED BY CHANCE COMBINATIONS OF CONSPICUOUS STARS LIKE FIGURES IN A KALEIDOSCOPE
2388-153728-0003 OF COSMIC EXISTENCE WE SHOULD PERCEIVE THAT THE KALEIDOSCOPE OF THE HEAVENS WAS CEASELESSLY TURNING AND THROWING THE STARS
2388-153728-0004 EVEN IF THE STARS STOOD FAST THE MOTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM WOULD GRADUALLY ALTER THE CONFIGURATIONS AS THE ELEMENTS OF A LANDSCAPE DISSOLVE AND RECOMBINE IN FRESH GROUPINGS WITH THE TRAVELER'S PROGRESS AMID THEM BUT WITH THE STARS THEMSELVES
2388-153728-0005 ONLY THE DELIBERATION OF GEOLOGICAL MOVEMENTS CAN BE CONTRASTED WITH THE EVOLUTION AND DEVOLUTION OF THE CONSTELLATIONS AND YET THIS SECULAR FLUCTUATION OF THE CONSTELLATION FIGURES IS NOT WITHOUT KEEN INTEREST FOR THE MEDITATIVE OBSERVER
2388-153728-0007 IN THE FORMS OF THE CONSTELLATIONS
2388-153728-0008 YET IN A BROAD SENSE THIS SCROLL OF HUMAN THOUGHT IMPRINTED ON THE HEAVENS
2388-153728-0009 ALTHOUGH MORE ENDURING THAN PARCHMENT TOMBS PYRAMIDS AND TEMPLES
2388-153728-0010 OF WHAT MAN HAS FANCIED AND DONE BEFORE STUDYING THE EFFECTS THAT THE MOTIONS OF THE STARS HAVE HAD AND WILL HAVE UPON THE CONSTELLATIONS
2388-153728-0011 TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE EFFECTS IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO RECALL THAT THE CONSTELLATIONS REGISTER THE OLDEST TRADITIONS OF OUR RACE IN THE HISTORY OF PRIMEVAL RELIGIONS
2388-153728-0012 BASED ON SOMETHING OLDER YET WE MAY REFER FOR ILLUSTRATION TO THAT OF THE MYSTERIOUS MAYA RACE OF AMERICA AT IZAMAL IN YUCATAN SAYS MISTER STANSBURY HAGAR IS A GROUP OF RUINS PERCHED AFTER THE MEXICAN AND CENTRAL AMERICAN PLAN
2388-153728-0013 THE FIGURES AND THE NAMES OF COURSE WERE NOT THE SAME AS THOSE THAT WE HAVE DERIVED FROM OUR ARYAN ANCESTORS BUT THE STAR GROUPS WERE THE SAME OR NEARLY SO FOR INSTANCE THE LOFTIEST OF THE TEMPLES AT IZAMAL
2388-153728-0014 WAS CONNECTED WITH THE SIGN OF THE CONSTELLATION KNOWN TO US AS CANCER
2388-153728-0015 AND CONSUME THE OFFERINGS LEFT UPON THE ALTAR OUR SCORPIO WAS KNOWN TO THE MAYAS AS A SIGN OF THE DEATH GOD OUR LIBRA THE BALANCE
2388-153728-0016 SEEMS TO BE IDENTICAL WITH THE MAYAN CONSTELLATION
2388-153728-0017 WITH WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED A TEMPLE WHERE DWELT THE PRIESTS WHOSE SPECIAL BUSINESS IT WAS TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE AND TO FORETELL THE FUTURE BY MEANS OF INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD ORION THE HUNTER OF OUR CELESTIAL MYTHOLOGY
2388-153728-0018 WAS AMONG THE MAYAS A WARRIOR WHILE SAGITTARIUS AND OTHERS OF OUR CONSTELLATIONS WERE KNOWN TO THEM UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES OF COURSE AND ALL WERE ENDOWED WITH A RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM AND THE SAME STAR FIGURES HAVING THE SAME SIGNIFICANCE WERE FAMILIAR TO THE PERUVIANS
2388-153728-0019 BUT IN FACT
2388-153728-0020 EMPLOYED THEM IN SOME SYMBOLIC OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY AS HANDLED BY THE GREEKS FROM PREHISTORIC TIMES THE CONSTELLATION MYTHS BECAME THE VERY SOUL OF POETRY THE IMAGINATION OF THAT WONDERFUL RACE IDEALIZED THE PRINCIPAL STAR GROUPS
2388-153728-0021 SO EFFECTIVELY THAT THE FIGURES AND TRADITIONS THUS ATTACHED TO THEM HAVE FOR CIVILIZED MANKIND DISPLACED ALL OTHERS JUST AS GREEK ART IN ITS HIGHEST FORMS STANDS WITHOUT PARALLEL AND ECLIPSES EVERY RIVAL
2388-153728-0022 THE ROMANS TRANSLATED NO HEROES AND HEROINES OF THE MYTHICAL PERIOD OF THEIR HISTORY TO THE SKY
2388-153728-0023 ZEUS IN THE FORM OF THE WHITE BULL TAURUS BEARS THE FAIR EUROPA ON HIS BACK THROUGH THE CELESTIAL WAVES ANDROMEDA STRETCHES FORTH HER SHACKLED ARMS IN THE STAR GEMMED ETHER BESEECHING AID
2388-153728-0024 PROFESSOR YOUNG HAS SIGNIFICANTLY REMARKED THAT A GREAT NUMBER OF THE CONSTELLATIONS ARE CONNECTED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER
2388-153728-0025 THAT STRANGELY FASCINATING LEGEND OF EARLIEST GREEK STORY WHICH HAS NEVER LOST ITS CHARM FOR MANKIND IN VIEW OF ALL THIS WE MAY WELL CONGRATULATE OURSELVES THAT THE CONSTELLATIONS WILL OUTLAST OUR TIME AND THE TIME OF COUNTLESS GENERATIONS TO FOLLOW US
2388-153728-0026 AND YET THEY ARE VERY FAR FROM BEING ETERNAL LET US NOW STUDY SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF THE STELLAR MOTIONS UPON THEM WE BEGIN WITH THE FAMILIAR FIGURE OF THE GREAT DIPPER HE WHO HAS NOT DRUNK INSPIRATION FROM ITS CELESTIAL BOWL
2388-153728-0027 THIS FIGURE IS MADE UP OF SEVEN CONSPICUOUS STARS IN THE CONSTELLATION URSA MAJOR THE GREATER BEAR THE HANDLE OF THE DIPPER
2388-153728-0028 OF THE SEVEN STARS MENTIONED SIX ARE OF NEARLY EQUAL BRIGHTNESS RANKING AS OF THE SECOND MAGNITUDE WHILE THE SEVENTH IS OF ONLY THE THIRD MAGNITUDE
2388-153728-0029 THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE FAINT STAR WHICH IS SITUATED AT THE JUNCTION OF THE BOWL AND THE HANDLE IS A VARIABLE OF LONG PERIOD SINCE THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
2388-153728-0030 BOTH THE NAMES AND THE GREEK LETTERS WHICH ARE ATTACHED TO THE SEVEN STARS BEGINNING AT THE STAR IN THE UPPER OUTER EDGE OF THE RIM OF THE BOWL AND RUNNING IN REGULAR ORDER ROUND THE BOTTOM AND THEN OUT TO THE END OF THE HANDLE
2388-153728-0031 IS THE FAINT STAR ALREADY MENTIONED AT THE JUNCTION OF THE BOWL AND HANDLE AND MIZAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HANDLE HAS A CLOSE NAKED EYE COMPANION WHICH IS NAMED ALCOR
2388-153728-0032 ARE CALLED THE POINTERS BECAUSE AN IMAGINARY LINE DRAWN NORTHWARD THROUGH THEM INDICATES THE POLE STAR
2388-153728-0033 WITH ITS COMRADE ARE MOVING WITH PRACTICALLY THE SAME SPEED IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION WHILE THE OTHER TWO
2388-153728-0034 BENETNASCH ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY MOVING WESTWARD THE MOTIONS OF BENETNASCH BEING APPARENTLY MORE RAPID THE CONSEQUENCE OF THESE OPPOSED MOTIONS IS OF COURSE THAT THE FIGURE OF THE DIPPER CANNOT ALWAYS HAVE EXISTED
2388-153728-0035 AND WILL NOT CONTINUE TO EXIST IN THE ACCOMPANYING DIAGRAMS IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT INTERESTING TO SHOW THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THESE SEVEN STARS AS SEEN FROM THE POINT WHICH THE EARTH NOW OCCUPIES BOTH IN THE PAST AND IN THE FUTURE
2388-153728-0036 THE TIME NO DOUBT SEEMS LONG BUT REMEMBER THE VAST STRETCH OF AGES THROUGH WHICH THE EARTH HAS PASSED AND THEN REFLECT THAT NO REASON IS APPARENT WHY OUR GLOBE SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO BE A SCENE OF ANIMATION FOR TEN THOUSAND CENTURIES YET TO COME
2388-153728-0037 THE FACT THAT THE LITTLE STAR ALCOR PLACED SO CLOSE TO MIZAR SHOULD ACCOMPANY THE LATTER IN ITS FLIGHT IS NOT SURPRISING
2388-153728-0038 IS SURPRISING IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE AND IT RECALLS THE STRANGE THEORY OF A DOUBLE DRIFT AFFECTING ALL THE STARS TO WHICH ATTENTION WAS CALLED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER
2388-153728-0039 FROM THE GREAT DIPPER WE TURN TO A CONSTELLATION HARDLY LESS CONSPICUOUS AND SITUATED AT AN EQUAL DISTANCE FROM THE POLE ON THE OTHER SIDE CASSIOPEIA
2388-153728-0040 WAS PUNISHED BY THE EXPOSURE OF HER DAUGHTER ANDROMEDA TO THE SEA MONSTER IS WELL MARKED BY FIVE STARS WHICH FORM AN IRREGULAR LETTER W WITH ITS OPEN SIDE TOWARD THE POLE
2388-153728-0041 FOUR OF THEM BETA ALPHA DELTA AND EPSILON ARE TRAVELING EASTWARDLY AT VARIOUS SPEEDS WHILE THE FIFTH GAMMA MOVES IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION
2388-153728-0042 AND DIFFERENT OBSERVERS OFTEN VARY CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR RESULTS IN THE BEAUTIFUL NORTHERN CROWN
2388-153728-0043 THE ALTERNATE COMBINING AND SCATTERING EFFECTS OF THE STELLAR MOTIONS ARE SHOWN BY COMPARING THE APPEARANCE
2388-153728-0044 WITH THAT WHICH IT HAS AT PRESENT AND THAT WHICH IT WILL HAVE IN THE FUTURE THE SEVEN PRINCIPLE STARS OF THE ASTERISM FORMING A SURPRISINGLY PERFECT CORONET HAVE MOVEMENTS IN THREE DIRECTIONS AT RIGHT ANGLES TO ONE ANOTHER
2388-153728-0045 JOB'S COFFIN DELPHINUS THE GREAT SQUARE OF PEGASUS THE TWINS GEMINI THE BEAUTIFUL SICKLE IN LEO AND THE EXQUISITE GROUP OF THE HYADES IN TAURUS
2388-153728-0046 ALDEBARAN ONE OF THE FINEST OF ALL STARS BOTH FOR ITS BRILLIANCE AND ITS COLOR IS THE MOST AFFECTED BY THE EASTERLY MOTION IN TIME IT WILL DRIFT ENTIRELY OUT OF CONNECTION WITH ITS PRESENT NEIGHBORS
2388-153728-0047 NOT BECAUSE ITS STARS ARE PHYSICALLY CONNECTED BUT BECAUSE OF THEIR GREAT DISTANCE WHICH RENDERS THEIR MOVEMENTS TOO DELIBERATE TO BE EXACTLY ASCERTAINED TWO OF THE GREATEST OF ITS STARS
2388-153728-0048 POSSESS AS FAR AS HAS BEEN ASCERTAINED NO PERCEPTIBLE MOTION ACROSS THE LINE OF SIGHT
2388-153728-0049 AT THE PRESENT TIME THIS CONSISTS OF AN ALMOST PERFECT STRAIGHT LINE A ROW OF SECOND MAGNITUDE STARS ABOUT EQUALLY SPACED
2388-153728-0050 IN THE COURSE OF TIME HOWEVER THE TWO RIGHT HAND STARS MINTAKA AND ALNILAM
2388-153728-0051 WILL APPROACH EACH OTHER AND FORM A NAKED EYE DOUBLE
2388-153728-0052 ALNITA WILL DRIFT AWAY EASTWARD SO THAT THE BELT WILL NO LONGER EXIST FOR ONE MORE EXAMPLE LET US GO TO THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE WHOSE MOST CELEBRATED CONSTELLATION THE SOUTHERN CROSS HAS FOUND A PLACE IN ALL MODERN LITERATURES
2388-153728-0053 ALTHOUGH IT HAS NO CLAIM TO CONSIDERATION ON ACCOUNT OF ASSOCIATION WITH ANCIENT LEGENDS THIS MOST ATTRACTIVE ASTERISM WHICH HAS NEVER CEASED TO FASCINATE THE IMAGINATION OF CHRISTENDOM SINCE IT WAS FIRST DEVOUTLY DESCRIBED BY THE EARLY EXPLORERS OF THE SOUTH
2388-153728-0054 IS BUT A PASSING COLLOCATION OF BRILLIANT STARS YET EVEN IN ITS TRANSFIGURATIONS IT HAS BEEN FOR HUNDREDS OF CENTURIES AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE FOR HUNDREDS OF CENTURIES TO COME A MOST STRIKING OBJECT IN THE SKY
2388-153728-0055 OUR FIGURES SHOW ITS APPEARANCE IN THREE SUCCESSIVE PHASES FIRST AS IT WAS FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO VIEWED FROM THE EARTH'S PRESENT LOCATION SECOND AS IT IS IN OUR DAY
2388-153728-0056 THE NEARNESS OF THESE BRIGHT STARS TO ONE ANOTHER THE LENGTH OF THE LONGER BEAM OF THE CROSS IS ONLY SIX DEGREES MAKES THIS GROUP VERY NOTICEABLE WHATEVER THE ARRANGEMENT OF ITS COMPONENTS MAY BE THE LARGEST STAR AT THE BASE OF THE CROSS
2388-153728-0057 BUT SINCE THE MOTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM ITSELF WILL IN THE COURSE OF SO LONG A PERIOD AS FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS PRODUCE A GREAT CHANGE IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE HEAVENS AS SEEN FROM THE EARTH BY CARRYING US NEARLY NINETEEN TRILLION MILES FROM OUR PRESENT PLACE
2388-153728-0058 WHY IT MAY BE ASKED SEEK TO REPRESENT FUTURE APPEARANCES OF THE CONSTELLATIONS WHICH WE COULD NOT HOPE TO SEE EVEN IF WE COULD SURVIVE SO LONG THE ANSWER IS
2388-153728-0059 THE CONSTELLATIONS ARE MORE OR LESS FAMILIAR TO EVERYBODY
2388-153728-0060 MUST AT ONCE STRIKE THE EYE AND THE IMAGINATION AND MAKE CLEARER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE STARS
2388-153728-0061 AND IF OUR RACE IS DESTINED TO SURVIVE YET A MILLION YEARS THEN OUR REMOTE DESCENDENTS WILL SEE A NEW HEAVENS
2388-153728-0062 IF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIVE DISTANCES OF THE STARS WERE MORE COMPLETE IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING EXERCISE IN CELESTIAL GEOMETRY TO PROJECT THE CONSTELLATIONS PROBABLY VISIBLE
2388-153728-0063 EXCEPT PERHAPS IN A FEW CASES AS SEEN FOR INSTANCE FROM THE NEAREST KNOWN STAR ALPHA CENTAURI
2388-153728-0064 COULD ONLY RANK AS A FIFTH OR SIXTH MAGNITUDE STAR
2388-153731-0000 AND NOTHING BUT DARK SKY IS VISIBLE AROUND IT EXCEPT FOR THE INTERFERENCE OF THE MOON WE SHOULD PROBABLY NEVER HAVE KNOWN THAT THERE IS ANY MORE OF THE SUN THAN OUR EYES ORDINARILY SEE BUT WHEN AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN OCCURS
2388-153731-0001 MAY BE CALLED THE SUN'S ATMOSPHERE THEY CONSIST OF TWO VERY DIFFERENT PARTS FIRST THE RED PROMINENCES WHICH RESEMBLE TONGUES OF FLAME ASCENDING THOUSANDS OF MILES ABOVE THE SUN'S SURFACE AND SECOND THE CORONA
2388-153731-0002 WHICH EXTENDS TO DISTANCES OF MILLIONS OF MILES FROM THE SUN AND SHINES WITH A SOFT GLOWING LIGHT THE TWO COMBINED WHEN WELL SEEN MAKE A SPECTACLE WITHOUT PARALLEL AMONG THE MARVELS OF THE SKY
2388-153731-0003 ALTHOUGH MANY ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO RENDER THE CORONA VISIBLE WHEN THERE IS NO ECLIPSE ALL HAVE FAILED AND IT IS TO THE MOON ALONE THAT WE OWE ITS REVELATION TO COVER THE SUN'S DISK WITH A CIRCULAR SCREEN
2388-153731-0004 AND THE CORONA APPEARS IN ALL ITS SURPRISING BEAUTY THE PROMINENCES HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THEY WERE DISCOVERED DURING AN ECLIPSE CAN NOW WITH THE AID OF THE SPECTROSCOPE BE SEEN AT ANY TIME BUT THE PROMINENCES ARE RARELY LARGE ENOUGH TO BE NOTICED BY THE NAKED EYE
2388-153731-0005 WHILE THE STREAMERS OF THE CORONA STRETCHING FAR AWAY IN SPACE LIKE GHOSTLY BANNERS BLOWN OUT FROM THE BLACK CIRCLE OF THE OBSCURING MOON ATTRACT EVERY EYE AND TO THIS WEIRD APPARITION MUCH OF THE FEAR INSPIRED BY ECLIPSES HAS BEEN DUE
2388-153731-0006 THE STORY OF THE FIRST SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATION OF THE CORONA AND THE PROMINENCES IS THRILLINGLY INTERESTING AND IN FACT DRAMATIC THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE DURING THE ECLIPSE OF EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO
2388-153731-0007 WHICH FORTUNATELY WAS VISIBLE ALL OVER CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN EUROPE SO THAT SCORES OF ASTRONOMERS SAW IT
2388-153731-0008 WHERE THE ENGLISH ASTRONOMER FRANCIS BAILY HAD SET UP HIS TELESCOPE THE ECLIPSE HAD BEGUN AND BAILEY WAS BUSY AT HIS TELESCOPE WHEN TO QUOTE HIS OWN WORDS IN THE ACCOUNT WHICH HE WROTE FOR THE MEMOIRS OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
2388-153731-0009 WALKING ABOUT THE STREETS AND SQUARES OR LOOKING OUT OF WINDOWS IN ORDER TO WITNESS THIS LONG TALKED OF PHENOMENON AND WHEN THE TOTAL OBSCURATION TOOK PLACE WHICH WAS INSTANTANEOUS THERE WAS A UNIVERSAL SHOUT FROM EVERY OBSERVER WHICH MADE THE WELKIN RING
2388-153731-0010 FROM ANY OF THE ACCOUNTS OF PRECEDING ECLIPSES THAT I HAD READ TO WITNESS SO MAGNIFICENT AN EXHIBITION AS THAT WHICH TOOK PLACE SPLENDID AND ASTONISHING HOWEVER AS THIS REMARKABLE PHENOMENON REALLY WAS
2388-153731-0011 THAT THERE WAS AT THE SAME TIME SOMETHING IN ITS SINGULAR AND WONDERFUL APPEARANCE THAT WAS APPALLING BUT THE MOST REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCE ATTENDING THE PHENOMENON
2388-153731-0012 APPARENTLY EMANATING FROM THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE MOON BUT EVIDENTLY FORMING A PORTION OF THE CORONA
2388-153731-0013 PERHAPS THE COLOR OF THE PEACH BLOSSOM WOULD MORE NEARLY REPRESENT IT
2388-153731-0014 WERE VISIBLE EVEN TO THE LAST MOMENT OF TOTAL OBSCURATION AND WHEN THE FIRST RAY OF LIGHT WAS ADMITTED FROM THE SUN THEY VANISHED WITH THE CORONA ALTOGETHER AND DAYLIGHT WAS INSTANTLY RESTORED I HAVE QUOTED NEARLY ALL OF THIS REMARKABLE DESCRIPTION
2388-153731-0015 NOT ALONE FOR ITS INTRINSIC INTEREST BUT BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST DEPICTION THAT CAN BE FOUND OF THE GENERAL PHENOMENA OF A TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE STILL NOT EVERY SUCH ECLIPSE OFFERS AN EQUALLY MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE
2388-153731-0016 YET ON BOTH OCCASIONS
2388-153731-0017 THE SOUTH CAROLINIANS GAVE A CHEER AND THE LADIES WAVED THEIR HANDKERCHIEFS WHEN THE CORONA INEFFABLY DELICATE OF FORM AND TEXTURE MELTED INTO SIGHT AND THEN IN TWO MINUTES MELTED AWAY AGAIN THE SPANIARDS
2388-153731-0018 CROWDED ON THE CITADEL HILL OF BURGOS WITH THEIR KING AND HIS ROYAL RETINUE IN THEIR MIDST
2388-153731-0019 THERE ARE RECOGNIZED TWO KINDS OF PROMINENCES THE ERRUPTIVE AND THE QUIESCENT
2388-153731-0020 APPEAR TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SUN SPOTS AND APPEAR ONLY ABOVE THE ZONES WHERE SPOTS ABOUND EITHER OF THEM WHEN SEEN IN PROJECTION AGAINST THE BRILLIANT SOLAR DISK APPEARS WHITE NOT RED AS AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF SKY
2388-153731-0021 THE QUIESCENT PROMINENCES WHOSE ELEVATION IS OFTEN FROM FORTY THOUSAND TO SIXTY THOUSAND MILES CONSIST AS THE SPECTROSCOPE SHOWS MAINLY OF HYDROGEN AND HELIUM THE LATTER IT WILL BE REMEMBERED
2388-153731-0022 IS AN ELEMENT WHICH WAS KNOWN TO BE IN THE SUN MANY YEARS BEFORE THE DISCOVERY THAT IT ALSO EXISTS IN SMALL QUANTITIES ON THE EARTH A FACT WHICH MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANCE WHICH WE CANNOT AT PRESENT SEE
2388-153731-0023 IS THAT THE EMANATION FROM RADIUM GRADUALLY AND SPONTANEOUSLY CHANGES INTO HELIUM AN ALCHEMISTICAL FEAT OF NATURE THAT HAS OPENED MANY CURIOUS VISTAS TO SPECULATIVE THINKERS THE ERUPTIVE PROMINENCES
2388-153731-0024 WHICH DO NOT SPREAD HORIZONTALLY LIKE THE OTHERS BUT ASCEND WITH MARVELOUS VELOCITY TO ELEVATIONS OF HALF A MILLION MILES OR MORE ARE APPARENTLY COMPOSED LARGELY OF METALLIC VAPORS I E METALS
2388-153731-0025 BUT WHICH AT SOLAR TEMPERATURES ARE KEPT IN A VOLATILIZED STATE THE VELOCITY OF THEIR ASCENT OCCASIONALLY AMOUNTS TO THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED MILES PER SECOND IT IS KNOWN FROM MATHEMATICAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT THE GRAVITATION OF THE SUN
2388-153731-0026 SO IT IS EVIDENT THAT SOME OF THE MATTER HURLED FORTH IN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCES MAY ESCAPE FROM SOLAR CONTROL AND GO SPEEDING OUT INTO SPACE COOLING AND CONDENSING INTO SOLID MASSES
2388-153731-0027 MIGHT NOT REACH THE PLANETS HERE THEN WE HAVE ON A RELATIVELY SMALL SCALE EXPLOSIONS
2388-153731-0028 BUT THEY EVIDENTLY HAVE AN INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH ERUPTIVE PROMINENCES
2388-153731-0029 EVIDENCES OF A CYCLONIC TENDENCY HAVE BEEN FOUND
2388-153731-0030 MIRA CETI A STAR WHICH EVERY ELEVEN MONTHS OR THEREABOUT FLAMES UP WITH GREAT BRILLIANCY
2388-153731-0031 THE ASSOCIATION OF THE CORONA WITH SUN SPOTS IS LESS EVIDENT THAN THAT OF THE ERUPTIVE PROMINENCES STILL SUCH AN ASSOCIATION EXISTS FOR THE FORM AND EXTENT OF THE CORONA VARY WITH THE SUN SPOT PERIOD OF WHICH WE SHALL PRESENTLY SPEAK
2388-153733-0000 COME OUTSIDE AND LOOK AT THE SKY
2388-153733-0001 WE WERE DUMBFOUNDED TO SEE THE HEAVENS FILLED WITH PALE FLAMES WHICH RAN LICKING AND QUIVERING OVER THE STARS INSTANTLY THERE SPRANG INTO MY TERRIFIED MIND THE RECOLLECTION OF AN AWFUL DESCRIPTION OF
2388-153733-0002 DREADFULLY IN EARNEST PREACHER OF THE OLD FASHIONED TYPE MY HEART LITERALLY SANK AT SIGHT OF THE SPECTACLE
2388-153733-0003 WHEN MENACING SPOTS OF CRIMSON APPEARED BREAKING OUT NOW HERE NOW THERE IN THE SHUDDERING SKY TOWARD THE NORTH THE SPECTACLE WAS APPALLING A HUGE ARCH SPANNED AN UNNATURALLY DARK SEGMENT RESTING ON THE HORIZON AND ABOVE THIS ARCH
2388-153733-0004 SPRANG UP BEAMS AND STREAMERS IN A STATE OF INCESSANT AGITATION SOMETIMES SHOOTING UP TO THE ZENITH WITH A VELOCITY THAT TOOK ONE'S BREATH AND SOMETIMES SUDDENLY FALLING INTO LONG RANKS AND MARCHING MARCHING MARCHING
2388-153733-0005 OR WERE SHAKEN TO AND FRO AS IF BY A MIGHTY NOISELESS WIND
2388-153733-0006 IS SELDOM SEEN WITH SO MUCH SPLENDOR I REMEMBER ANOTHER SIMILAR ONE SEEN FROM THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO ON THIS LAST OCCASION SOME OBSERVERS SAW A GREAT UPRIGHT BEAM OF LIGHT WHICH MAJESTICALLY MOVED ACROSS THE HEAVENS
2388-153733-0007 STALKING LIKE AN APPARITION IN THE MIDST
2388-153733-0008 OF WHOSE GENERAL MOVEMENTS IT SEEMED TO BE INDEPENDENT MAINTAINING ALWAYS ITS UPRIGHT POSTURE AND FOLLOWING A MAGNETIC PARALLEL FROM EAST TO WEST THIS MYSTERIOUS BEAM WAS SEEN BY NO LESS THAN TWENTY SIX OBSERVERS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
2388-153733-0009 INDICATING THAT THE APPARITION WAS ABOUT
2388-153733-0010 WHEN FOR MONTHS TOGETHER THE SUN DOES NOT RISE THE STRANGE CORUSCATIONS IN THE SKY OFTEN AFFORD A KIND OF SPECTRAL DAYLIGHT IN UNISON WITH THE WEIRD SCENERY OF THE WORLD OF ICE THE PAGES IN THE NARRATIVES OF ARCTIC EXPLORATION
2388-153733-0011 THAT ARE DEVOTED TO DESCRIPTIONS OF THE WONDERFUL EFFECTS OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS ARE SECOND TO NONE THAT MAN HAS EVER PENNED IN THEIR FASCINATION THE LIGHTS AS I HAVE ALREADY INTIMATED DISPLAY ASTONISHING COLORS PARTICULARLY SHADES OF RED AND GREEN
2388-153733-0012 THE DISCOVERY THAT THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE IS AFFECTED BY THE AURORA QUIVERING AND DARTING ABOUT IN A STATE OF EXTRAORDINARY EXCITEMENT WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE PLAYING IN THE SKY ONLY ADDED TO THE MYSTERY OF THE PHENOMENON UNTIL ITS ELECTRO MAGNETIC NATURE HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED
2388-153733-0013 THIS BECAME EVIDENT AS SOON AS IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE FOCUS OF THE DISPLAYS WAS THE MAGNETIC POLE AND WHEN THE FAR SOUTH WAS VISITED THE AURORA AUSTRALIS WAS FOUND HAVING ITS CENTER AT THE SOUTH MAGNETIC POLE THEN
2388-153733-0014 IF NOT BEFORE IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE EARTH WAS A GREAT GLOBULAR MAGNET HAVING ITS POLES OF OPPOSITE MAGNETISM AND THAT THE AURORAL LIGHTS WHATEVER THEIR PRECISE CAUSE MIGHT BE WERE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE MAGNETIC ACTIVITY OF OUR PLANET
2388-153733-0015 AND THE OCEAN CABLES CEASED TO WORK
2388-153733-0016 THE ANCIENT ZURICH CHRONICLES EXTENDING FROM THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND TO THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED IN WHICH BOTH SUN SPOTS VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE
2388-153733-0017 TWO INTENSELY BRILLIANT POINTS SUDDENLY BROKE OUT IN A GROUP OF SUN SPOTS WHICH WERE UNDER OBSERVATION BY MISTER R C CARRINGTON AT HIS OBSERVATORY AT REDHILL ENGLAND THE POINTS REMAINED VISIBLE FOR NOT MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES DURING WHICH INTERVAL
2388-153733-0018 THEY MOVED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES ACROSS THE SOLAR DISK MISTER R HODGSON HAPPENED TO SEE THE SAME PHENOMENON AT HIS OBSERVATORY AT HIGHGATE AND THUS ALL POSSIBILITY OF DECEPTION WAS REMOVED
2388-153733-0019 HISTORY OF ASTRONOMY DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
2388-153733-0020 TELEGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION WAS EVERYWHERE INTERRUPTED EXCEPT INDEED THAT IT WAS IN SOME CASES FOUND PRACTICABLE TO WORK THE LINES WITHOUT BATTERIES BY THE AGENCY OF THE EARTH CURRENTS ALONE
2388-153733-0021 SPARKS ISSUED FROM THE WIRES GORGEOUS AURORAS DRAPED THE SKIES IN SOLEMN CRIMSON OVER BOTH HEMISPHERES AND EVEN IN THE TROPICS THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE LOST ALL TRACE OF CONTINUITY IN ITS MOVEMENTS AND DARTED TO AND FRO AS IF STRICKEN WITH INEXPLICABLE PANIC
2388-153733-0022 THE COINCIDENCE WAS EVEN CLOSER AT THE VERY INSTANT OF THE SOLAR OUTBURST WITNESSED BY CARRINGTON AND HODGSON THE PHOTOGRAPHIC APPARATUS AT KEW REGISTERED A MARKED DISTURBANCE
2388-153733-0023 WHILE SHORTLY AFTER THE ENSUING MIDNIGHT THE ELECTRIC AGITATION CULMINATED
2388-153733-0024 AND LIGHTING UP THE ATMOSPHERE FROM POLE TO POLE WITH CORUSCATING SPLENDORS WHICH PERHAPS DIMLY RECALL THE TIMES WHEN OUR ANCIENT PLANET ITSELF SHONE AS A STAR
2388-153733-0025 OF THE ASSUMED CONNECTION BETWEEN SOLAR OUTBURSTS AND MAGNETIC STORMS ACCOMPANIED BY AURORAL DISPLAYS ON THE EARTH IT IS TRUE THAT THE LATE LORD KELVIN RAISED DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF A DIRECT MAGNETIC ACTION OF THE SUN UPON THE EARTH
2388-153733-0026 BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT AN INADMISSIBLE QUANTITY OF ENERGY WAS DEMANDED TO ACCOUNT FOR SUCH ACTION BUT NO CALCULATION LIKE THAT
2388-153733-0027 IS FINAL SINCE ALL CALCULATIONS DEPEND UPON THE VALIDITY OF THE DATA AND NO AUTHORITY IS UNSHAKABLE IN SCIENCE BECAUSE NO MAN CAN POSSESS OMNISCIENCE IT WAS LORD KELVIN WHO BUT A FEW YEARS BEFORE THE THING WAS ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED
2388-153733-0028 DECLARED THAT AERIAL NAVIGATION WAS AN IMPRACTICABLE DREAM AND DEMONSTRATED ITS IMPRACTICABILITY BY CALCULATION HOWEVER THE CONNECTION MAY BE BROUGHT ABOUT
2388-153733-0029 AND COINCIDENT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE THE INFERENCE
2388-153733-0030 SHOULD IT BE SO DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE SUN'S ENORMOUS ELECTRIC ENERGIES FIND A WAY TO US ALSO NO DOUBT THE IMPULSE COMING FROM THE SUN
2388-153733-0031 FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE SUN SPOT PERIOD SHORTENS THE AURORAL PERIOD SHORTENS TO PRECISELY THE SAME EXTENT AS THE SHORT SUN SPOT PERIODS USUALLY BRING THE MOST INTENSE OUTBREAKS OF SOLAR ACTIVITY SO THE CORRESPONDING SHORT AURORAL PERIODS
2388-153733-0032 ARE ATTENDED BY THE MOST VIOLENT MAGNETIC STORMS A SECULAR PERIOD OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO YEARS AFFECTING SUN SPOTS IS SAID TO HAVE ITS AURORAL DUPLICATE A SHORTER PERIOD OF FIFTY FIVE AND A HALF YEARS
2388-153733-0033 THEY BEGIN TO DESCEND WITH THE LINES OF FORCE CURVING DOWN TO MEET AT THE POLES AND ENCOUNTERING A PART OF THE ATMOSPHERE COMPARABLE IN DENSITY
2388-153733-0034 THEY PRODUCE A GLOW OF CATHODE RAYS THIS GLOW IS CONCEIVED TO REPRESENT THE AURORA WHICH MAY CONSEQUENTLY BE LIKENED TO A GIGANTIC EXHIBITION OF VACUUM TUBE LIGHTS ANYBODY WHO RECALLS HIS STUDENT DAYS IN THE COLLEGE LABORATORY
2388-153733-0035 AND WHO HAS WITNESSED A DISPLAY OF NORTHERN LIGHTS
2388-153733-0036 BEFORE ARRHENIUS ELABORATED HIS HYPOTHESIS WITHOUT INTENDING TO TREAT HIS INTERESTING THEORY AS MORE THAN A POSSIBLY CORRECT EXPLANATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF THE AURORA WE MAY CALL ATTENTION TO SOME APPARENTLY CONFIRMATORY FACTS
2388-153733-0037 AND FEWER IN JUNE AND DECEMBER
2388-153733-0038 THUS ONE THE PARTICLES ISSUING FROM THE SUN ARE SUPPOSED TO COME PRINCIPALLY FROM THE REGIONS WHOSE EXCITEMENT IS INDICATED BY THE PRESENCE OF SUN SPOTS
2388-153733-0039 THAT SUN SPOTS ARE COLUMNS OF IONIZED VAPORS
2388-153733-0040 THE EARTH IS DIRECTLY OVER THE SOLAR EQUATOR
2388-153733-0041 THIS AS WILL BE SEEN FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOVE IS IN STRICT ACCORD WITH THE OBSERVED VARIATIONS IN THE FREQUENCY OF AURORAE
2388-153733-0042 IN THE WINTER THAN IN THE SUMMER AND THE NUMBER OF PARTICLES REACHING IT WILL VARY LIKE THE INTENSITY OF LIGHT
2388-153733-0043 THE EARTH IS NEVER DIRECTLY OVER THE MOST ACTIVE REGIONS OF THE SUN SPOTS AND CONSEQUENTLY NEVER SUFFERS FROM THE MAXIMUM BOMBARDMENT OF CHARGED PARTICLES OF WHICH THE SUN IS CAPABLE INCESSANT AURORAL DISPLAYS
2388-153733-0044 FOR MONTHS ON END CRAZING THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE AND CONTINUALLY PUTTING THE TELEGRAPH AND CABLE LINES OUT OF COMMISSION TO SAY NOTHING OF THEIR EFFECT UPON WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY WOULD HARDLY ADD TO THE CHARMS OF TERRESTRIAL EXISTENCE
2388-153733-0045 FIRST THE NUMBER OF AURORAE ACCORDING TO HIS EXPLANATION
2388-153733-0046 SINCE THE LIGHT OF THE AURORA IS NEVER SUFFICIENTLY INTENSE TO BE VISIBLE IN THE PRESENCE OF DAYLIGHT BUT THE RECORDS OF THE MAGNETIC OBSERVATORIES CAN BE AND HAVE BEEN APPEALED TO FOR INFORMATION AND THEY INDICATE THAT THE FACTS ACTUALLY ACCORD WITH THE THEORY
2388-153733-0047 BEFORE THAN AFTER MIDNIGHT
2388-153733-0048 IS MORE FREQUENT IN YEARS WHEN AURORAE ARE MOST ABUNDANT
2388-153733-0049 IN THE ATMOSPHERE IN AN ABSOLUTELY DUSTLESS ATMOSPHERE
2388-153733-0050 LIKE THOSE SUPPOSED TO COME FROM THE SUN PLAY A MASTER PART IN THE PHENOMENA OF CLOUD FORMATION YET ANOTHER SINGULAR FACT ALMOST MYSTICAL IN ITS SUGGESTIONS MAY BE MENTIONED
2388-153733-0051 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS
2388-153733-0052 WE SHALL HOWEVER FIND ONE MORE APPLICATION OF IT IN THE NEXT CHAPTER
2393-144496-0000 WE WERE NOW DOWN IN WESTMINSTER
2393-144496-0001 AND WESTMINSTER ABBEY WAS THE POINT AT WHICH SHE PASSED FROM THE LIGHTS AND NOISE OF THE LEADING STREETS SHE PROCEEDED SO QUICKLY WHEN SHE GOT FREE OF THE TWO CURRENTS OF PASSENGERS SETTING TOWARDS AND FROM THE BRIDGE THAT BETWEEN THIS AND THE ADVANCE SHE HAD OF US WHEN SHE STRUCK OFF
2393-144496-0002 WE WERE IN THE NARROW WATER SIDE STREET BY MILLBANK BEFORE WE CAME UP WITH HER AT THAT MOMENT SHE CROSSED THE ROAD AS IF TO AVOID THE FOOTSTEPS THAT SHE HEARD SO CLOSE BEHIND AND WITHOUT LOOKING BACK PASSED ON EVEN MORE RAPIDLY
2393-144496-0003 A GLIMPSE OF THE RIVER THROUGH A DULL GATEWAY WHERE SOME WAGGONS WERE HOUSED FOR THE NIGHT SEEMED TO ARREST MY FEET I TOUCHED MY COMPANION WITHOUT SPEAKING AND WE BOTH FORBORE TO CROSS AFTER HER AND BOTH FOLLOWED ON THAT OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WAY
2393-144496-0004 KEEPING AS QUIETLY AS WE COULD IN THE SHADOW OF THE HOUSES BUT KEEPING VERY NEAR HER THERE WAS AND IS WHEN I WRITE AT THE END OF THAT LOW LYING STREET A DILAPIDATED LITTLE WOODEN BUILDING PROBABLY AN OBSOLETE OLD FERRY HOUSE
2393-144496-0005 ITS POSITION IS JUST AT THAT POINT WHERE THE STREET CEASES AND THE ROAD BEGINS TO LIE BETWEEN A ROW OF HOUSES AND THE RIVER AS SOON AS SHE CAME HERE AND SAW THE WATER SHE STOPPED AS IF SHE HAD COME TO HER DESTINATION AND PRESENTLY WENT SLOWLY ALONG BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
2393-144496-0006 LOOKING INTENTLY AT IT ALL THE WAY HERE I HAD SUPPOSED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO SOME HOUSE INDEED I HAD VAGUELY ENTERTAINED THE HOPE THAT THE HOUSE MIGHT BE IN SOME WAY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOST GIRL
2393-144496-0007 BUT THAT ONE DARK GLIMPSE OF THE RIVER THROUGH THE GATEWAY HAD INSTINCTIVELY PREPARED ME FOR HER GOING NO FARTHER THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS A DREARY ONE AT THAT TIME AS OPPRESSIVE SAD AND SOLITARY BY NIGHT AS ANY ABOUT LONDON
2393-144496-0008 A SLUGGISH DITCH DEPOSITED ITS MUD AT THE PRISON WALLS COARSE GRASS AND RANK WEEDS STRAGGLED OVER ALL THE MARSHY LAND IN THE VICINITY
2393-144496-0009 IN ONE PART CARCASES OF HOUSES INAUSPICIOUSLY BEGUN AND NEVER FINISHED ROTTED AWAY IN ANOTHER THE GROUND WAS CUMBERED WITH RUSTY IRON MONSTERS OF STEAM BOILERS WHEELS CRANKS PIPES FURNACES
2393-144496-0010 PADDLES ANCHORS DIVING BELLS WINDMILL SAILS AND I KNOW NOT WHAT STRANGE OBJECTS ACCUMULATED BY SOME SPECULATOR AND GROVELLING IN THE DUST UNDERNEATH WHICH
2393-144496-0011 HAVING SUNK INTO THE SOIL OF THEIR OWN WEIGHT IN WET WEATHER THEY HAD THE APPEARANCE OF VAINLY TRYING TO HIDE THEMSELVES THE CLASH AND GLARE OF SUNDRY FIERY WORKS UPON THE RIVER SIDE AROSE BY NIGHT TO DISTURB EVERYTHING
2393-144496-0012 EXCEPT THE HEAVY AND UNBROKEN SMOKE THAT POURED OUT OF THEIR CHIMNEYS SLIMY GAPS AND CAUSEWAYS WINDING AMONG OLD WOODEN PILES WITH A SICKLY SUBSTANCE CLINGING TO THE LATTER
2393-144496-0013 FLUTTERING ABOVE HIGH WATER MARK LED DOWN THROUGH THE OOZE AND SLUSH TO THE EBB TIDE THERE WAS A STORY THAT ONE OF THE PITS DUG FOR THE DEAD IN THE TIME OF THE GREAT PLAGUE WAS HEREABOUT
2393-144496-0014 AND A BLIGHTING INFLUENCE SEEMED TO HAVE PROCEEDED FROM IT OVER THE WHOLE PLACE OR ELSE IT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD GRADUALLY DECOMPOSED INTO THAT NIGHTMARE CONDITION OUT OF THE OVERFLOWINGS OF THE POLLUTED STREAM
2393-144496-0015 THE GIRL WE HAD FOLLOWED STRAYED DOWN TO THE RIVER'S BRINK AND STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THIS NIGHT PICTURE LONELY AND STILL LOOKING AT THE WATER THERE WERE SOME BOATS AND BARGES ASTRAND IN THE MUD
2393-144496-0016 AND THESE ENABLED US TO COME WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF HER WITHOUT BEING SEEN I THEN SIGNED TO MISTER PEGGOTTY TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS AND EMERGED FROM THEIR SHADE TO SPEAK TO HER I DID NOT APPROACH HER SOLITARY FIGURE WITHOUT TREMBLING
2393-144496-0017 FOR THIS GLOOMY END TO HER DETERMINED WALK AND THE WAY IN WHICH SHE STOOD ALMOST WITHIN THE CAVERNOUS SHADOW OF THE IRON BRIDGE LOOKING AT THE LIGHTS CROOKEDLY REFLECTED IN THE STRONG TIDE INSPIRED A DREAD WITHIN ME
2393-144496-0018 I THINK SHE WAS TALKING TO HERSELF I AM SURE ALTHOUGH ABSORBED IN GAZING AT THE WATER THAT HER SHAWL WAS OFF HER SHOULDERS AND THAT SHE WAS MUFFLING HER HANDS IN IT IN AN UNSETTLED AND BEWILDERED WAY
2393-144496-0019 I KNOW AND NEVER CAN FORGET THAT THERE WAS THAT IN HER WILD MANNER WHICH GAVE ME NO ASSURANCE BUT THAT SHE WOULD SINK BEFORE MY EYES UNTIL I HAD HER ARM WITHIN MY GRASP
2393-144496-0020 BUT A STRONGER HAND THAN MINE WAS LAID UPON HER AND WHEN SHE RAISED HER FRIGHTENED EYES AND SAW WHOSE IT WAS SHE MADE BUT ONE MORE EFFORT AND DROPPED DOWN BETWEEN US WE CARRIED HER AWAY FROM THE WATER TO WHERE THERE WERE SOME DRY STONES AND THERE LAID HER DOWN
2393-144496-0021 CRYING AND MOANING IN A LITTLE WHILE SHE SAT AMONG THE STONES HOLDING HER WRETCHED HEAD WITH BOTH HER HANDS OH THE RIVER SHE CRIED PASSIONATELY OH THE RIVER HUSH HUSH SAID I CALM YOURSELF
2393-144496-0022 BUT SHE STILL REPEATED THE SAME WORDS CONTINUALLY EXCLAIMING OH THE RIVER OVER AND OVER AGAIN I KNOW IT'S LIKE ME SHE EXCLAIMED I KNOW THAT I BELONG TO IT I KNOW THAT IT'S THE NATURAL COMPANY OF SUCH AS I AM
2393-144496-0023 IT COMES FROM COUNTRY PLACES WHERE THERE WAS ONCE NO HARM IN IT AND IT CREEPS THROUGH THE DISMAL STREETS DEFILED AND MISERABLE AND IT GOES AWAY LIKE MY LIFE TO A GREAT SEA THAT IS ALWAYS TROUBLED AND I FEEL THAT I MUST GO WITH IT
2393-144496-0025 OR THAT'S FIT FOR ME OH THE DREADFUL RIVER THE THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH MY MIND THAT IN THE FACE OF MY COMPANION AS HE LOOKED UPON HER WITHOUT SPEECH OR MOTION I MIGHT HAVE READ HIS NIECE'S HISTORY IF I HAD KNOWN NOTHING OF IT
2393-144496-0026 I NEVER SAW IN ANY PAINTING OR REALITY HORROR AND COMPASSION SO IMPRESSIVELY BLENDED HE SHOOK AS IF HE WOULD HAVE FALLEN AND HIS HAND I TOUCHED IT WITH MY OWN FOR HIS APPEARANCE ALARMED ME WAS DEADLY COLD
2393-144496-0027 SHE IS IN A STATE OF FRENZY I WHISPERED TO HIM SHE WILL SPEAK DIFFERENTLY IN A LITTLE TIME I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WOULD HAVE SAID IN ANSWER HE MADE SOME MOTION WITH HIS MOUTH AND SEEMED TO THINK HE HAD SPOKEN
2393-144496-0028 BUT HE HAD ONLY POINTED TO HER WITH HIS OUTSTRETCHED HAND A NEW BURST OF CRYING CAME UPON HER NOW IN WHICH SHE ONCE MORE HID HER FACE AMONG THE STONES AND LAY BEFORE US A PROSTRATE IMAGE OF HUMILIATION AND RUIN
2393-144496-0029 KNOWING THAT THIS STATE MUST PASS BEFORE WE COULD SPEAK TO HER WITH ANY HOPE I VENTURED TO RESTRAIN HIM WHEN HE WOULD HAVE RAISED HER AND WE STOOD BY IN SILENCE UNTIL SHE BECAME MORE TRANQUIL MARTHA SAID I THEN LEANING DOWN
2393-144496-0030 AND HELPING HER TO RISE SHE SEEMED TO WANT TO RISE AS IF WITH THE INTENTION OF GOING AWAY BUT SHE WAS WEAK AND LEANED AGAINST A BOAT DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS WHO IS WITH ME SHE SAID FAINTLY YES
2393-144496-0031 SHE SHOOK HER HEAD SHE LOOKED NEITHER AT HIM NOR AT ME BUT STOOD IN A HUMBLE ATTITUDE
2393-144496-0032 AND PRESSING THE OTHER CLENCHED AGAINST HER FOREHEAD ARE YOU COMPOSED ENOUGH SAID I TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT WHICH SO INTERESTED YOU I HOPE HEAVEN MAY REMEMBER IT THAT SNOWY NIGHT
2393-144496-0033 FOR NOT HAVING DRIVEN HER AWAY FROM THE DOOR I WANT TO SAY NOTHING FOR MYSELF SHE SAID AFTER A FEW MOMENTS I AM BAD I AM LOST I HAVE NO HOPE AT ALL BUT TELL HIM SIR SHE HAD SHRUNK AWAY FROM HIM
2393-144496-0034 IF YOU DON'T FEEL TOO HARD TO ME TO DO IT THAT I NEVER WAS IN
2393-144496-0035 IT HAS NEVER BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO YOU I RETURNED EARNESTLY RESPONDING TO HER EARNESTNESS IT WAS YOU IF I DON'T DECEIVE MYSELF SHE SAID IN A BROKEN VOICE THAT CAME INTO THE KITCHEN
2393-144496-0036 THE NIGHT SHE TOOK SUCH PITY ON ME WAS SO GENTLE TO ME DIDN'T SHRINK AWAY FROM ME LIKE ALL THE REST AND GAVE ME SUCH KIND HELP WAS IT YOU SIR IT WAS SAID I
2393-144496-0037 I SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE RIVER LONG AGO SHE SAID GLANCING AT IT WITH A TERRIBLE EXPRESSION IF ANY WRONG TO HER HAD BEEN UPON MY MIND I NEVER COULD HAVE KEPT OUT OF IT A SINGLE WINTER'S NIGHT IF I HAD NOT BEEN FREE OF ANY SHARE IN THAT
2393-144496-0038 THE CAUSE OF HER FLIGHT IS TOO WELL UNDERSTOOD I SAID YOU ARE INNOCENT OF ANY PART IN IT WE THOROUGHLY BELIEVE WE KNOW
2393-144496-0039 WITH MOST FORLORN REGRET FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS GOOD TO ME SHE NEVER SPOKE A WORD TO ME BUT WHAT WAS PLEASANT AND RIGHT
2393-144496-0040 KNOWING WHAT I AM MYSELF SO WELL WHEN I LOST EVERYTHING THAT MAKES LIFE DEAR THE WORST OF ALL MY THOUGHTS WAS THAT I WAS PARTED FOR EVER FROM HER MISTER PEGGOTTY STANDING WITH ONE HAND ON THE GUNWALE OF THE BOAT AND HIS EYES CAST DOWN
2393-144496-0041 AND WHEN I HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE THAT SNOWY NIGHT FROM SOME BELONGING TO OUR TOWN CRIED MARTHA THE BITTEREST THOUGHT IN ALL MY MIND
2393-144496-0042 SHE ONCE KEPT COMPANY WITH ME AND WOULD SAY I HAD CORRUPTED HER WHEN HEAVEN KNOWS I WOULD HAVE DIED TO HAVE BROUGHT BACK HER GOOD NAME LONG UNUSED TO ANY SELF CONTROL
2393-144496-0043 THE PIERCING AGONY OF HER REMORSE AND GRIEF WAS TERRIBLE TO HAVE DIED WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH WHAT CAN I SAY I WOULD HAVE LIVED SHE CRIED I WOULD HAVE LIVED TO BE OLD IN THE WRETCHED STREETS AND TO WANDER ABOUT
2393-144496-0044 AVOIDED IN THE DARK AND TO SEE THE DAY BREAK ON THE GHASTLY LINE OF HOUSES AND REMEMBER HOW THE SAME SUN USED TO SHINE INTO MY ROOM AND WAKE ME ONCE
2393-144496-0045 SINKING ON THE STONES SHE TOOK SOME IN EACH HAND AND CLENCHED THEM UP AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE GROUND THEM
2393-144496-0046 AND DROOPING HER HEAD AS IF IT WERE HEAVY WITH INSUPPORTABLE RECOLLECTIONS
2393-144496-0047 HOW CAN I GO ON AS I AM A SOLITARY CURSE TO MYSELF A LIVING DISGRACE TO EVERYONE I COME NEAR SUDDENLY SHE TURNED TO MY COMPANION STAMP UPON ME KILL ME WHEN SHE WAS YOUR PRIDE
2393-144496-0048 A SYLLABLE THAT COMES OUT OF MY LIPS IT WOULD BE A BURNING SHAME UPON YOU EVEN NOW IF SHE AND I EXCHANGED A WORD I DON'T COMPLAIN
2393-144496-0049 I KNOW THERE IS A LONG LONG WAY BETWEEN US I ONLY SAY WITH ALL MY GUILT AND WRETCHEDNESS UPON MY HEAD THAT I AM GRATEFUL TO HER FROM MY SOUL AND LOVE HER
2393-144496-0050 OH DON'T THINK THAT ALL THE POWER I HAD OF LOVING ANYTHING IS QUITE WORN OUT THROW ME AWAY AS ALL THE WORLD DOES KILL ME FOR BEING WHAT I AM AND HAVING EVER KNOWN HER BUT DON'T THINK THAT OF ME HE LOOKED UPON HER
2393-144496-0051 AND WHEN SHE WAS SILENT GENTLY RAISED HER MARTHA SAID MISTER PEGGOTTY GOD FORBID AS I SHOULD JUDGE YOU FORBID AS I OF ALL MEN SHOULD DO THAT MY GIRL

2393-144496-0055 HE REPEATED STEADILY FUR SHE'S MORE DEAR TO ME NOW MARTHA THAN SHE WAS DEAR AFORE
2393-144496-0056 BUT OTHERWISE REMAINED QUIET I HAVE HEERD HER TELL SAID MISTER PEGGOTTY AS YOU WAS EARLY LEFT FATHERLESS AND MOTHERLESS WITH NO FRIEND FUR TO TAKE IN A ROUGH SEAFARING WAY THEIR PLACE
2393-144496-0057 MAYBE YOU CAN GUESS THAT IF YOU'D HAD SUCH A FRIEND YOU'D HAVE GOT INTO A WAY OF BEING FOND OF HIM IN COURSE OF TIME
2393-144496-0058 AS SHE WAS SILENTLY TREMBLING HE PUT HER SHAWL CAREFULLY ABOUT HER TAKING IT UP FROM THE GROUND FOR THAT PURPOSE WHEREBY SAID HE I KNOW BOTH AS SHE WOULD GO TO THE WURELD'S FURDEST END WITH ME IF SHE COULD ONCE SEE ME AGAIN
2393-144496-0059 TO KEEP OFF SEEING ME FOR THOUGH SHE AIN'T NO CALL TO DOUBT MY LOVE AND DOEN'T AND DOEN'T
2393-144496-0060 THERE'S SHAME STEPS IN AND KEEPS BETWIXT US I READ IN EVERY WORD OF HIS PLAIN IMPRESSIVE WAY OF DELIVERING HIMSELF NEW EVIDENCE OF HIS HAVING THOUGHT OF THIS ONE TOPIC IN EVERY FEATURE IT PRESENTED
2393-144496-0061 ACCORDING TO OUR RECKONING HE PROCEEDED
2393-144496-0062 AND MINE SHE IS LIKE ONE DAY TO MAKE HER OWN POOR SOLITARY COURSE TO LONDON

2393-144496-0064 AND MAY HEAVEN REWARD YOU SHE LOOKED AT HIM HASTILY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME AS IF SHE WERE DOUBTFUL OF WHAT HE HAD SAID WILL YOU TRUST ME SHE ASKED IN A LOW VOICE OF ASTONISHMENT FULL AND FREE SAID MISTER PEGGOTTY
2393-144496-0065 IF I SHOULD EVER FIND HER SHELTER HER IF I HAVE ANY SHELTER TO DIVIDE WITH HER AND THEN WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE COME TO YOU AND BRING YOU TO HER SHE ASKED HURRIEDLY WE BOTH REPLIED TOGETHER YES
2393-144496-0066 SHE LIFTED UP HER EYES AND SOLEMNLY DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD DEVOTE HERSELF TO THIS TASK FERVENTLY AND FAITHFULLY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER WAVER IN IT NEVER BE DIVERTED FROM IT NEVER RELINQUISH IT WHILE THERE WAS ANY CHANCE OF HOPE
2393-144496-0067 IF SHE WERE NOT TRUE TO IT MIGHT THE
2393-144496-0068 IN ITS PASSING AWAY FROM HER LEAVE HER MORE FORLORN AND MORE DESPAIRING IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE THAN SHE HAD BEEN UPON THE RIVER'S BRINK THAT NIGHT AND THEN MIGHT ALL HELP HUMAN AND DIVINE RENOUNCE HER EVERMORE
2393-144496-0069 SHE DID NOT RAISE HER VOICE ABOVE HER BREATH OR ADDRESS US BUT SAID THIS TO THE NIGHT SKY THEN STOOD PROFOUNDLY QUIET
2393-144496-0070 WHERE WE WERE TO BE COMMUNICATED WITH IF OCCASION SHOULD ARISE UNDER A DULL LAMP IN THE ROAD I WROTE OUR TWO ADDRESSES ON A LEAF OF MY POCKET BOOK WHICH I TORE OUT AND GAVE TO HER AND WHICH SHE PUT IN HER POOR BOSOM
2393-144496-0071 I ASKED HER WHERE SHE LIVED HERSELF SHE SAID AFTER A PAUSE IN NO PLACE LONG IT WERE BETTER NOT TO KNOW MISTER PEGGOTTY SUGGESTING TO ME IN A WHISPER WHAT HAD ALREADY OCCURRED TO MYSELF I TOOK OUT MY PURSE
2393-144496-0072 BUT I COULD NOT PREVAIL UPON HER TO ACCEPT ANY MONEY NOR COULD I EXACT ANY PROMISE FROM HER THAT SHE WOULD DO SO AT ANOTHER TIME I REPRESENTED TO HER THAT MISTER PEGGOTTY COULD NOT BE CALLED FOR ONE IN HIS CONDITION POOR
2393-144496-0073 DEPENDING ON HER OWN RESOURCES SHOCKED US BOTH SHE CONTINUED STEADFAST IN THIS PARTICULAR HIS INFLUENCE UPON HER WAS EQUALLY POWERLESS WITH MINE SHE GRATEFULLY THANKED HIM BUT REMAINED INEXORABLE
2393-144496-0074 THERE MAY BE WORK TO BE GOT SHE SAID I'LL TRY AT LEAST TAKE SOME ASSISTANCE I RETURNED UNTIL YOU HAVE TRIED I COULD NOT DO WHAT I HAVE PROMISED FOR MONEY SHE REPLIED I COULD NOT TAKE IT IF I WAS STARVING
2393-144496-0075 TO GIVE ME MONEY WOULD BE TO TAKE AWAY YOUR TRUST TO TAKE AWAY THE OBJECT THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
2393-144496-0076 IN THE NAME OF THE GREAT JUDGE SAID I
2393-144496-0077 DISMISS THAT TERRIBLE IDEA WE CAN ALL DO SOME GOOD IF WE WILL SHE TREMBLED AND HER LIP SHOOK AND HER FACE WAS PALER AS SHE ANSWERED
2393-144496-0078 IT SEEMS TOO BOLD IF ANY GOOD SHOULD COME OF ME I MIGHT BEGIN TO HOPE FOR NOTHING BUT HARM HAS EVER COME OF MY DEEDS YET I AM TO BE TRUSTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG WHILE
2393-144496-0079 WITH MY MISERABLE LIFE ON ACCOUNT OF WHAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME TO TRY FOR I KNOW NO MORE AND I CAN SAY NO MORE AGAIN SHE REPRESSED THE TEARS THAT HAD BEGUN TO FLOW AND PUTTING OUT HER TREMBLING HAND AND TOUCHING MISTER PEGGOTTY
2393-144496-0080 AS IF THERE WAS SOME HEALING VIRTUE IN HIM WENT AWAY ALONG THE DESOLATE ROAD SHE HAD BEEN ILL PROBABLY FOR A LONG TIME I OBSERVED UPON THAT CLOSER OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVATION THAT SHE WAS WORN AND HAGGARD
2393-144496-0081 WE FOLLOWED HER AT A SHORT DISTANCE OUR WAY LYING IN THE SAME DIRECTION UNTIL WE CAME BACK INTO THE LIGHTED AND POPULOUS STREETS I HAD SUCH IMPLICIT CONFIDENCE IN HER DECLARATION THAT I THEN PUT IT TO MISTER PEGGOTTY WHETHER IT WOULD NOT SEEM
2393-144496-0082 IN THE ONSET LIKE DISTRUSTING HER TO FOLLOW HER ANY FARTHER HE BEING OF THE SAME MIND AND EQUALLY RELIANT ON HER WE SUFFERED HER TO TAKE HER OWN ROAD AND TOOK OURS WHICH WAS TOWARDS HIGHGATE
2393-144496-0083 THERE WAS A NEW AND THOUGHTFUL COMPASSION IN HIM THAT I WAS AT NO LOSS TO INTERPRET IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN I ARRIVED AT HOME I HAD REACHED MY OWN GATE AND WAS STANDING LISTENING FOR THE DEEP BELL OF SAINT PAUL'S THE SOUND OF WHICH I THOUGHT HAD BEEN BORNE TOWARDS ME
2393-144496-0084 AMONG THE MULTITUDE OF STRIKING CLOCKS WHEN I WAS RATHER SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THE DOOR OF MY AUNT'S COTTAGE WAS OPEN AND THAT A FAINT LIGHT IN THE ENTRY WAS SHINING OUT ACROSS THE ROAD THINKING THAT MY AUNT MIGHT HAVE RELAPSED INTO ONE OF HER OLD ALARMS
2393-144496-0085 AND MIGHT BE WATCHING THE PROGRESS OF SOME IMAGINARY CONFLAGRATION IN THE DISTANCE I WENT TO SPEAK TO HER IT WAS WITH VERY GREAT SURPRISE THAT I SAW A MAN STANDING IN HER LITTLE GARDEN
2393-144496-0086 HE HAD A GLASS AND BOTTLE IN HIS HAND AND WAS IN THE ACT OF DRINKING I STOPPED SHORT AMONG THE THICK FOLIAGE OUTSIDE FOR THE MOON WAS UP NOW THOUGH OBSCURED AND I RECOGNIZED THE MAN WHOM I HAD ONCE SUPPOSED TO BE A DELUSION OF MISTER DICK'S
2393-144496-0087 HE WAS EATING AS WELL AS DRINKING AND SEEMED TO EAT WITH A HUNGRY APPETITE
2393-144496-0088 AS IF IT WERE THE FIRST TIME HE HAD SEEN IT AFTER STOOPING TO PUT THE BOTTLE ON THE GROUND HE LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS AND LOOKED ABOUT
2393-144496-0089 THE LIGHT IN THE PASSAGE WAS OBSCURED FOR A MOMENT AND MY AUNT CAME OUT SHE WAS AGITATED

2397-162239-0009 WAVING ADIEU AND GODSPEED TO WEBB WHO HAD HALTED IN SADDLE ON REACHING THE OPPOSITE BANK AND WAS WATCHING HIS LITTLE COLUMN THROUGH THE FORD
2397-162239-0010 BUT SCORNING DISQUALIFICATION OF ANY KIND NOW THAT DANGER MENACED THEIR BELOVED CAPTAIN AND THEIR COMRADES OF THE SORREL TROOP IN ALL THE REGIMENT
2397-162239-0011 BROKE FROM THE HOLD OF THE HALF HEARTED ATTENDANT TORE OVER TO K TROOP BARRACKS DEMANDING HIS KIT OF SERGEANT SCHREIBER AND FINDING THE QUARTERS DESERTED THE MEN ALL GONE TO STABLES DARED TO BURST INTO THAT MAGNATE'S OWN ROOM
2397-162239-0012 IN SEARCH OF HIS ARMS AND CLOTHING AND THEREBY ROUSED A HEAVILY SLEEPING SOLDIER WHO DAMNED HIM SAVAGELY UNTIL THROUGH WILD RAVING HE GATHERED THAT SOME GRAVE DANGER MENACED CAPTAIN RAY EVEN HIS BEFUDDLED SENSES COULD FATHOM THAT
2397-162239-0013 AND WAS OFF LIKE A SHOT TO THE STABLES IT WAS LONG BEFORE HE FOUND HIS HORSE FOR THE GUARD HAD TAKEN KILMAINE TO F TROOP'S STABLES AND KENNEDY HAD BEEN HOUSED BY K
2397-162239-0014 IT WAS LONGER STILL BEFORE HE COULD PERSUADE THE GUARD THAT HE HAD A RIGHT AS HE PUT IT TO RIDE AFTER THE MAJOR NOT UNTIL CAPTAIN DADE HAD BEEN CONSULTED WOULD THEY LET HIM GO
2397-162239-0015 YOU FOLLOW THE MAJOR'S YOU CAN'T MISS HIM
2397-162239-0016 YOU SHOULD CATCH HIM BY NOON THEN GIVE HIM THIS THIS WAS A COPY OF A LATE DESPATCH JUST IN FROM LARAMIE SAYING THAT THE REVOLT HAD REACHED THE SIOUX AT THE AGENCIES AND RESERVATIONS ON THE WHITE EARTH
2397-162239-0017 AND WOULD DEMAND THE ATTENTION OF EVERY MAN AT THE POST NO REINFORCEMENT THEREFORE COULD BE LOOKED FOR FROM THAT QUARTER UNTIL THE GENERAL CAME IT WAS NO SURPRISE TO DADE IT COULD BE NONE TO WEBB FOR OLD RED CLOUD HAD EVER BEEN AN ENEMY
2397-162239-0018 NO WONDER THE OLD WAR CHIEF BACKED HIM WITH ABUNDANT FOOD AMMUNITION AND EAGER WARRIORS SENT FROM HOME BUT IT WAS AFTER ELEVEN WHEN KENNEDY DROVE HIS STILL WEARIED HORSE THROUGH THE PLATTE AND FAR TO THE NORTH SAW THE DUN DUST CLOUD
2397-162239-0019 THAT TOLD WHERE WEBB'S LITTLE COLUMN WAS TROTTING HARD TO THE SUPPORT OF THE SORRELS HIS HEAD WAS ACHING
2397-162239-0020 AT THREE IN THE MORNING HE FELT EQUAL TO FIGHTING THE WHOLE SIOUX NATION
2397-162239-0021 THE DUST CLOUD WAS ONLY PARTIALLY VISIBLE NOW HIDDEN BY THE RIDGE A FEW MILES AHEAD WHEN OVER THAT VERY RIDGE PROBABLY FOUR MILES AWAY TO THE RIGHT FRONT KENNEDY SAW COMING AT SPEED A SINGLE RIDER AND REINED TO THE NORTHEAST TO MEET HIM
2397-162239-0022 BLAKE AND HIS MEN HAD GONE FAR IN THAT DIRECTION
2397-162239-0023 THE LITTLE IRISH VETERAN SORE HEADED AND IN EVIL MOOD AND A BIG WILD EYED SCARE FACED TROOPER NEW TO THE FRONTIER
2397-162239-0024 HE FAIRLY WHIRLED THE BIG TROOPER AROUND AND DESPITE FEARSOME PROTESTS BORE HIM ONWARD TOWARD THE RIDGE SWIFT QUESTIONING AS THEY RODE
2397-162239-0025 WHY THE ROOKIE GASPED IN EXPLANATION THAT HE WAS ON STABLE GUARD AND THE CAPTAIN TOOK THE FIRST SIX MEN IN SIGHT HOW HAPPENED IT THAT THE CAPTAIN GOT SO FAR AHEAD OF HIM THERE WAS NO KEEPIN UP WITH THE CAPTAIN
2397-162239-0026 UNTIL ALL OF A SUDDEN AS THEY FILED ROUND A LITTLE KNOLL THE THREE INDIANS THEY'D BEEN CHASIN TURNED ABOUT AND LET EM HAVE IT
2397-162239-0027 TWICE WOULD THE BIG FELLOW HAVE BROKEN AWAY AND AGAIN SPURRED FOR HOME BUT THE LITTLE GAME COCK HELD HIM SAVAGELY TO HIS WORK AND SO TOGETHER AT LAST THEY NEARED THE CURTAINING RIDGE
2397-162239-0028 OF THE LOW GROUND BEYOND HALF WAY DOWN THE LONG GRADUAL SLOPE IN A SHALLOW LITTLE DIP POSSIBLY AN OLD BUFFALO WALLOW TWO OR THREE HORSES WERE SPRAWLED AND A TINY TONGUE OF FLAME AND BLUE SMOKE
2397-162239-0029 BEHIND THIS ROLLING PARAPET CROUCHED A FEATHERED WARRIOR AND FARTHER STILL AWAY SWEEPING AND CIRCLING ON THEIR METTLESOME STEEDS THREE MORE SAVAGE BRAVES WERE DARTING AT SPEED ALREADY THEY HAD SIGHTED THE COMING REINFORCEMENTS
2397-162239-0030 AND DOWN THEY WENT FULL TILT AT THE SIOUX YET HEADING TO COVER AND REACH THE BELEAGUERED PARTY IN THE HOLLOW SOMEONE OF THE BESIEGED WAVED A HAT ON HIGH
2397-162239-0031 AND THEN CAME A PRETTY EXHIBIT OF SAVAGE DARING AND DEVOTION DISDAINFUL OF THE COMING TROOPERS AND OF THE SWIFT FIRE NOW BLAZING AT THEM FROM THE PIT THE TWO MOUNTED WARRIORS LASHED THEIR PONIES TO MAD GALLOP
2397-162239-0032 AND BORE DOWN STRAIGHT FOR THEIR IMPERILLED BROTHER CROUCHING BEHIND THE STRICKEN PINTO NEVER SWERVING NEVER HALTING HARDLY CHECKING SPEED BUT BENDING LOW OVER AND BEHIND THEIR CHARGERS NECKS THE TWO YOUNG BRAVES SWEPT ONWARD AND WITH WILD WHOOP OF TRIUMPH
2397-162239-0033 CHALLENGE AND HATRED GATHERED UP AND SLUNG BEHIND THE RIDER OF THE HEAVIER PONY THE AGILE AND BEDIZENED FORM ON THE TURF
2397-162239-0034 AND FIRED THRICE INTO EMPTY SPACE AND A SHOUT OF WRATH AND RENEWED CHALLENGE TO COME BACK AND FIGHT IT OUT RANG OUT AFTER THE SIOUX FOR TO THE AMAZE OF THE LATELY BESIEGED TO THE IMPOTENT FURY OF THE IRISHMAN IN UNMISTAKABLE YET MOSTLY UNQUOTABLE ENGLISH
2397-162239-0035 THE CRIPPLED WARRIOR WAS YELLING MINGLED THREAT AND IMPRECATION WHO WAS IT KENNEDY AND WHERE DID YOU EVER SEE HIM BEFORE A MOMENT LATER DEMANDED CAPTAIN BLAKE ALMOST BEFORE HE COULD GRASP THE IRISHMAN'S HANDS AND SHOWER HIS THANKS
2397-162239-0036 WITH LONG FRINGES AND HEAVY CRUSTING OF BRILLIANT BEADS PICKED IT UP BY THAT PONY YONDER SIR ANSWERED THE CORPORAL WITH A SALUTE BEG PARDON SIR BUT WILL THE CAPTAIN TAKE MY HORSE
2397-162239-0038 THERE WERE NONE TO SPARE TO SEND SO FAR AND THOUGH THREE WARRIORS ONE OF THEM RAGING AND CLAMORING FOR FURTHER ATTEMPT DESPITE HIS WOUNDS HOVERED ABOUT THE RETIRING PARTY BLAKE AND HIS FELLOWS WITHIN ANOTHER HOUR WERE IN SIGHT OF THE SHELTERING WALLS OF FRAYNE
2397-162239-0039 AND AFTER A LAST LONG RANGE SWAPPING OF SHOTS WITH BLAKE AND MEISNER FOOTING IT MOST OF THE WAY
2397-162239-0040 THE SWIFT FLOWING PLATTE THEY WERE STILL THREE MILES OUT WHEN BLAKE FOUND LEISURE TO EXAMINE THE CONTENTS OF THAT BEADED POUCH
2397-162253-0000 THE STEWARD SHOUTED FROM THE HOSPITAL PORCH THAT EAGLE WING THE PRISONER PATIENT HAD ESCAPED THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW DESPITE ITS HEIGHT ABOVE THE SLOPING GROUND A LITTLE LADDER BORROWED FROM THE QUARTERMASTER'S CORRAL WAS FOUND A MOMENT LATER
2397-162253-0001 AN INDIAN PONY SADDLED SIOUX FASHION WAS CAUGHT RUNNING RIDERLESS TOWARD THE TRADER'S BACK GATE HIS HORSEHAIR BRIDLE TORN HALF WAY FROM HIS SHAGGY HEAD
2397-162253-0002 NO SOONER HEARD THAT MOREAU WAS GONE THAN HE RUSHED HIS STABLE GUARD TO THE SADDLEROOM AND IN FIFTEEN MINUTES HAD NOT ONLY HIS OWN SQUAD BUT HALF A DOZEN CASUAL TROOPERS CIRCLING THE POST IN SEARCH OF THE TRAIL
2397-162253-0003 POST ORDNANCE QUARTERMASTER AND COMMISSARY SERGEANTS MANY OF THE POST GUARD AND MOST OF THE POST LAUNDRESSES HAD GATHERED SOME SILENT ANXIOUS AND BEWILDERED SOME EXCITEDLY BABBLING
2397-162253-0004 ESTHER DADE VERY PALE AND SOMEWHAT OUT OF BREATH WAS TRYING WITH QUIET SELF POSSESSION TO ANSWER THE MYRIAD QUESTIONS POURED AT HER WHILE DOCTOR WALLER WAS MINISTERING TO THE DAZED AND MOANING SENTRY
2397-162253-0005 THE CLOAK AND SKIRTS OF CIVILIZATION HAD BEEN FOUND BENEATH THE WINDOW OF THE DESERTED ROOM AND WERE EXHIBITED AS A MEANS OF BRINGING TO HIS SENSES
2397-162253-0006 AND TO AN IMPULSIVE REPLY FROM THE LIPS OF MISSUS HAY
2397-162253-0007 THEN RISING AND STEPPING ASIDE THE LONG SUFFERING WOMAN REVEALED THE PALLID SENSELESS FACE
2397-162253-0008 NANETTE LA FLEUR A LONG LOST SISTER'S ONLY CHILD
2397-162253-0009 HE HAD UNEARTHED AN ALMOST FORGOTTEN LEGEND OF OLD FORT LARAMIE
2397-162253-0010 THE DISCOVERY OF THE LADDER AND OF THE ESCAPE OF THE PRISONER FOR WHOM HE WAS ACCOUNTABLE HAD FILLED HIM WITH DISMAY YET FOR THE MOMENT FAILED TO STAGGER HIS INDOMITABLE SELF ESTEEM
2397-162253-0011 SHE WAS THE GENERAL'S PROTEGEE NOT HIS AND THE GENERAL MUST SHOULDER THE BLAME EVEN WHEN FLINT SAW NANETTE SELF CONVICTED THROUGH HER VERY GARB AND HER PRESENCE AT THE SCENE OF THE FINAL STRUGGLE EVEN WHEN ASSURED IT WAS SHE AND NOT THE LITTLE
2397-162253-0012 ALL THIS WOULD BE ENDANGERED BY HIS ATTEMPT TO REJOIN THE WARRIORS ON THE WARPATH THE MAJOR ORDERED THE INSTANT ARREST OF THE SENTRY STATIONED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOSPITAL ROOM SHUT OUT BY THE MAJOR'S OWN ACT FROM ALL POSSIBILITY OF SEEING WHAT WAS GOING ON WITHIN
2397-162253-0013 DEMANDED OF DOCTOR WALLER THAT HE SAY IN SO MANY WORDS THAT THE GAG AND WRIST THONGS ON THE PROSTRATE SENTRY HAD NOT BEEN SELF APPLIED WALLER IMPASSIVELY POINTED TO THE HUGE LUMP AT THE BASE OF THE SUFFERER'S SKULL
2397-162253-0014 BUT THESE HAD REALIZED THEIR UNPOPULARITY AFTER THE BATTLE ON THE ELK AND HAD DEPARTED FOR OTHER CLIMES CRAPAUD WAS STILL UNDER GUARD
2397-162253-0015 AND FOLLOWED CLOSE BY A MOCCASINED MAN
2397-162253-0016 AND THE MOCCASINED FEET OF A MAN AND WOMAN HAD SCURRIED DOWN THE BLUFF FROM THE HOSPITAL WINDOW TO MEET THEM WEST OF FOSTER'S SHANTY THEN THERE HAD BEEN CONFUSION TROUBLE OF SOME KIND ONE PONY PURSUED A SHORT DISTANCE HAD BROKEN AWAY
2397-162253-0017 THE OTHERS HAD GONE POUNDING OUT SOUTHEASTWARD UP THE SLOPE AND OUT OVER THE UPLANDS THEN DOWN AGAIN IN WIDE SWEEP THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE LITTLE RIVULET
2397-162253-0018 AND ALONG THE LOW BENCH SOUTHWEST OF THE FORT CROSSING THE ROCK SPRINGS ROAD AND STRIKING FURTHER ON DIAGONALLY THE RAWLINS TRAIL WHERE CRABB AND HIS FELLOWS HAD FOUND IT AND FOLLOWED
2397-162253-0019 FOR AT LAST IT WAS FOUND THROUGH THE THICK AND LUSTROUS HAIR THAT SHE TOO HAD BEEN STRUCK A HARSH AND CRUEL BLOW
2397-162253-0020 THAT ONE REASON PROBABLY WHY SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO OPPOSE NO STOUTER RESISTANCE TO SO SLENDER A GIRL AS ESTHER DADE WAS THAT SHE WAS ALREADY HALF DAZED THROUGH THE STROKE OF SOME BLUNT HEAVY WEAPON WIELDED PROBABLY BY HIM SHE WAS RISKING ALL TO SAVE
2397-162253-0021 MEANTIME THE MAJOR HAD BEEN PURSUING HIS INVESTIGATIONS SCHMIDT THE SOLDIER SENTRY IN FRONT OF MOREAU'S DOOR A SIMPLE HEARTED TEUTON OF IRREPROACHABLE CHARACTER TEARFULLY PROTESTED AGAINST HIS INCARCERATION
2397-162253-0022 TO PRESUME TO REOPEN IT THE MAJOR SAID TO THE LADY HE WOULD RETURN FOR HER SOON AFTER TEN AND THE LADY SMILINGLY SCHMIDT DID NOT SAY HOW SMILINGLY HOW BEWITCHINGLY SMILINGLY
2397-162253-0023 AND ALL THAT TIME THE DOOR WAS OPEN THE PRISONER ON THE BED IN HIS BLANKETS THE LAMP BRIGHTLY BURNING IT WAS NEAR TATTOO WHEN SHE RETURNED
2397-162253-0024 WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND OUT SHE CAME THE SAME CLOAK AROUND HER YET SHE LOOKED DIFFERENT SOMEHOW AND MUST HAVE TIPTOED
2397-162253-0025 SHE DIDN'T SEEM QUITE SO TALL EITHER AND THAT WAS ALL FOR HE NEVER KNEW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT IT TILL THE STEWARD CAME RUNNING TO TELL OF THE ESCAPE SO SCHMIDT COULD THROW BUT LITTLE LIGHT UPON THE SITUATION SAVE TO FLINT HIMSELF
2397-162253-0026 A LADY CAME FROM THE SOUTH OF THE BUILDING AS THOUGH SHE WERE GOING DOWN TO SUDSTOWN MISSUS FOSTER HAD GONE DOWN NOT LONG BEFORE AND HOGAN WITH A LANTERN AND TWO OFFICERS LADIES BUT THIS ONE CAME ALL ALONE AND SPOKE TO HIM PLEASANT LIKE
2397-162253-0027 AND SAID SHE WAS SO SORRY HE COULDN'T BE AT THE DANCE SHE'D BEEN SEEING THE SICK AND WOUNDED IN HOSPITAL SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO BRING SOME WINE AND JELLIES
2397-162253-0028 THEN SHE LAUGHED AND SAID GOOD NIGHT AND WENT ON TO THE HOSPITAL WHAT BECAME OF THE WINE SHE HAD POURED OUT THIS FROM THE GRIM AND HITHERTO SILENT DOCTOR SEATED BY THE BEDSIDE SHE MUST HAVE TOSSED IT OUT OR DRUNK IT HERSELF PERHAPS SIX DIDN'T KNOW
2397-162253-0029 CERTAINLY NO TRACE OF IT COULD BE FOUND IN THE SNOW THEN NOTHING HAPPENED FOR AS MUCH AS TWENTY MINUTES OR SO AND HE WAS OVER TOWARD THE SOUTH END OF HIS POST BUT FACING TOWARD THE HOSPITAL WHEN SHE CAME AGAIN DOWN THE STEPS
2397-162253-0030 AND STARS AND BOMBS AND THAT WAS ALL HE KNEW TILL THEY BEGAN TALKING TO HIM HERE IN HOSPITAL SOMETHING HAD HIT HIM FROM BEHIND BUT HE COULDN'T TELL WHAT FLINT'S NERVE WAS FAILING HIM FOR HERE WAS CONFIRMATION OF THE GENERAL'S THEORY
2397-162253-0031 AND TWAS THE LATTER THAT BADE THE MAJOR SUMMON THE GIRL AND DEMAND OF HER
2397-162253-0032 OR A GOOD IMITATION OF ONE AS ON TWO OCCASIONS THE MAID HAD PEEKED AND SEEN HER DOWN STAIRS AT THE BACK DOOR IN THE DEAD HOURS OF THE NIGHT OR THE VERY EARLY MORNING THAT WAS WHEN SHE FIRST CAME THEN SINCE THE RECAPTURE MISS MC GRATH FELT CONFIDENT
2397-162253-0033 THE BOYS DO BE ALL TALKIN ABOUT THE NIGHT IN FACT THAT STABBER'S BAND SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE PLATTE RAY'S TROOP FOLLOWING AT DAWN
2397-162253-0034 MISS MC GRATH HADN'T BEEN SPYING OF COURSE BECAUSE HER ROOM WAS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE BEYOND THE KITCHEN BUT HOW DID THE LITTLE HEEL TRACKS GET ON THE VERANDA ROOF THE ROAD DUST ON THE MATTING UNDER THE WINDOW THE VINE TWIGS IN THAT QUARE MADE SKIRT NEVER WORN BY DAY
2397-162253-0035 EVERYBODY AT FRAYNE WELL KNEW BY THIS TIME THAT SHE HAD SO RIDDEN AT FORT FRAYNE WAS KNOWN TO NO OFFICER OR LADY OF THE GARRISON THEN PRESENT BUT BELIEVED BY MISS MC GRATH BECAUSE OF CERTAIN INEXPRESSIBLES
2397-162253-0036 THE MORNING CAPTAIN BLAKE WAS HAVING HIS CHASE AFTER THE INDIANS
2397-162253-0037 ALL THIS AND MORE DID MISS MC GRATH REVEAL BEFORE BEING PERMITTED TO RETURN TO THE SANCTITY OF HER CHAMBER AND FLINT FELT THE GROUND SINKING BENEATH HIS FEET
2397-162253-0038 THIS INDIAN LEADER OF WHOM EXAMPLE PROMPT AND SHARP WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN MADE UNLESS THE GENERAL AND THE ENDS OF JUSTICE WERE DEFEATED BUT WHAT STUNG THE MAJOR MOST OF ALL WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN FAIRLY VICTIMIZED HOODWINKED
2397-162253-0039 THAT THE MAJOR SOUGHT HER ON THE MORROW
2397-162253-0040 AND THAT THOUGH HE WOULD NOT PLACE THE TRADER'S NIECE WITHIN A GARRISON CELL HE SHOULD HOLD HER PRISONER BENEATH THE TRADER'S ROOF TO AWAIT THE ACTION OF SUPERIOR AUTHORITY ON THE GRIEVOUS CHARGES LODGED AT HER DOOR SHE WAS ABLE TO BE UP SAID MISS MC GRATH
2397-162253-0041 NOT ONLY UP BUT DOWN DOWN IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM LOOKING BLITHER AND MORE LIKE HERSELF THAN SHE HAD BEEN SINCE SHE WAS BROUGHT HOME
2397-162253-0042 COLD STERN AND ACCUSING THE OTHER LOOKED SQUARELY AT HIM WITH FEARLESS GLITTERING EYES
2397-162253-0043 AND THAT YOU WILL NEVER LAY HANDS ON HIM AGAIN THAT'S WHERE YOU ARE IN ERROR MISS FLOWER WAS THE MAJOR'S CALM COLD BLOODED YET REJOICEFUL REPLY IT WAS FOR THIS INDEED THAT HE HAD COME
2401-144485-0000 I WAS NOT DISPIRITED NOW I WAS NOT AFRAID OF THE SHABBY COAT AND HAD NO YEARNINGS AFTER GALLANT GREYS MY WHOLE MANNER OF THINKING OF OUR LATE MISFORTUNE WAS CHANGED WHAT I HAD TO DO WAS TO SHOW MY AUNT THAT HER PAST GOODNESS TO ME
2401-144485-0001 HAD NOT BEEN THROWN AWAY ON AN INSENSIBLE UNGRATEFUL OBJECT WHAT I HAD TO DO WAS TO TURN THE PAINFUL DISCIPLINE OF MY YOUNGER DAYS TO ACCOUNT BY GOING TO WORK WITH A RESOLUTE AND STEADY HEART WHAT I HAD TO DO
2401-144485-0002 WAS TO TAKE MY WOODMAN'S AXE IN MY HAND AND CLEAR MY OWN WAY THROUGH THE FOREST OF DIFFICULTY BY CUTTING DOWN THE TREES UNTIL I CAME TO DORA AND I WENT ON AT A MIGHTY RATE AS IF IT COULD BE DONE BY WALKING WHEN I FOUND MYSELF ON THE FAMILIAR HIGHGATE ROAD
2401-144485-0003 PURSUING SUCH A DIFFERENT ERRAND FROM THAT OLD ONE OF PLEASURE WITH WHICH IT WAS ASSOCIATED IT SEEMED AS IF A COMPLETE CHANGE HAD COME ON MY WHOLE LIFE BUT THAT DID NOT DISCOURAGE ME WITH THE NEW LIFE CAME NEW PURPOSE NEW INTENTION
2401-144485-0004 GREAT WAS THE LABOUR PRICELESS THE REWARD DORA WAS THE REWARD AND DORA MUST BE WON I GOT INTO SUCH A TRANSPORT THAT I FELT QUITE SORRY MY COAT WAS NOT A LITTLE SHABBY ALREADY I WANTED TO BE CUTTING AT THOSE TREES IN THE FOREST OF DIFFICULTY
2401-144485-0005 UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHOULD PROVE MY STRENGTH I HAD A GOOD MIND TO ASK AN OLD MAN IN WIRE SPECTACLES WHO WAS BREAKING STONES UPON THE ROAD TO LEND ME HIS HAMMER FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND LET ME BEGIN TO BEAT A PATH TO DORA OUT OF GRANITE
2401-144485-0006 I STIMULATED MYSELF INTO SUCH A HEAT AND GOT SO OUT OF BREATH THAT I FELT AS IF I HAD BEEN EARNING I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IN THIS STATE I WENT INTO A COTTAGE THAT I SAW WAS TO LET AND EXAMINED IT NARROWLY FOR I FELT IT NECESSARY TO BE PRACTICAL
2401-144485-0007 IT WOULD DO FOR ME AND DORA ADMIRABLY WITH A LITTLE FRONT GARDEN FOR JIP TO RUN ABOUT IN AND BARK AT THE TRADESPEOPLE THROUGH THE RAILINGS AND A CAPITAL ROOM UPSTAIRS FOR MY AUNT I CAME OUT AGAIN HOTTER AND FASTER THAN EVER
2401-144485-0008 AND DASHED UP TO HIGHGATE AT SUCH A RATE THAT I WAS THERE AN HOUR TOO EARLY AND THOUGH I HAD NOT BEEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO STROLL ABOUT TO COOL MYSELF BEFORE I WAS AT ALL PRESENTABLE MY FIRST CARE AFTER PUTTING MYSELF UNDER THIS NECESSARY COURSE OF PREPARATION
2401-144485-0009 WAS TO FIND THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE IT WAS NOT IN THAT PART OF HIGHGATE WHERE MISSUS STEERFORTH LIVED BUT QUITE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE LITTLE TOWN WHEN I HAD MADE THIS DISCOVERY I WENT BACK IN AN ATTRACTION I COULD NOT RESIST
2401-144485-0010 TO A LANE BY MISSUS STEERFORTH'S AND LOOKED OVER THE CORNER OF THE GARDEN WALL HIS ROOM WAS SHUT UP CLOSE THE CONSERVATORY DOORS WERE STANDING OPEN AND ROSA DARTLE WAS WALKING BAREHEADED WITH A QUICK IMPETUOUS STEP
2401-144485-0011 UP AND DOWN A GRAVEL WALK ON ONE SIDE OF THE LAWN SHE GAVE ME THE IDEA OF SOME FIERCE THING THAT WAS DRAGGING THE LENGTH OF ITS CHAIN TO AND FRO UPON A BEATEN TRACK AND WEARING ITS HEART OUT I CAME SOFTLY AWAY FROM MY PLACE OF OBSERVATION
2401-144485-0012 AND AVOIDING THAT PART OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND WISHING I HAD NOT GONE NEAR IT STROLLED ABOUT UNTIL IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK THE CHURCH WITH THE SLENDER SPIRE THAT STANDS ON THE TOP OF THE HILL NOW WAS NOT THERE THEN TO TELL ME THE TIME
2401-144485-0013 AN OLD RED BRICK MANSION USED AS A SCHOOL WAS IN ITS PLACE AND A FINE OLD HOUSE IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO GO TO SCHOOL AT AS I RECOLLECT IT WHEN I APPROACHED THE DOCTOR'S COTTAGE
2401-144485-0015 AND TWO OR THREE ROOKS WERE ON THE GRASS LOOKING AFTER HIM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN WRITTEN TO ABOUT HIM BY THE CANTERBURY ROOKS AND WERE OBSERVING HIM CLOSELY IN CONSEQUENCE KNOWING THE UTTER HOPELESSNESS OF ATTRACTING HIS ATTENTION FROM THAT DISTANCE
2401-144485-0016 I MADE BOLD TO OPEN THE GATE AND WALK AFTER HIM SO AS TO MEET HIM WHEN HE SHOULD TURN ROUND WHEN HE DID AND CAME TOWARDS ME HE LOOKED AT ME THOUGHTFULLY FOR A FEW MOMENTS EVIDENTLY WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT ME AT ALL
2401-144485-0017 AND THEN HIS BENEVOLENT FACE EXPRESSED EXTRAORDINARY PLEASURE AND HE TOOK ME BY BOTH HANDS WHY MY DEAR COPPERFIELD SAID THE DOCTOR YOU ARE A MAN HOW DO YOU DO I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU MY DEAR COPPERFIELD HOW VERY MUCH YOU HAVE IMPROVED YOU ARE QUITE
2401-144485-0018 YES DEAR ME I HOPED HE WAS WELL AND MISSUS STRONG TOO OH DEAR YES SAID THE DOCTOR ANNIE'S QUITE WELL AND SHE'LL BE DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU YOU WERE ALWAYS HER FAVOURITE SHE SAID SO LAST NIGHT WHEN I SHOWED HER YOUR LETTER
2401-144485-0019 AND YES TO BE SURE YOU RECOLLECT MISTER JACK MALDON COPPERFIELD PERFECTLY SIR OF COURSE SAID THE DOCTOR TO BE SURE HE'S PRETTY WELL TOO HAS HE COME HOME SIR I INQUIRED FROM INDIA
2401-144485-0020 SAID THE DOCTOR YES MISTER JACK MALDON COULDN'T BEAR THE CLIMATE MY DEAR MISSUS MARKLEHAM YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN MISSUS MARKLEHAM FORGOTTEN THE OLD SOLDIER AND IN THAT SHORT TIME MISSUS MARKLEHAM SAID THE DOCTOR WAS QUITE VEXED ABOUT HIM POOR THING
2401-144485-0021 SO WE HAVE GOT HIM AT HOME AGAIN AND WE HAVE BOUGHT HIM A LITTLE PATENT PLACE WHICH AGREES WITH HIM MUCH BETTER I KNEW ENOUGH OF MISTER JACK MALDON TO SUSPECT FROM THIS ACCOUNT THAT IT WAS A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS NOT MUCH TO DO AND WHICH WAS PRETTY WELL PAID
2401-144485-0022 THE DOCTOR WALKING UP AND DOWN WITH HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND HIS KIND FACE TURNED ENCOURAGINGLY TO MINE WENT ON NOW MY DEAR COPPERFIELD IN REFERENCE TO THIS PROPOSAL OF YOURS IT'S VERY GRATIFYING AND AGREEABLE TO ME I AM SURE
2401-144485-0023 BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOU COULD DO BETTER YOU ACHIEVED DISTINCTION YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WERE WITH US YOU ARE QUALIFIED FOR MANY GOOD THINGS YOU HAVE LAID A FOUNDATION THAT ANY EDIFICE MAY BE RAISED UPON AND IS IT NOT A PITY THAT YOU SHOULD DEVOTE THE SPRING TIME OF YOUR LIFE
2401-144485-0024 TO SUCH A POOR PURSUIT AS I CAN OFFER I BECAME VERY GLOWING AGAIN AND EXPRESSING MYSELF IN A RHAPSODICAL STYLE I AM AFRAID URGED MY REQUEST STRONGLY REMINDING THE DOCTOR THAT I HAD ALREADY A PROFESSION
2401-144485-0025 WELL WELL SAID THE DOCTOR THAT'S TRUE CERTAINLY YOUR HAVING A PROFESSION AND BEING ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN STUDYING IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BUT MY GOOD YOUNG FRIEND WHAT'S SEVENTY POUNDS A YEAR IT DOUBLES OUR INCOME DOCTOR STRONG SAID I
2401-144485-0026 DEAR ME REPLIED THE DOCTOR TO THINK OF THAT NOT THAT I MEAN TO SAY IT'S RIGIDLY LIMITED TO SEVENTY POUNDS A YEAR BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS CONTEMPLATED MAKING ANY YOUNG FRIEND I MIGHT THUS EMPLOY A PRESENT TOO UNDOUBTEDLY SAID THE DOCTOR
2401-144485-0027 STILL WALKING ME UP AND DOWN WITH HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER I HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN AN ANNUAL PRESENT INTO ACCOUNT MY DEAR TUTOR SAID I NOW REALLY WITHOUT ANY NONSENSE TO WHOM I OWE MORE OBLIGATIONS ALREADY THAN I EVER CAN ACKNOWLEDGE
2401-144485-0028 NO NO INTERPOSED THE DOCTOR PARDON ME IF YOU WILL TAKE SUCH TIME AS I HAVE AND THAT IS MY MORNINGS AND EVENINGS AND CAN THINK IT WORTH SEVENTY POUNDS A YEAR YOU WILL DO ME SUCH A SERVICE AS I CANNOT EXPRESS DEAR ME SAID THE DOCTOR INNOCENTLY
2401-144485-0029 TO THINK THAT SO LITTLE SHOULD GO FOR SO MUCH DEAR DEAR AND WHEN YOU CAN DO BETTER YOU WILL ON YOUR WORD NOW SAID THE DOCTOR WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS MADE A VERY GRAVE APPEAL TO THE HONOUR OF US BOYS ON MY WORD SIR I RETURNED
2401-144485-0030 ANSWERING IN OUR OLD SCHOOL MANNER THEN BE IT SO SAID THE DOCTOR CLAPPING ME ON THE SHOULDER AND STILL KEEPING HIS HAND THERE AS WE STILL WALKED UP AND DOWN AND I SHALL BE TWENTY TIMES HAPPIER SIR SAID I WITH A LITTLE I HOPE INNOCENT FLATTERY
2401-144485-0031 IF MY EMPLOYMENT IS TO BE ON THE DICTIONARY THE DOCTOR STOPPED SMILINGLY CLAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AGAIN AND EXCLAIMED WITH A TRIUMPH MOST DELIGHTFUL TO BEHOLD AS IF I HAD PENETRATED TO THE PROFOUNDEST DEPTHS OF MORTAL SAGACITY
2401-144485-0032 MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND YOU HAVE HIT IT IT IS THE DICTIONARY HOW COULD IT BE ANYTHING ELSE HIS POCKETS WERE AS FULL OF IT AS HIS HEAD IT WAS STICKING OUT OF HIM IN ALL DIRECTIONS HE TOLD ME THAT SINCE HIS RETIREMENT FROM SCHOLASTIC LIFE
2401-144485-0033 HE HAD BEEN ADVANCING WITH IT WONDERFULLY AND THAT NOTHING COULD SUIT HIM BETTER THAN THE PROPOSED ARRANGEMENTS FOR MORNING AND EVENING WORK AS IT WAS HIS CUSTOM TO WALK ABOUT IN THE DAYTIME WITH HIS CONSIDERING CAP ON HIS PAPERS WERE IN A LITTLE CONFUSION
2401-144485-0034 IN CONSEQUENCE OF MISTER JACK MALDON HAVING LATELY PROFFERED HIS OCCASIONAL SERVICES AS AN AMANUENSIS AND NOT BEING ACCUSTOMED TO THAT OCCUPATION BUT WE SHOULD SOON PUT RIGHT WHAT WAS AMISS AND GO ON SWIMMINGLY
2401-144485-0035 AFTERWARDS WHEN WE WERE FAIRLY AT OUR WORK I FOUND MISTER JACK MALDON'S EFFORTS MORE TROUBLESOME TO ME THAN I HAD EXPECTED AS HE HAD NOT CONFINED HIMSELF TO MAKING NUMEROUS MISTAKES BUT HAD SKETCHED SO MANY SOLDIERS AND LADIES HEADS
2401-144485-0036 OVER THE DOCTOR'S MANUSCRIPT THAT I OFTEN BECAME INVOLVED IN LABYRINTHS OF OBSCURITY THE DOCTOR WAS QUITE HAPPY IN THE PROSPECT OF OUR GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON THAT WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE AND WE SETTLED TO BEGIN NEXT MORNING AT SEVEN O'CLOCK
2401-144485-0037 WE WERE TO WORK TWO HOURS EVERY MORNING AND TWO OR THREE HOURS EVERY NIGHT EXCEPT ON SATURDAYS WHEN I WAS TO REST ON SUNDAYS OF COURSE I WAS TO REST ALSO AND I CONSIDERED THESE VERY EASY TERMS
2401-144485-0038 OUR PLANS BEING THUS ARRANGED TO OUR MUTUAL SATISFACTION THE DOCTOR TOOK ME INTO THE HOUSE TO PRESENT ME TO MISSUS STRONG WHOM WE FOUND IN THE DOCTOR'S NEW STUDY DUSTING HIS BOOKS A FREEDOM WHICH HE NEVER PERMITTED ANYBODY ELSE TO TAKE WITH THOSE SACRED FAVOURITES
2401-144485-0039 THEY HAD POSTPONED THEIR BREAKFAST ON MY ACCOUNT AND WE SAT DOWN TO TABLE TOGETHER WE HAD NOT BEEN SEATED LONG WHEN I SAW AN APPROACHING ARRIVAL IN MISSUS STRONG'S FACE BEFORE I HEARD ANY SOUND OF IT A GENTLEMAN ON HORSEBACK CAME TO THE GATE
2401-144485-0040 AND LEADING HIS HORSE INTO THE LITTLE COURT WITH THE BRIDLE OVER HIS ARM AS IF HE WERE QUITE AT HOME TIED HIM TO A RING IN THE EMPTY COACH HOUSE WALL AND CAME INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR WHIP IN HAND IT WAS MISTER JACK MALDON
2401-144485-0041 AND MY IMPRESSION MUST BE RECEIVED WITH DUE ALLOWANCE MISTER JACK SAID THE DOCTOR COPPERFIELD MISTER JACK MALDON SHOOK HANDS WITH ME BUT NOT VERY WARMLY I BELIEVED AND WITH AN AIR OF LANGUID PATRONAGE AT WHICH I SECRETLY TOOK GREAT UMBRAGE
2401-144485-0042 BUT HIS LANGUOR ALTOGETHER WAS QUITE A WONDERFUL SIGHT EXCEPT WHEN HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO HIS COUSIN ANNIE HAVE YOU BREAKFASTED THIS MORNING MISTER JACK SAID THE DOCTOR I HARDLY EVER TAKE BREAKFAST SIR HE REPLIED
2401-144485-0043 WITH HIS HEAD THROWN BACK IN AN EASY CHAIR I FIND IT BORES ME IS THERE ANY NEWS TODAY INQUIRED THE DOCTOR NOTHING AT ALL SIR REPLIED MISTER MALDON THERE'S AN ACCOUNT ABOUT THE PEOPLE BEING HUNGRY AND DISCONTENTED DOWN IN THE NORTH
2401-144485-0044 BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS BEING HUNGRY AND DISCONTENTED SOMEWHERE THE DOCTOR LOOKED GRAVE
2401-144485-0045 THEN THERE'S NO NEWS AT ALL AND NO NEWS THEY SAY IS GOOD NEWS THERE'S A LONG STATEMENT IN THE PAPERS SIR ABOUT A MURDER OBSERVED MISTER MALDON BUT SOMEBODY IS ALWAYS BEING MURDERED AND I DIDN'T READ IT
2401-144485-0046 I HAVE KNOWN IT VERY FASHIONABLE INDEED I HAVE SEEN IT DISPLAYED WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT I HAVE ENCOUNTERED SOME FINE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHO MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN BORN CATERPILLARS PERHAPS IT IMPRESSED ME THE MORE THEN
2401-144485-0047 BECAUSE IT WAS NEW TO ME BUT IT CERTAINLY DID NOT TEND TO EXALT MY OPINION OF OR TO STRENGTHEN MY CONFIDENCE IN MISTER JACK MALDON
2401-144485-0048 IT'S THE LAST GOOD NIGHT THERE WILL BE THIS SEASON AND THERE'S A SINGER THERE WHOM SHE REALLY OUGHT TO HEAR SHE IS PERFECTLY EXQUISITE BESIDES WHICH SHE IS SO CHARMINGLY UGLY RELAPSING INTO LANGUOR THE DOCTOR EVER PLEASED WITH WHAT WAS LIKELY TO PLEASE HIS YOUNG WIFE
2401-144485-0049 TURNED TO HER AND SAID YOU MUST GO ANNIE YOU MUST GO I WOULD RATHER NOT SHE SAID TO THE DOCTOR I PREFER TO REMAIN AT HOME I WOULD MUCH RATHER REMAIN AT HOME WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER COUSIN SHE THEN ADDRESSED ME
2401-144485-0050 AND ASKED ME ABOUT AGNES AND WHETHER SHE SHOULD SEE HER AND WHETHER SHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO COME THAT DAY AND WAS SO MUCH DISTURBED THAT I WONDERED HOW EVEN THE DOCTOR BUTTERING HIS TOAST COULD BE BLIND TO WHAT WAS SO OBVIOUS BUT HE SAW NOTHING
2401-144485-0051 HE TOLD HER GOOD NATUREDLY THAT SHE WAS YOUNG AND OUGHT TO BE AMUSED AND ENTERTAINED AND MUST NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO BE MADE DULL BY A DULL OLD FELLOW MOREOVER HE SAID HE WANTED TO HEAR HER SING ALL THE NEW SINGER'S SONGS TO HIM
2401-144485-0052 AND HOW COULD SHE DO THAT WELL UNLESS SHE WENT SO THE DOCTOR PERSISTED IN MAKING THE ENGAGEMENT FOR HER AND MISTER JACK MALDON WAS TO COME BACK TO DINNER THIS CONCLUDED HE WENT TO HIS PATENT PLACE I SUPPOSE
2401-144485-0053 BUT AT ALL EVENTS WENT AWAY ON HIS HORSE LOOKING VERY IDLE I WAS CURIOUS TO FIND OUT NEXT MORNING WHETHER SHE HAD BEEN SHE HAD NOT BUT HAD SENT INTO LONDON TO PUT HER COUSIN OFF AND HAD GONE OUT IN THE AFTERNOON TO SEE AGNES
2401-144485-0054 AND HAD PREVAILED UPON THE DOCTOR TO GO WITH HER AND THEY HAD WALKED HOME BY THE FIELDS THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THE EVENING BEING DELIGHTFUL I WONDERED THEN WHETHER SHE WOULD HAVE GONE IF AGNES HAD NOT BEEN IN TOWN AND WHETHER AGNES HAD SOME GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER TOO
2401-144485-0055 SHE DID NOT LOOK VERY HAPPY I THOUGHT BUT IT WAS A GOOD FACE OR A VERY FALSE ONE I OFTEN GLANCED AT IT FOR SHE SAT IN THE WINDOW ALL THE TIME WE WERE AT WORK AND MADE OUR BREAKFAST WHICH WE TOOK BY SNATCHES AS WE WERE EMPLOYED
2401-144485-0056 WHEN I LEFT AT NINE O'CLOCK SHE WAS KNEELING ON THE GROUND AT THE DOCTOR'S FEET PUTTING ON HIS SHOES AND GAITERS FOR HIM THERE WAS A SOFTENED SHADE UPON HER FACE THROWN FROM SOME GREEN LEAVES OVERHANGING THE OPEN WINDOW OF THE LOW ROOM
2401-144485-0057 AND I THOUGHT ALL THE WAY TO DOCTORS COMMONS OF THE NIGHT WHEN I HAD SEEN IT LOOKING AT HIM AS HE READ I WAS PRETTY BUSY NOW UP AT FIVE IN THE MORNING AND HOME AT NINE OR TEN AT NIGHT BUT I HAD INFINITE SATISFACTION IN BEING SO CLOSELY ENGAGED
2401-144485-0058 AND NEVER WALKED SLOWLY ON ANY ACCOUNT AND FELT ENTHUSIASTICALLY THAT THE MORE I TIRED MYSELF THE MORE I WAS DOING TO DESERVE DORA I HAD NOT REVEALED MYSELF IN MY ALTERED CHARACTER TO DORA YET BECAUSE SHE WAS COMING TO SEE MISS MILLS IN A FEW DAYS
2401-144485-0059 AND I DEFERRED ALL I HAD TO TELL HER UNTIL THEN MERELY INFORMING HER IN MY LETTERS ALL OUR COMMUNICATIONS WERE SECRETLY FORWARDED THROUGH MISS MILLS THAT I HAD MUCH TO TELL HER IN THE MEANTIME I PUT MYSELF ON A SHORT ALLOWANCE OF BEAR'S GREASE
2401-144485-0060 WHOLLY ABANDONED SCENTED SOAP AND LAVENDER WATER AND SOLD OFF THREE WAISTCOATS AT A PRODIGIOUS SACRIFICE AS BEING TOO LUXURIOUS FOR MY STERN CAREER NOT SATISFIED WITH ALL THESE PROCEEDINGS BUT BURNING WITH IMPATIENCE TO DO SOMETHING MORE
2401-144485-0061 I WENT TO SEE TRADDLES NOW LODGING UP BEHIND THE PARAPET OF A HOUSE IN CASTLE STREET HOLBORN MISTER DICK WHO HAD BEEN WITH ME TO HIGHGATE TWICE ALREADY AND HAD RESUMED HIS COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE DOCTOR I TOOK WITH ME
2401-144485-0062 I TOOK MISTER DICK WITH ME BECAUSE ACUTELY SENSITIVE TO MY AUNT'S REVERSES AND SINCERELY BELIEVING THAT NO GALLEY SLAVE OR CONVICT WORKED AS I DID HE HAD BEGUN TO FRET AND WORRY HIMSELF OUT OF SPIRITS AND APPETITE AS HAVING NOTHING USEFUL TO DO
2401-144485-0063 IN THIS CONDITION HE FELT MORE INCAPABLE OF FINISHING THE MEMORIAL THAN EVER AND THE HARDER HE WORKED AT IT THE OFTENER THAT UNLUCKY HEAD OF KING CHARLES THE FIRST GOT INTO IT SERIOUSLY APPREHENDING THAT HIS MALADY WOULD INCREASE
2401-144485-0064 UNLESS WE PUT SOME INNOCENT DECEPTION UPON HIM AND CAUSED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS USEFUL OR UNLESS WE COULD PUT HIM IN THE WAY OF BEING REALLY USEFUL WHICH WOULD BE BETTER I MADE UP MY MIND TO TRY IF TRADDLES COULD HELP US
2401-144485-0065 BEFORE WE WENT I WROTE TRADDLES A FULL STATEMENT OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND TRADDLES WROTE ME BACK A CAPITAL ANSWER EXPRESSIVE OF HIS SYMPATHY AND FRIENDSHIP WE FOUND HIM HARD AT WORK WITH HIS INKSTAND AND PAPERS
2401-144485-0066 REFRESHED BY THE SIGHT OF THE FLOWER POT STAND AND THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE IN A CORNER OF THE SMALL APARTMENT HE RECEIVED US CORDIALLY AND MADE FRIENDS WITH MISTER DICK IN A MOMENT MISTER DICK PROFESSED AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY OF HAVING SEEN HIM BEFORE
2401-144485-0067 AND WE BOTH SAID VERY LIKELY THE FIRST SUBJECT ON WHICH I HAD TO CONSULT TRADDLES WAS THIS I HAD HEARD THAT MANY MEN DISTINGUISHED IN VARIOUS PURSUITS HAD BEGUN LIFE BY REPORTING THE DEBATES IN PARLIAMENT
2401-144485-0068 TRADDLES HAVING MENTIONED NEWSPAPERS TO ME AS ONE OF HIS HOPES I HAD PUT THE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND TOLD TRADDLES IN MY LETTER THAT I WISHED TO KNOW HOW I COULD QUALIFY MYSELF FOR THIS PURSUIT
2401-144485-0069 THAT THE MERE MECHANICAL ACQUISITION NECESSARY EXCEPT IN RARE CASES FOR THOROUGH EXCELLENCE IN IT THAT IS TO SAY A PERFECT AND ENTIRE COMMAND OF THE MYSTERY OF SHORT HAND WRITING AND READING WAS ABOUT EQUAL IN DIFFICULTY TO THE MASTERY OF SIX LANGUAGES
2401-144485-0070 TRADDLES REASONABLY SUPPOSED THAT THIS WOULD SETTLE THE BUSINESS BUT I ONLY FEELING THAT HERE INDEED WERE A FEW TALL TREES TO BE HEWN DOWN IMMEDIATELY RESOLVED TO WORK MY WAY ON TO DORA THROUGH THIS THICKET AXE IN HAND
2401-144485-0071 I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU MY DEAR TRADDLES SAID I I'LL BEGIN TOMORROW TRADDLES LOOKED ASTONISHED AS HE WELL MIGHT BUT HE HAD NO NOTION AS YET OF MY RAPTUROUS CONDITION I'LL BUY A BOOK SAID I
2401-144485-0072 WITH A GOOD SCHEME OF THIS ART IN IT I'LL WORK AT IT AT THE COMMONS WHERE I HAVEN'T HALF ENOUGH TO DO I'LL TAKE DOWN THE SPEECHES IN OUR COURT FOR PRACTICE TRADDLES MY DEAR FELLOW I'LL MASTER IT DEAR ME SAID TRADDLES OPENING HIS EYES
2401-144485-0073 I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE SUCH A DETERMINED CHARACTER COPPERFIELD I DON'T KNOW HOW HE SHOULD HAVE HAD FOR IT WAS NEW ENOUGH TO ME I PASSED THAT OFF AND BROUGHT MISTER DICK ON THE CARPET YOU SEE SAID MISTER DICK WISTFULLY IF I COULD EXERT MYSELF MISTER TRADDLES
2401-144485-0074 IF I COULD BEAT A DRUM OR BLOW ANYTHING POOR FELLOW I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED SUCH AN EMPLOYMENT IN HIS HEART TO ALL OTHERS TRADDLES WHO WOULD NOT HAVE SMILED FOR THE WORLD REPLIED COMPOSEDLY BUT YOU ARE A VERY GOOD PENMAN SIR
2401-144485-0075 YOU TOLD ME SO COPPERFIELD EXCELLENT SAID I AND INDEED HE WAS HE WROTE WITH EXTRAORDINARY NEATNESS DON'T YOU THINK SAID TRADDLES YOU COULD COPY WRITINGS SIR IF I GOT THEM FOR YOU MISTER DICK LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT ME
2401-144485-0076 EH TROTWOOD I SHOOK MY HEAD MISTER DICK SHOOK HIS AND SIGHED TELL HIM ABOUT THE MEMORIAL SAID MISTER DICK I EXPLAINED TO TRADDLES THAT THERE WAS A DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING KING CHARLES THE FIRST OUT OF MISTER DICK'S MANUSCRIPTS
2401-144485-0077 MISTER DICK IN THE MEANWHILE LOOKING VERY DEFERENTIALLY AND SERIOUSLY AT TRADDLES AND SUCKING HIS THUMB BUT THESE WRITINGS YOU KNOW THAT I SPEAK OF ARE ALREADY DRAWN UP AND FINISHED SAID TRADDLES AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION MISTER DICK HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM
2401-144485-0078 WOULDN'T THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE COPPERFIELD AT ALL EVENTS WOULDN'T IT BE WELL TO TRY THIS GAVE US NEW HOPE TRADDLES AND I LAYING OUR HEADS TOGETHER APART WHILE MISTER DICK ANXIOUSLY WATCHED US FROM HIS CHAIR
2401-144485-0079 WE CONCOCTED A SCHEME IN VIRTUE OF WHICH WE GOT HIM TO WORK NEXT DAY WITH TRIUMPHANT SUCCESS ON A TABLE BY THE WINDOW IN BUCKINGHAM STREET WE SET OUT THE WORK TRADDLES PROCURED FOR HIM WHICH WAS TO MAKE I FORGET HOW MANY COPIES
2401-144485-0080 OF A LEGAL DOCUMENT ABOUT SOME RIGHT OF WAY AND ON ANOTHER TABLE WE SPREAD THE LAST UNFINISHED ORIGINAL OF THE GREAT MEMORIAL OUR INSTRUCTIONS TO MISTER DICK WERE THAT HE SHOULD COPY EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD BEFORE HIM WITHOUT THE LEAST DEPARTURE FROM THE ORIGINAL
2401-144485-0081 AND THAT WHEN HE FELT IT NECESSARY TO MAKE THE SLIGHTEST ALLUSION TO KING CHARLES THE FIRST HE SHOULD FLY TO THE MEMORIAL WE EXHORTED HIM TO BE RESOLUTE IN THIS AND LEFT MY AUNT TO OBSERVE HIM MY AUNT REPORTED TO US AFTERWARDS
2401-144485-0082 THAT AT FIRST HE WAS LIKE A MAN PLAYING THE KETTLE DRUMS AND CONSTANTLY DIVIDED HIS ATTENTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO BUT THAT FINDING THIS CONFUSE AND FATIGUE HIM AND HAVING HIS COPY THERE PLAINLY BEFORE HIS EYES HE SOON SAT AT IT IN AN ORDERLY BUSINESS LIKE MANNER
2401-144485-0083 AND POSTPONED THE MEMORIAL TO A MORE CONVENIENT TIME IN A WORD ALTHOUGH WE TOOK GREAT CARE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE NO MORE TO DO THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM AND ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT BEGIN WITH THE BEGINNING OF A WEEK HE EARNED BY THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY NIGHT TEN SHILLINGS AND NINE PENCE
2401-144485-0084 TO ALL THE SHOPS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO CHANGE THIS TREASURE INTO SIXPENCES OR HIS BRINGING THEM TO MY AUNT ARRANGED IN THE FORM OF A HEART UPON A WAITER WITH TEARS OF JOY AND PRIDE IN HIS EYES HE WAS LIKE ONE UNDER THE PROPITIOUS INFLUENCE OF A CHARM
2401-144485-0085 FROM THE MOMENT OF HIS BEING USEFULLY EMPLOYED AND IF THERE WERE A HAPPY MAN IN THE WORLD THAT SATURDAY NIGHT IT WAS THE GRATEFUL CREATURE WHO THOUGHT MY AUNT THE MOST WONDERFUL WOMAN IN EXISTENCE AND ME THE MOST WONDERFUL YOUNG MAN NO STARVING NOW TROTWOOD SAID MISTER DICK
2401-144485-0086 SHAKING HANDS WITH ME IN A CORNER I'LL PROVIDE FOR HER SIR AND HE FLOURISHED HIS TEN FINGERS IN THE AIR AS IF THEY WERE TEN BANKS I HARDLY KNOW WHICH WAS THE BETTER PLEASED TRADDLES OR I IT REALLY SAID TRADDLES
2401-144485-0087 PUT MISTER MICAWBER QUITE OUT OF MY HEAD THE LETTER MISTER MICAWBER NEVER MISSED ANY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY OF WRITING A LETTER WAS ADDRESSED TO ME BY THE KINDNESS OF T TRADDLES ESQUIRE OF THE INNER TEMPLE IT RAN THUS
2401-144485-0088 MY DEAR COPPERFIELD YOU MAY POSSIBLY NOT BE UNPREPARED TO RECEIVE THE INTIMATION THAT SOMETHING HAS TURNED UP I MAY HAVE MENTIONED TO YOU ON A FORMER OCCASION THAT I WAS IN EXPECTATION OF SUCH AN EVENT I AM ABOUT TO ESTABLISH MYSELF
2401-144485-0089 IN ONE OF THE PROVINCIAL TOWNS OF OUR FAVOURED ISLAND WHERE THE SOCIETY MAY BE DESCRIBED AS A HAPPY ADMIXTURE OF THE AGRICULTURAL AND THE CLERICAL IN IMMEDIATE CONNEXION WITH ONE OF THE LEARNED PROFESSIONS MISSUS MICAWBER AND OUR OFFSPRING WILL ACCOMPANY ME
2401-144485-0090 OUR ASHES AT A FUTURE PERIOD WILL PROBABLY BE FOUND COMMINGLED IN THE CEMETERY ATTACHED TO A VENERABLE PILE FOR WHICH THE SPOT TO WHICH I REFER HAS ACQUIRED A REPUTATION SHALL I SAY FROM CHINA TO PERU
2654-158744-0000 ALTHOUGH THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS OF THIS NEW HISTORY HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE FORTUNES AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES OF LADY EUSTACE THE HISTORIAN BEGS HIS READERS NOT TO BELIEVE
2654-158744-0001 IS TO ASSUME THE DIGNITY OF HEROINE IN THE FORTHCOMING PAGES
2654-158744-0002 POOR LIZZIE GREYSTOCK AS MEN DOUBLE HER OWN AGE AND WHO HAD KNOWN HER AS A FORWARD CAPRICIOUS SPOILT CHILD IN HER FATHER'S LIFETIME WOULD STILL CALL HER SHE DID SO MANY THINGS MADE SO MANY EFFORTS
2654-158744-0003 CAUSED SO MUCH SUFFERING TO OTHERS AND SUFFERED SO MUCH HERSELF THROUGHOUT THE SCENES WITH WHICH WE ARE ABOUT TO DEAL THAT THE STORY CAN HARDLY BE TOLD WITHOUT GIVING HER THAT PROMINENCE OF PLACE
2654-158744-0004 NOR DOES THE CHRONICLER DARE TO PUT FORWARD LUCY MORRIS AS A HEROINE
2654-158744-0005 SHALL STALK IN AMONG US AT SOME CONSIDERABLY LATER PERIOD OF THE NARRATIVE
2654-158744-0006 AND HAVE WORKED HIMSELF UP TO A STATE OF MIND FIT FOR THE RECEPTION OF NOBLE ACTING AND NOBLE SPEAKING IN THE MEANTIME LET IT BE UNDERSTOOD THAT POOR LITTLE LUCY MORRIS WAS A GOVERNESS IN THE HOUSE OF OLD LADY FAWN
2654-158744-0007 WHEN OUR BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WIDOW ESTABLISHED HERSELF IN MOUNT STREET LADY EUSTACE AND LUCY MORRIS HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR MANY YEARS HAD INDEED BEEN CHILDREN TOGETHER
2654-158744-0008 THERE HAVING BEEN SOME OLD FAMILY FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE GREYSTOCKS AND THE MORRISES WHEN THE ADMIRAL'S WIFE WAS LIVING LUCY HAD AS A LITTLE GIRL OF EIGHT OR NINE BEEN HER GUEST SHE HAD OFTEN BEEN A GUEST AT THE DEANERY
2654-158744-0009 WHEN LADY EUSTACE HAD GONE DOWN TO THE BISHOP'S PALACE AT BOBSBOROUGH IN ORDER THAT AN HEIR TO THE EUSTACES MIGHT BE BORN UNDER AN AUSPICIOUS ROOF LUCY MORRIS WAS WITH THE GREYSTOCKS
2654-158744-0010 LUCY WHO WAS A YEAR YOUNGER THAN LIZZIE HAD AT THAT TIME BEEN AN ORPHAN FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS SHE TOO HAD BEEN LEFT PENNILESS
2654-158744-0011 THE DEAN AND THE DEAN'S WIFE AND THE DEAN'S DAUGHTERS HAD BEEN HER BEST FRIENDS BUT THEY WERE NOT FRIENDS ON WHOM SHE COULD BE DEPENDENT THEY WERE IN NO WAY CONNECTED WITH HER BY BLOOD
2654-158744-0012 THEREFORE AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN SHE HAD GONE OUT TO BE A CHILD'S GOVERNESS THEN OLD LADY FAWN HAD HEARD OF HER VIRTUES LADY FAWN WHO HAD SEVEN UNMARRIED DAUGHTERS RUNNING DOWN FROM SEVEN AND TWENTY TO THIRTEEN
2654-158744-0013 AND LUCY MORRIS HAD BEEN HIRED TO TEACH ENGLISH FRENCH GERMAN AND SOMETHING OF MUSIC TO THE TWO YOUNGEST MISS FAWNS DURING THAT VISIT AT THE DEANERY WHEN THE HEIR OF THE EUSTACES WAS BEING BORN
2654-158744-0014 LUCY WAS UNDERGOING A SORT OF PROBATION FOR THE FAWN ESTABLISHMENT THE PROPOSED ENGAGEMENT WITH LADY FAWN WAS THOUGHT TO BE A GREAT THING FOR HER LADY FAWN WAS KNOWN AS A MIRACLE OF VIRTUE BENEVOLENCE AND PERSISTENCY
2654-158744-0015 EVERY GOOD QUALITY THAT SHE POSSESSED WAS SO MARKED AS TO BE WORTHY OF BEING EXPRESSED WITH A CAPITAL BUT HER VIRTUES
2654-158744-0016 NO GETTING OVER THEM NO PERVERTING THEM WITH FOLLIES OR EVEN EXAGGERATIONS WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE EXCELLENCIES OF MISS MORRIS FROM THE DEAN'S WIFE
2654-158744-0017 SHE EXPRESSED HERSELF WILLING TO TAKE LUCY INTO HER HOUSE ON SPECIAL CONDITIONS SHE MUST BE ABLE TO TEACH MUSIC UP TO A CERTAIN POINT THEN IT'S ALL OVER SAID LUCY TO THE DEAN WITH HER PRETTY SMILE
2654-158744-0018 THAT SMILE WHICH CAUSED ALL THE OLD AND MIDDLE AGED MEN TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER IT'S NOT OVER AT ALL SAID THE DEAN YOU'VE GOT FOUR MONTHS
2654-158744-0019 AND HE SHALL TEACH YOU SO LUCY WENT TO BOBSBOROUGH AND WAS AFTERWARDS ACCEPTED BY LADY FAWN WHILE SHE WAS AT THE DEANERY THERE SPRUNG UP A RENEWED FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN HER AND LIZZIE
2654-158744-0020 WHO WAS QUICK AND UNCONSCIOUSLY CAPABLE OF READING THAT BOOK TO WHICH WE ALLUDED IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER WAS SOMEWHAT AFRAID OF THE RICH WIDOW AND WHEN LIZZIE TALKED TO HER OF THEIR OLD CHILDISH DAYS AND QUOTED POETRY AND SPOKE OF THINGS ROMANTIC
2654-158744-0021 AS SHE WAS MUCH GIVEN TO DO LUCY FELT THAT THE METAL DID NOT RING TRUE AND THEN LIZZIE HAD AN UGLY HABIT OF ABUSING ALL HER OTHER FRIENDS BEHIND THEIR BACKS
2654-158744-0022 NOW LUCY DID NOT LIKE TO HEAR THE GREYSTOCKS ABUSED AND WOULD SAY SO THAT'S ALL VERY WELL YOU LITTLE MINX LIZZIE WOULD SAY PLAYFULLY
2654-158744-0023 THIS ONE WAS FRANK GREYSTOCK THE BARRISTER OF FRANK GREYSTOCK SOME SPECIAL BUT LET IT BE HOPED VERY SHORT DESCRIPTION MUST BE GIVEN BY AND BY FOR THE PRESENT IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO DECLARE THAT
2654-158744-0024 DURING THAT SHORT EASTER HOLIDAY WHICH HE SPENT AT HIS FATHER'S HOUSE IN BOBSBOROUGH HE FOUND LUCY MORRIS TO BE A MOST AGREEABLE COMPANION REMEMBER HER POSITION SAID MISSUS DEAN TO HER SON
2654-158744-0025 HER POSITION WELL AND WHAT IS HER POSITION MOTHER YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN FRANK SHE IS AS SWEET A GIRL AS EVER LIVED AND A PERFECT LADY BUT WITH A GOVERNESS UNLESS YOU MEAN TO MARRY HER
2654-158744-0026 YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL THAN WITH ANOTHER GIRL BECAUSE YOU MAY DO HER SUCH A WORLD OF MISCHIEF
2654-158744-0027 IF LADY FAWN KNEW THAT SHE HAD AN ADMIRER LADY FAWN WOULD NOT LET HER COME INTO HER HOUSE THEN LADY FAWN IS AN IDIOT
2654-158744-0028 OF COURSE SHE WILL BE ADMIRED WHO CAN HINDER IT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN FRANK YES I DO WELL I DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN AFFORD TO MARRY LUCY MORRIS AT ANY RATE MOTHER I WILL NEVER SAY A WORD TO RAISE A HOPE IN HER
2654-158744-0029 IF IT WOULD BE A HOPE OF COURSE IT WOULD BE A HOPE I DON'T KNOW THAT AT ALL BUT I WILL NEVER SAY ANY SUCH WORD TO HER
2654-158744-0030 OH FRANK IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE SAID MISSUS DEAN MISSUS DEAN WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN BUT
2654-158744-0031 OR AT LEAST ON BEHALF OF THIS SPECIAL CHILD AND SHE DID THINK IT WOULD BE VERY NICE IF FRANK WOULD MARRY AN HEIRESS THIS HOWEVER WAS A LONG TIME AGO NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO
2654-158744-0032 THE YOUNGEST FAWN GIRL WAS NOT YET FIFTEEN AND IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT LUCY WAS TO REMAIN WITH THE FAWNS FOR SOME QUITE INDEFINITE TIME TO COME
2654-158744-0033 AND IT WAS QUITE PROBABLE THAT LUCY MIGHT BE TRANSFERRED LADY FAWN FULLY APPRECIATED HER TREASURE AND WAS AND EVER HAD BEEN CONSCIENTIOUSLY ANXIOUS TO MAKE LUCY'S LIFE HAPPY
2654-158744-0034 BUT SHE THOUGHT THAT A GOVERNESS SHOULD NOT BE DESIROUS OF MARRYING AT ANY RATE TILL A SOMEWHAT ADVANCED PERIOD OF LIFE A GOVERNESS IF SHE WERE GIVEN TO FALLING IN LOVE COULD HARDLY PERFORM HER DUTIES IN LIFE NO DOUBT
2654-158744-0035 NOT TO BE A GOVERNESS BUT A YOUNG LADY FREE FROM THE EMBARRASSING NECESSITY OF EARNING BREAD FREE TO HAVE A LOVER AND A HUSBAND
2654-158744-0036 LADY FAWN COULD TALK EXCELLENT SENSE ON THIS SUBJECT BY THE HOUR AND ALWAYS ADMITTED THAT
2654-158744-0037 SHE WAS VERY FOND OF LUCY MORRIS AND TREATED HER DEPENDENT WITH AFFECTIONATE CONSIDERATION BUT SHE DID NOT APPROVE OF VISITS FROM MISTER FRANK GREYSTOCK LUCY BLUSHING UP TO THE EYES
2654-158744-0038 HAD ONCE DECLARED THAT SHE DESIRED TO HAVE NO PERSONAL VISITORS AT LADY FAWN'S HOUSE BUT THAT AS REGARDED HER OWN FRIENDSHIPS THE MATTER WAS ONE FOR HER OWN BOSOM
2654-158744-0039 LADY FAWN HAD SAID WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER SO PERFECTLY AND YOU ARE SO GOOD THAT I AM QUITE SURE EVERYTHING WILL BE AS IT OUGHT TO BE LADY FAWN LIVED DOWN AT RICHMOND ALL THE YEAR THROUGH
2654-158744-0040 IN A LARGE OLD FASHIONED HOUSE WITH A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GARDEN CALLED FAWN COURT AFTER THAT SPEECH OF HERS TO LUCY FRANK GREYSTOCK DID NOT CALL AGAIN AT FAWN COURT FOR MANY MONTHS
2654-158744-0041 BUT LADY EUSTACE WITH HER PRETTY LITTLE PAIR OF GREY PONIES WOULD SOMETIMES DRIVE DOWN TO RICHMOND TO SEE HER DEAR LITTLE OLD FRIEND LUCY AND HER VISITS WERE ALLOWED
2654-158744-0042 LADY FAWN HAD EXPRESSED AN OPINION AMONG HER DAUGHTERS THAT SHE DID NOT SEE ANY HARM IN LADY EUSTACE
2654-158744-0043 BUT THEN LADY FAWN HATED LADY LINLITHGOW AS ONLY TWO OLD WOMEN CAN HATE EACH OTHER AND SHE HAD NOT HEARD THE STORY OF THE DIAMOND NECKLACE LUCY MORRIS CERTAINLY WAS A TREASURE A TREASURE THOUGH NO HEROINE
2654-158744-0044 SHE WAS A SWEETLY SOCIAL GENIAL LITTLE HUMAN BEING WHOSE PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE WAS EVER FELT TO BE LIKE SUNSHINE SHE WAS NEVER FORWARD BUT NEVER BASHFUL SHE WAS ALWAYS OPEN TO FAMILIAR INTERCOURSE WITHOUT EVER PUTTING HERSELF FORWARD
2654-158744-0045 AND SHE COULD DO THE SAME WITH ANY CHILD SHE WAS AN ACTIVE MINDFUL BRIGHT ENERGETIC LITTLE THING TO WHOM NO WORK EVER CAME AMISS SHE HAD CATALOGUED THE LIBRARY
2654-158744-0046 SHE HAD PLANNED THE NEW FLOWER GARDEN
2654-158744-0047 WHEN THE GIRLS GOT UP CHARADES THEY HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EVERYTHING DEPENDED ON MISS MORRIS THEY WERE GOOD NATURED PLAIN UNATTRACTIVE GIRLS WHO SPOKE OF HER TO HER FACE AS ONE WHO COULD EASILY DO ANYTHING TO WHICH SHE MIGHT PUT HER HAND
2654-158744-0048 LADY FAWN DID REALLY LOVE HER LORD FAWN THE ELDEST SON A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT THIRTY FIVE A PEER OF PARLIAMENT AND AN UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE
2654-158744-0049 OF WHOM HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS STOOD IN GREAT AWE CONSULTED HER FREQUENTLY AND MADE NO SECRET OF HIS FRIENDSHIP THE MOTHER KNEW HER AWFUL SON WELL AND WAS AFRAID OF NOTHING WRONG IN THAT DIRECTION LORD FAWN HAD SUFFERED A DISAPPOINTMENT IN LOVE
2654-158744-0050 BUT HE HAD CONSOLED HIMSELF WITH BLUE BOOKS AND MASTERED HIS PASSION BY INCESSANT ATTENDANCE AT THE INDIA BOARD THE LADY HE HAD LOVED HAD BEEN RICH AND LORD FAWN WAS POOR BUT NEVERTHELESS HE HAD MASTERED HIS PASSION
2654-158744-0051 THERE WAS NO FEAR THAT HIS FEELINGS TOWARDS THE GOVERNESS WOULD BECOME TOO WARM NOR WAS IT LIKELY THAT MISS MORRIS SHOULD ENCOUNTER DANGER IN REGARD TO HIM IT WAS QUITE AN UNDERSTOOD THING IN THE FAMILY THAT LORD FAWN MUST MARRY MONEY
2654-158744-0052 LUCY MORRIS WAS INDEED A TREASURE NO BRIGHTER FACE EVER LOOKED INTO ANOTHER TO SEEK SYMPATHY THERE EITHER IN MIRTH OR WOE
2654-158744-0053 THOUGH IT WERE BUT FOR A MOMENT LORD FAWN WAS POMPOUS SLOW DULL AND CAREFUL BUT EVEN HE HAD GIVEN WAY TO IT AT ONCE
2654-158744-0054 OF COURSE LUCY WOULD BE MADE OVER TO THE HITTAWAYS WHOSE MOTHER LIVED IN WARWICK SQUARE AND WHOSE FATHER WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF CIVIL APPEALS THE HITTAWAYS WERE THE ONLY GRANDCHILDREN WITH WHOM LADY FAWN HAD AS YET BEEN BLESSED
2654-158744-0055 AND OF COURSE LUCY MUST GO TO THE HITTAWAYS SHE WAS BUT A LITTLE THING AND IT CANNOT BE SAID OF HER AS OF LADY EUSTACE THAT SHE WAS A BEAUTY THE CHARM OF HER FACE CONSISTED IN THE PECULIAR WATERY BRIGHTNESS OF HER EYES
2654-158744-0056 IN THE CORNERS OF WHICH IT WOULD ALWAYS SEEM THAT A DIAMOND OF A TEAR WAS LURKING WHENEVER ANY MATTER OF EXCITEMENT WAS AFOOT HER LIGHT BROWN HAIR WAS SOFT AND SMOOTH AND PRETTY AS HAIR IT WAS VERY WELL BUT IT HAD NO SPECIALITY
2654-158744-0057 HER MOUTH WAS SOMEWHAT LARGE BUT FULL OF EVER VARYING EXPRESSION HER FOREHEAD WAS LOW AND BROAD WITH PROMINENT TEMPLES ON WHICH IT WAS HER HABIT TO CLASP TIGHTLY HER LITTLE OUTSTRETCHED FINGERS AS SHE SAT LISTENING TO YOU
2654-158744-0058 OF LISTENERS SHE WAS THE VERY BEST FOR SHE WOULD ALWAYS BE SAYING A WORD OR TWO JUST TO HELP YOU
2654-158744-0059 THERE ARE LISTENERS WHO SHOW BY THEIR MODE OF LISTENING THAT THEY LISTEN AS A DUTY NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE INTERESTED LUCY MORRIS WAS NOT SUCH A ONE SHE WOULD TAKE UP YOUR SUBJECT WHATEVER IT WAS AND MAKE IT HER OWN
2654-158744-0060 THERE WAS FORWARD JUST THEN A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE SAWAB OF MYGAWB SHOULD HAVE TWENTY MILLIONS OF RUPEES PAID TO HIM AND BE PLACED UPON A THRONE OR WHETHER HE SHOULD BE KEPT IN PRISON ALL HIS LIFE
2654-158744-0061 THE BRITISH WORLD GENERALLY COULD NOT BE MADE TO INTEREST ITSELF ABOUT THE SAWAB BUT LUCY POSITIVELY MASTERED THE SUBJECT AND ALMOST GOT LORD FAWN INTO A DIFFICULTY BY PERSUADING HIM TO STAND UP AGAINST HIS CHIEF ON BEHALF OF THE INJURED PRINCE
2654-158744-0062 WHAT ELSE CAN BE SAID OF HER FACE OR PERSONAL APPEARANCE THAT WILL INTEREST A READER WHEN SHE SMILED
2654-158744-0063 AND WHEN SHE LAUGHED THAT LITTLE NOSE WHICH WAS NOT AS WELL SHAPED A NOSE AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WOULD ALMOST CHANGE ITS SHAPE AND COCK ITSELF UP IN ITS MIRTH HER HANDS WERE VERY THIN AND LONG AND SO WERE HER FEET
2654-158744-0064 BY NO MEANS MODELS AS WERE THOSE OF HER FRIEND LADY EUSTACE SHE WAS A LITTLE THIN QUICK GRACEFUL CREATURE WHOM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD SEE WITHOUT WISHING TO HAVE NEAR YOU A MOST UNSELFISH LITTLE CREATURE SHE WAS BUT ONE
2654-158744-0065 WHO HAD A WELL FORMED IDEA OF HER OWN IDENTITY SHE WAS QUITE RESOLVED TO BE SOMEBODY AMONG HER FELLOW CREATURES NOT SOMEBODY IN THE WAY OF MARRYING A LORD OR A RICH MAN OR SOMEBODY IN THE WAY OF BEING A BEAUTY OR SOMEBODY AS A WIT BUT
2654-158744-0066 SOMEBODY AS HAVING A PURPOSE AND A USE IN LIFE SHE WAS THE HUMBLEST LITTLE THING IN THE WORLD IN REGARD TO ANY POSSIBLE PUTTING OF HERSELF FORWARD OR NEEDFUL PUTTING OF HERSELF BACK AND YET TO HERSELF NOBODY WAS HER SUPERIOR
2654-158744-0067 OR THE WIT WHICH NATURE HAD GIVEN HER
2654-158744-0068 SHE COVETED NO MAN'S POSSESSIONS AND NO WOMAN'S BUT SHE WAS MINDED TO HOLD BY HER OWN OF PRESENT ADVANTAGES OR DISADVANTAGES WHETHER SHE HAD THE ONE OR SUFFERED FROM THE OTHER SHE THOUGHT NOT AT ALL
2654-158744-0069 IT WAS HER FAULT THAT SHE HAD NOTHING OF FEMININE VANITY BUT
2654-158744-0070 TO PERSUADE TO OBTAIN BELIEF SYMPATHY AND CO OPERATION NOT FOR ANY RESULT PERSONAL TO HERSELF BUT BECAUSE BY OBTAINING THESE THINGS SHE COULD BE EFFECTIVE IN THE OBJECT THEN BEFORE HER BE IT WHAT IT MIGHT
2654-158744-0071 ONE OTHER THING MAY BE TOLD OF HER SHE HAD GIVEN HER HEART FOR GOOD AND ALL AS SHE OWNED TO HERSELF TO FRANK GREYSTOCK SHE HAD OWNED TO HERSELF THAT IT WAS SO AND HAD OWNED TO HERSELF THAT NOTHING COULD COME OF IT
2654-158744-0072 FRANK WAS BECOMING A MAN OF MARK BUT WAS BECOMING A MAN OF MARK WITHOUT MUCH MONEY OF ALL MEN HE WAS THE LAST WHO COULD AFFORD TO MARRY A GOVERNESS AND THEN MOREOVER HE HAD NEVER SAID A WORD TO MAKE HER THINK THAT HE LOVED HER
2654-158744-0073 LADY FAWN HOWEVER HAD NOT COMPLAINED BUT JUST SAID A WORD A WORD IN SEASON HOW GOOD IS IT LUCY DID NOT MUCH REGARD THE WORD SPOKEN TO HERSELF
2654-158744-0074 OTHERWISE HOW SHOULD IT HAVE BEEN THAT HE NEVER CAME AGAIN THAT SHE DID NOT LIKE IN HERSELF SHE REGARDED THIS PASSION OF HERS AS A HEALTHY MAN REGARDS THE LOSS OF A LEG OR AN ARM
2654-158744-0075 IT IS A GREAT NUISANCE A LOSS THAT MAIMS THE WHOLE LIFE A MISFORTUNE TO BE MUCH REGRETTED BUT BECAUSE A LEG IS GONE EVERYTHING IS NOT GONE A MAN WITH A WOODEN LEG MAY STUMP ABOUT THROUGH MUCH ACTION AND MAY ENJOY THE KEENEST PLEASURES OF HUMANITY
2654-158744-0076 HE HAS HIS EYES LEFT TO HIM AND HIS EARS AND HIS INTELLECT HE WILL NOT BREAK HIS HEART FOR THE LOSS OF THAT LEG AND SO IT WAS WITH LUCY MORRIS SHE WOULD STILL STUMP ABOUT AND BE VERY ACTIVE
2654-158744-0077 EYES EARS AND INTELLECT WERE LEFT TO HER LOOKING AT HER POSITION SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT A HAPPY LOVE COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN HER LOT IN LIFE LADY FAWN SHE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT A GOVERNESS SHOULD MAKE UP HER MIND TO DO WITHOUT A LOVER
2654-158744-0078 WHEN ON ONE DULL DARK AFTERNOON AS SHE WAS THINKING OF ALL THIS
2654-158744-0079 SHE WENT TO WORK UPON IT IMMEDIATELY AS SHE READ IT
2654-158744-0081 AND DURING SIX MONTHS FRANK GREYSTOCK HAD NOT BEEN AT FAWN COURT THEN ONE DAY
2654-158744-0082 MISS MACNULTY WHILE MISS MACNULTY WAS BEING HONOURED BY LADY FAWN
2654-158744-0083 HAVE YOU SEEN FRANK LATELY SAID LADY EUSTACE REFERRING TO HER COUSIN THE BARRISTER NOT FOR EVER SO LONG SAID LUCY WITH HER CHEERIEST SMILE HE IS NOT GOING TO PROVE A FALSE KNIGHT
2654-158744-0084 ASKED LADY EUSTACE IN HER LOWEST WHISPER I DON'T KNOW THAT MISTER GREYSTOCK IS MUCH GIVEN TO KNIGHTHOOD AT ALL SAID LUCY UNLESS IT IS TO BEING MADE SIR FRANCIS BY HIS PARTY NONSENSE MY DEAR AS IF I DIDN'T KNOW
2654-158744-0085 SHE IS NOT AN OLD CAT LIZZIE AND I WON'T HEAR HER CALLED SO
2654-158744-0086 THEN SHE HAS INTERFERED SAID LADY EUSTACE
2673-156474-0000 BATTLE OF THE IRONCLADS FLAG OFFICER FARRAGUT FORTS JACKSON AND SAINT PHILIP NEW ORLEANS CAPTURED
2673-156474-0001 FARRAGUT AT VICKSBURG FARRAGUT'S SECOND EXPEDITION TO VICKSBURG RETURN TO NEW ORLEANS IN ADDITION TO ITS HEAVY WORK OF MAINTAINING THE ATLANTIC BLOCKADE
2673-156474-0002 EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO AFTER CAREFUL PREPARATION DURING SEVERAL MONTHS A JOINT EXPEDITION UNDER THE COMMAND OF GENERAL AMBROSE E BURNSIDE AND FLAG OFFICER GOLDSBOROUGH
2673-156474-0003 BEFORE THE LARGER VESSELS COULD EFFECT THEIR ENTRANCE THROUGH HATTERAS INLET CAPTURED IN THE PREVIOUS AUGUST A FURIOUS STORM SET IN WHICH DELAYED THE EXPEDITION NEARLY A MONTH BY FEBRUARY SEVENTH HOWEVER
2673-156474-0004 THAT AND OTHER SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES WERE OVERCOME AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE EXPEDITION CAPTURED ROANOKE ISLAND AND THUS COMPLETELY OPENED THE WHOLE INTERIOR WATER SYSTEM OF ALBEMARLE AND PAMLICO SOUNDS
2673-156474-0005 AND THE REDUCTION OF FORT MACON AND THE REBEL DEFENSES OF ELIZABETH CITY NEW BERNE AND OTHER SMALLER PLACES AN EVENTUAL ADVANCE UPON GOLDSBORO FORMED PART OF THE ORIGINAL PLAN
2673-156474-0006 BUT BEFORE IT COULD BE EXECUTED CIRCUMSTANCES INTERVENED EFFECTUALLY TO THWART THAT OBJECT WHILE THE GRADUAL OCCUPATION OF THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST WAS GOING ON TWO OTHER EXPEDITIONS OF A SIMILAR NATURE WERE MAKING STEADY PROGRESS
2673-156474-0007 ONE OF THEM UNDER THE DIRECTION OF GENERAL QUINCY A GILLMORE CARRIED ON A REMARKABLE SIEGE OPERATION AGAINST FORT PULASKI STANDING ON AN ISOLATED SEA MARSH AT THE MOUTH OF THE SAVANNAH RIVER
2673-156474-0008 HERE NOT ONLY THE DIFFICULTIES OF APPROACH BUT THE APPARENTLY INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE OF MAKING THE SOFT UNCTUOUS MUD SUSTAIN HEAVY BATTERIES WAS OVERCOME AND THE FORT COMPELLED TO SURRENDER ON APRIL ELEVENTH
2673-156474-0009 AFTER AN EFFECTIVE BOMBARDMENT THE SECOND WAS AN EXPEDITION OF NINETEEN SHIPS WHICH WITHIN A FEW DAYS DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH WITHOUT SERIOUS RESISTANCE
2673-156474-0010 THE DESTRUCTION AT THAT TIME ATTEMPTED BY COMMODORE PAULDING REMAINED VERY INCOMPLETE AMONG THE VESSELS SET ON FIRE THE SCREW FRIGATE MERRIMAC WHICH HAD BEEN SCUTTLED
2673-156474-0011 WAS BURNED ONLY TO THE WATER'S EDGE LEAVING HER HULL AND MACHINERY ENTIRELY UNINJURED IN DUE TIME SHE WAS RAISED BY THE CONFEDERATES COVERED WITH A SLOPING ROOF OF RAILROAD IRON
2673-156474-0012 PROVIDED WITH A HUGE WEDGE SHAPED PROW OF CAST IRON AND ARMED WITH A FORMIDABLE BATTERY OF TEN GUNS SECRET INFORMATION CAME TO THE NAVY DEPARTMENT OF THE PROGRESS OF THIS WORK
2673-156474-0013 IN SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THE PARTICULAR ONE OF THESE THREE ESPECIALLY INTENDED FOR THIS PECULIAR EMERGENCY WAS A SHIP OF ENTIRELY NOVEL DESIGN MADE BY THE CELEBRATED INVENTOR JOHN ERICSSON
2673-156474-0014 A SWEDE BY BIRTH BUT AMERICAN BY ADOPTION A MAN WHO COMBINED GREAT ORIGINAL GENIUS WITH LONG SCIENTIFIC STUDY AND EXPERIENCE HIS INVENTION MAY BE MOST QUICKLY DESCRIBED AS HAVING A SMALL VERY LOW HULL
2673-156474-0015 COVERED BY A MUCH LONGER AND WIDER FLAT DECK ONLY A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE WATER LINE UPON WHICH WAS PLACED A REVOLVING IRON TURRET TWENTY FEET IN DIAMETER NINE FEET HIGH AND EIGHT INCHES THICK
2673-156474-0016 ON THE INSIDE OF WHICH WERE TWO ELEVEN INCH GUNS TRAINED SIDE BY SIDE AND REVOLVING WITH THE TURRET THIS UNIQUE NAVAL STRUCTURE WAS PROMPTLY NICKNAMED A CHEESE BOX ON A RAFT
2673-156474-0017 AND THE DESIGNATION WAS NOT AT ALL INAPT NAVAL EXPERTS AT ONCE RECOGNIZED THAT HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE BAD BUT COMPENSATION WAS THOUGHT TO EXIST IN THE BELIEF THAT HER IRON TURRET WOULD RESIST SHOT AND SHELL
2673-156474-0018 AND IT QUICKLY BECAME CERTAIN THAT THIS WAS THE MUCH TALKED OF REBEL IRONCLAD MERRIMAC OR AS THE CONFEDERATES HAD RENAMED HER THE VIRGINIA SHE STEAMED RAPIDLY TOWARD NEWPORT NEWS THREE MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST
2673-156474-0019 WHERE THE UNION SHIPS CONGRESS AND CUMBERLAND LAY AT ANCHOR THESE SAW THE UNCOUTH MONSTER COMING AND PREPARED FOR ACTION THE MINNESOTA THE SAINT LAWRENCE AND THE ROANOKE LYING AT FORTRESS MONROE ALSO SAW HER
2673-156474-0020 NEITHER DID THE BROADSIDES OF HER INTENDED PREY NOR THE FIRE OF THE SHORE BATTERIES FOR EVEN AN INSTANT ARREST HER SPEED AS RUSHING ON SHE STRUCK THE CUMBERLAND
2673-156474-0021 AND WITH HER IRON PROW BROKE A HOLE AS LARGE AS A HOGSHEAD IN HER SIDE THEN BACKING AWAY AND HOVERING OVER HER VICTIM AT CONVENIENT DISTANCE SHE RAKED HER DECKS WITH SHOT AND SHELL UNTIL AFTER THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR'S COMBAT
2673-156474-0022 WHO HAD MAINTAINED THE FIGHT WITH UNYIELDING STUBBORNNESS WENT TO THE BOTTOM IN FIFTY FEET OF WATER WITH COLORS FLYING HAVING SUNK THE CUMBERLAND
2673-156474-0023 THE MERRIMAC NEXT TURNED HER ATTENTION TO THE CONGRESS WHICH HAD MEANWHILE RUN INTO SHOAL WATER AND GROUNDED WHERE THE REBEL VESSEL COULD NOT FOLLOW BUT THE MERRIMAC BEING HERSELF APPARENTLY PROOF AGAINST SHOT AND SHELL BY HER IRON PLATING
2673-156474-0024 TOOK UP A RAKING POSITION TWO CABLES LENGTH AWAY AND DURING AN HOUR'S FIRING DELIBERATELY REDUCED THE CONGRESS TO HELPLESSNESS AND TO SURRENDER HER COMMANDER BEING KILLED AND THE VESSEL SET ON FIRE
2673-156474-0025 THE APPROACH THE MANOEUVERING AND THE TWO SUCCESSIVE COMBATS CONSUMED THE AFTERNOON AND TOWARD NIGHTFALL THE MERRIMAC AND HER THREE SMALL CONSORTS THAT HAD TAKEN LITTLE PART IN THE ACTION WITHDREW TO THE REBEL BATTERIES ON THE VIRGINIA SHORE
2673-156474-0026 THAT SAME NIGHT WHILE THE BURNING CONGRESS YET LIGHTED UP THE WATERS OF HAMPTON ROADS A LITTLE SHIP AS STRANGE LOOKING AND AS NEW TO MARINE WARFARE AS THE REBEL TURTLEBACK HERSELF ARRIVED BY SEA IN TOW FROM NEW YORK
2673-156474-0027 AND RECEIVING ORDERS TO PROCEED AT ONCE TO THE SCENE OF CONFLICT STATIONED HERSELF NEAR THE GROUNDED MINNESOTA THIS WAS ERICSSON'S CHEESE BOX ON A RAFT NAMED BY HIM THE MONITOR
2673-156474-0028 THE UNION OFFICERS WHO HAD WITNESSED THE DAY'S EVENTS WITH DISMAY AND WERE FILLED WITH GLOOMY FOREBODINGS FOR THE MORROW WHILE WELCOMING THIS PROVIDENTIAL REINFORCEMENT WERE BY NO MEANS REASSURED
2673-156474-0029 THE MONITOR WAS ONLY HALF THE SIZE OF HER ANTAGONIST AND HAD ONLY TWO GUNS TO THE OTHER'S TEN BUT THIS VERY DISPARITY PROVED AN ESSENTIAL ADVANTAGE WITH ONLY TEN FEET DRAFT TO THE MERRIMAC'S TWENTY TWO
2673-156474-0030 LIEUTENANT JOHN L WORDEN COMMANDING THE MONITOR STEAMED BOLDLY OUT TO MEET HER THEN ENSUED A THREE HOURS NAVAL CONFLICT WHICH HELD THE BREATHLESS ATTENTION OF THE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS AND THE SPECTATORS ON SHIP AND SHORE
2673-156474-0031 AND FOR MANY WEEKS EXCITED THE WONDERMENT OF THE READING WORLD IF THE MONITOR'S SOLID ELEVEN INCH BALLS BOUNDED WITHOUT APPARENT EFFECT FROM THE SLOPING ROOF OF THE MERRIMAC SO IN TURN
2673-156474-0032 THE MERRIMAC'S BROADSIDES PASSED HARMLESSLY OVER THE LOW DECK OF THE MONITOR OR REBOUNDED FROM THE ROUND SIDES OF HER IRON TURRET
2673-156474-0033 TRIED TO RAM THE POINTED RAFT THAT CARRIED THE CHEESE BOX
2673-156474-0034 EASILY GLIDED OUT OF THE LINE OF DIRECT IMPACT EACH SHIP PASSED THROUGH OCCASIONAL MOMENTS OF DANGER BUT THE LONG THREE HOURS ENCOUNTER ENDED WITHOUT OTHER SERIOUS DAMAGE THAN AN INJURY TO LIEUTENANT WORDEN
2673-156474-0035 BY THE EXPLOSION OF A REBEL SHELL AGAINST A CREVICE OF THE MONITOR'S PILOT HOUSE THROUGH WHICH HE WAS LOOKING WHICH TEMPORARILY BLINDING HIS EYE SIGHT DISABLED HIM FROM COMMAND AT THAT POINT THE BATTLE ENDED BY MUTUAL CONSENT THE MONITOR
2673-156474-0036 RAN INTO SHOAL WATER TO PERMIT SURGICAL ATTENDANCE TO HER WOUNDED OFFICER
2673-162129-0000 YET THAT IN DEMOCRACY ITSELF THERE IS NO INHERENT OPPOSITION TO LIBERTY THE DANGER TO INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY IN A DEMOCRACY
2673-162129-0001 IT IS EQUALLY POSSIBLE FOR THE GOVERNING POWER ON THE ONE HAND TO RESPECT OR ON THE OTHER HAND TO IGNORE THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS TO THE FREE PLAY OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL POWERS THE EXERCISE OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL PREDILECTIONS
2673-162129-0002 THE LEADING OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL LIVES ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN NOTIONS OF WHAT IS RIGHT OR DESIRABLE A MONARCH OF ENLIGHTENED AND LIBERAL MIND WILL RESPECT THAT RIGHT
2673-162129-0003 AND LIMIT HIS ENCROACHMENTS UPON IT TO THE MINIMUM REQUIRED FOR THE ESSENTIAL OBJECTS OF REASONABLE GOVERNMENT SO TOO WILL A DEMOCRACY IF IT IS OF LIKE TEMPER AND INTELLIGENCE BUT IT IS NOT SO WITH SOCIALISM
2673-162129-0004 NUMEROUS AS ARE THE VARIETIES OF SOCIALISM THEY ALL AGREE IN BEING INHERENTLY ANTAGONISTIC TO INDIVIDUALISM IT MAY BE PLEADED IN CRITICISM OF THIS ASSERTION
2673-162129-0005 THAT ALL GOVERNMENT IS OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUALISM THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS RESPECT BETWEEN SOCIALISM AND OTHER FORMS OF CIVIL ORGANIZATION IS ONLY ONE OF DEGREE THAT WE MAKE A SURRENDER OF INDIVIDUALITY
2673-162129-0006 AS WELL AS OF LIBERTY WHEN WE CONSENT TO LIVE IN ANY ORGANIZED FORM OF SOCIETY IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO DISPUTE THE POINT THE DIFFERENCE MAY IF ONE CHOOSES BE REGARDED AS ONLY A DIFFERENCE OF DEGREE
2673-162129-0007 EQUIVALENT TO A DIFFERENCE OF KIND SOCIALISM IS IN ITS VERY ESSENCE OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUALISM IT MAKES THE COLLECTIVE WELFARE NOT AN INCIDENTAL CONCERN OF EACH MAN'S DAILY LIFE
2673-162129-0008 BUT HIS PRIMARY CONCERN THE STANDARD IT SETS UP THE REGULATIONS IT ESTABLISHES ARE NOT THINGS THAT A MAN MUST MERELY TAKE ACCOUNT OF AS SPECIAL RESTRAINTS ON HIS FREEDOM
2673-162129-0009 EXCEPTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON THE EXERCISE OF HIS INDIVIDUALITY THEY CONSTITUTE THE BASIC CONDITIONS OF HIS LIFE WHEN THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT WAS IN ITS INFANCY IN THIS COUNTRY
2673-162129-0010 THOUGH IT HAD MADE GREAT HEADWAY IN SEVERAL OF THE LEADING COUNTRIES OF EUROPE THE CUSTOMARY WAY OF DISPOSING OF IT WAS WITH A MERE WAVE OF THE HAND SOCIALISM CAN NEVER WORK IT IS CONTRARY TO HUMAN NATURE
2673-162129-0011 YET I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT A VERY LARGE PROPORTION OF THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO SOCIALISM ARE STILL CONTENT WITH THIS WAY OF DISPOSING OF IT BUT SOCIALISM HAS STEADILY THOUGH OF COURSE WITH FLUCTUATIONS
2673-162129-0013 MILLIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN HERE IN AMERICA RANGING IN INTELLECT ALL THE WAY FROM THE MOST CULTURED TO THE MOST IGNORANT ARE FILLED WITH AN ARDENT FAITH THAT IN SOCIALISM AND IN NOTHING ELSE
2673-162129-0014 IS TO BE FOUND THE REMEDY FOR ALL THE GREAT EVILS UNDER WHICH MANKIND SUFFERS AND THERE IS NO SIGN OF SLACKENING IN THE GROWTH OF THIS FAITH WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR A REAL TEST OF ITS STRENGTH
2673-162129-0015 IT IS ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THAT THOSE WHO ARE INCLINED TO WELCOME IT AS THE SALVATION OF THE WORLD WILL BE FRIGHTENED OFF BY PROPHECIES OF FAILURE THEY WILL WANT TO MAKE THE TRIAL
2673-162129-0016 AND THEY WILL MAKE THE TRIAL REGARDLESS OF ALL PROPHECIES OF DISASTER IF THE PEOPLE SHALL HAVE COME TO BELIEVE THAT THE OBJECT IS A DESIRABLE ONE THAT SOCIALISM IS A FORM OF LIFE WHICH THEY WOULD LIKE AFTER THEY GOT IT
2673-162129-0017 THE ONE GREAT BULWARK AGAINST SOCIALISM IS THE SENTIMENT OF LIBERTY IF WE FIND NOTHING OBNOXIOUS IN UNIVERSAL REGIMENTATION
2673-162129-0018 IF WE FEEL THAT LIFE WOULD HAVE AS MUCH SAVOR WHEN ALL OF US WERE TOLD OFF TO OUR TASKS OR AT LEAST CIRCUMSCRIBED AND SUPERVISED IN OUR ACTIVITIES BY A SWARM OF OFFICIALS CARRYING OUT THE BENEVOLENT EDICTS OF A PATERNAL GOVERNMENT
2673-162129-0019 IF WE HOLD AS OF NO ACCOUNT THE EXERCISE OF INDIVIDUAL CHOICE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDIVIDUAL POTENTIALITIES WHICH ARE THE VERY LIFEBLOOD OF THE EXISTING ORDER OF SOCIETY IF ALL THESE THINGS HOLD NO VALUE FOR US
2673-162129-0020 THEN WE SHALL GRAVITATE TO SOCIALISM AS SURELY AS A RIVER WILL FIND ITS WAY TO THE SEA SOCIALISM GRANTED ITS PRACTICABILITY AND ITS PRACTICABILITY CAN NEVER BE DISPROVED EXCEPT BY TRIAL
2673-162129-0021 BY LONG AND REPEATED TRIAL HOLDS OUT THE PROMISE OF GREAT BLESSINGS TO MANKIND AND SOME OF THESE BLESSINGS IT IS ACTUALLY CAPABLE OF FURNISHING EVEN IF IN THE END IT SHOULD PROVE TO BE A FAILURE
2673-162129-0022 ABOVE ALL IT COULD COMPLETELY ABOLISH POVERTY THAT IS ANYTHING LIKE ABJECT POVERTY THE PRODUCTIVE POWER OF MANKIND THANKS TO THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE AND INVENTION
2673-162129-0023 IS NOW SO GREAT THAT EVEN IF SOCIALISM WERE TO BRING ABOUT A VERY GREAT DECLINE OF PRODUCTIVENESS NOT TO BE SURE SUCH UTTER BLASTING OF PRODUCTIVENESS AS HAS BEEN CAUSED BY THE BOLSHEVIK INSANITY
2673-162129-0024 BY EQUAL DISTRIBUTION THE SIMPLE NEEDS OF ALL THE PEOPLE BESIDES THE ABOLITION OF POVERTY THERE WOULD BE THE EXTINCTION OF MANY SINISTER FORMS OF COMPETITIVE GREED AND DISHONESTY TO THE EYE OF THE THINKING CONSERVATIVE
2673-162129-0025 THESE THINGS POVERTY GREED DISHONESTY WHILE SERIOUS EVILS ARE BUT THE BLEMISHES IN A GREAT AND WHOLESOME SCHEME OF HUMAN LIFE DRAWBACKS WHICH GO WITH THE BENEFITS OF A SYSTEM IN WHICH EACH MAN IS FREE
2673-162129-0026 THE MATTER PRESENTS ITSELF IN NO SUCH LIGHT HE SEES A MASS OF MISERY WHICH HE BELIEVES AND IN LARGE MEASURE JUSTLY BELIEVES SOCIALISM WOULD PUT AN END TO AND HE HAS NO PATIENCE WITH THE CONSERVATIVE WHO POINTS OUT
2673-162129-0027 AND AWAY WITH IT WE OUGHT ALL TO SAY IF SOCIALISM WHILE DOING AWAY WITH IT WOULD NOT BE DOING AWAY WITH SOMETHING ELSE OF INFINITE VALUE AND INFINITE BENEFIT TO MANKIND BOTH MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL
2673-162129-0028 SOMETHING WITH WHICH IS BOUND UP THE RICHNESS AND ZEST OF LIFE NOT ONLY FOR WHAT IT IS THE FASHION OF RADICALS TO CALL THE PRIVILEGED FEW BUT FOR THE GREAT MASS OF MANKIND THAT SOMETHING IS LIBERTY
2673-162129-0029 AND THE INDIVIDUALITY WHICH IS INSEPARABLY BOUND UP WITH LIBERTY THE ESSENCE OF SOCIALISM IS THE SUPPRESSION OF INDIVIDUALITY THE EXALTATION OF THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND THE COLLECTIVE INTEREST
2673-162129-0030 THE SUBMERGENCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL WILL AND THE INDIVIDUAL INTEREST THE PARTICULAR FORM EVEN THE PARTICULAR DEGREE OF COERCION BY WHICH THIS SUBMERGENCE IS BROUGHT ABOUT
2673-162129-0031 VARIES WITH THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOCIALISM BUT THEY ALL AGREE IN THE ESSENTIAL FACT OF THE SUBMERGENCE SOCIALISM MAY POSSIBLY BE COMPATIBLE WITH PROSPERITY WITH CONTENTMENT IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH LIBERTY
2673-162129-0032 NOT COMPATIBLE WITH INDIVIDUALITY I AM OF COURSE NOT UNDERTAKING HERE TO DISCUSS THE MERITS OF SOCIALISM MY PURPOSE IS ONLY TO POINT OUT THAT THOSE WHO ARE HOSTILE TO SOCIALISM MUST CHERISH LIBERTY
2673-162129-0033 AND IT IS VAIN TO CHERISH LIBERTY IN THE ABSTRACT IF YOU ARE DOING YOUR BEST TO DRY UP THE VERY SOURCE OF THE LOVE OF LIBERTY IN THE CONCRETE WORKINGS OF EVERY MAN'S DAILY EXPERIENCE WITH THE PLAIN MAN INDEED WITH MEN IN GENERAL
2673-162129-0034 PLAIN OR OTHERWISE LOVE OF LIBERTY OR OF ANY ELEMENTAL CONCEPT IS STRONG ONLY IF IT IS INSTINCTIVE
2673-162129-0035 AND IT CANNOT BE INSTINCTIVE IF IT IS JARRED EVERY DAY BY HABITUAL AND UNRESENTED EXPERIENCE OF ITS OPPOSITE PROHIBITION IS A RESTRAINT OF LIBERTY SO CLEARLY UNRELATED TO ANY PRIMARY NEED OF THE STATE
2673-162129-0036 WHICH CAN CLAIM THE JUSTIFICATION OF BEING INTENDED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE POOR OR UNFORTUNATE SO LONG AS PROHIBITION WAS A LOCAL MEASURE SO LONG EVEN AS IT WAS A MEASURE OF STATE LEGISLATION
2673-162129-0037 THIS EFFECT DID NOT FOLLOW OR IF AT ALL ONLY IN A SMALL DEGREE PEOPLE DID NOT REGARD IT AS A DOMINANT AND ABOVE ALL AS A PARAMOUNT AND INESCAPABLE PART OF THE NATIONAL LIFE BUT DECREED FOR THE WHOLE NATION
2673-162129-0038 AND IMBEDDED PERMANENTLY IN THE CONSTITUTION IT WILL HAVE AN IMMEASURABLE EFFECT IN IMPAIRING THAT INSTINCT OF LIBERTY WHICH HAS BEEN THE VERY HEART OF THE AMERICAN SPIRIT
2673-162129-0039 AND WITH THE LOSS OF THAT SPIRIT WILL BE LOST THE ONE GREAT AND ENDURING DEFENSE AGAINST SOCIALISM IT IS NOT BY THE ARGUMENTATION OF ECONOMISTS NOR BY THE CALCULATIONS OF STATISTICIANS THAT THE SOCIALIST ADVANCE CAN BE HALTED
2673-162129-0040 THE REAL STRUGGLE WILL BE A STRUGGLE NOT OF THE MIND BUT OF THE SPIRIT IT WILL BE SOCIALISM AND REGIMENTATION AGAINST INDIVIDUALISM AND LIBERTY THE CAUSE OF PROHIBITION HAS OWED ITS RAPID SUCCESS IN NO SMALL MEASURE
2673-162129-0041 TO THE SUPPORT OF GREAT CAPITALISTS AND INDUSTRIALISTS BENT UPON THE ABSORBING OBJECT OF PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY BUT THEY HAVE PAID A PRICE THEY LITTLE REALIZE FOR IN THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS MINOR OBJECT
2673-162129-0042 THEY HAVE MADE A TREMENDOUS BREACH IN THE GREATEST DEFENSE OF THE EXISTING ORDER OF SOCIETY AGAINST THE ADVANCING ENEMY TO UNDERMINE THE FOUNDATIONS OF LIBERTY
2673-162130-0000 IS THERE ANY WAY OUT IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THIS BOOK I UNDERTOOK TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE STATE OF MIND WHICH THE ENACTMENT OF THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT HAS CREATED
2673-162130-0001 AND WHICH IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT CONTEMPT FOR THE LAW WHOSE WIDESPREAD PREVALENCE AMONG THE BEST ELEMENTS OF OUR POPULATION IS ACKNOWLEDGED ALIKE BY PROHIBITIONISTS AND ANTI PROHIBITIONISTS
2673-162130-0002 PEOPLE FEEL IN THEIR HEARTS I SAID THAT THEY ARE CONFRONTED WITH NO OTHER CHOICE BUT THAT OF EITHER SUBMITTING TO THE FULL RIGOR OF PROHIBITION OF TRYING TO PROCURE A LAW WHICH NULLIFIES THE CONSTITUTION
2673-162130-0003 OR OF EXPRESSING THEIR RESENTMENT AGAINST AN OUTRAGE ON THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION BY CONTEMPTUOUS DISREGARD OF THE LAW IT IS A DEPLORABLE CHOICE OF EVILS
2673-162130-0004 MUST ASK WHETHER THERE IS ANY PRACTICAL POSSIBILITY OF ESCAPE FROM IT THE RIGHT MEANS AND THE ONLY ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM IT IS THROUGH THE UNDOING OF THE ERROR WHICH BROUGHT IT ABOUT
2673-162130-0005 THAT IS THROUGH THE REPEAL OF THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT TOWARDS THAT END MANY EARNEST AND PATRIOTIC CITIZENS ARE WORKING BUT OF COURSE THEY REALIZE THE STUPENDOUS DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK THEY HAVE UNDERTAKEN
2673-162130-0006 AS A RULE THESE MEN WHILE WORKING FOR THE DISTANT GOAL OF REPEAL OF THE AMENDMENT ARE SEEKING TO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE VOLSTEAD ACT A LAW WHICH WILL PERMIT THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF BEER AND LIGHT WINES
2673-162130-0007 BUT IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO CONTEMPLATE A SITUATION IN WHICH TO AVOID SOMETHING STILL WORSE
2673-162130-0008 THAT AMENDMENT IMBEDS PROHIBITION IN THE ORGANIC LAW OF THE COUNTRY AND THUS NOT ONLY IMPOSES IT UPON THE INDIVIDUAL STATES REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEIR DESIRES MAY BE
2673-162130-0009 NOW AN AMENDMENT REPEALING THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME CONFERRING UPON CONGRESS THE POWER TO MAKE LAWS CONCERNING THE MANUFACTURE SALE AND TRANSPORTATION OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS
2673-162130-0010 AN INCOMPARABLY MORE FAVORABLE RECEPTION FROM THE START THAN WOULD A PROPOSAL OF SIMPLE REPEAL FOR THE PUBLIC COULD READILY BE BROUGHT TO SEE THE REASONABLENESS OF GIVING THE NATION A CHANCE THROUGH ITS REPRESENTATIVES AT WASHINGTON
2673-162130-0011 TO EXPRESS ITS WILL ON THE SUBJECT FROM TIME TO TIME AND THE UNREASONABLENESS OF BINDING GENERATION AFTER GENERATION TO HELPLESS SUBMISSION
2673-162130-0012 AND IT IS RARELY THAT THAT PLEA RESTS ON STRONGER GROUND THAN IT WOULD IN THIS INSTANCE THE ONE STRONG ARGUMENT WHICH MIGHT BE URGED AGAINST THE PROPOSAL NAMELY THAT SUCH A PROVISION WOULD MAKE PROHIBITION A CONSTANT ISSUE IN NATIONAL ELECTIONS
2673-162130-0013 THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT HAS BEEN A FRIGHTFUL BREEDER OF UNSETTLEMENT AND CONTENTION WHICH BIDS FAIR TO CONTINUE INDEFINITELY I HAVE OFFERED THIS SUGGESTION FOR WHAT IT MAY BE WORTH AS A PRACTICAL PROPOSAL
2673-162130-0014 IT SEEMS CERTAINLY DESERVING OF DISCUSSION AND I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM PUTTING IT FORWARD AS A POSSIBLE MEANS OF RELIEF FROM AN INTOLERABLE SITUATION BUT I DO NOT WISH TO WIND UP ON THAT NOTE THE RIGHT SOLUTION
2673-162130-0015 A SOLUTION INCOMPARABLY BETTER THAN THIS WHICH I HAVE SUGGESTED ON ACCOUNT OF ITS APPARENTLY BETTER CHANCE OF ACCEPTANCE IS THE OUTRIGHT REPEAL OF THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT AND MOREOVER
2673-162130-0016 THE PRIMARY NEED OF THIS MOMENT IS NOT SO MUCH ANY PRACTICAL PROPOSAL LIKELY TO BE QUICKLY REALIZED AS THE AWAKENING OF THE PUBLIC MIND TO THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES OF THE CASE THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW OF GOVERNMENT
2673-162130-0017 AND OF INDIVIDUAL LIFE WHICH ARE SO FLAGRANTLY SINNED AGAINST BY THE PROHIBITION AMENDMENT TO THE EXPOSITION OF THOSE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THIS LITTLE BOOK HAS BEEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY CONFINED
2673-162130-0018 WHAT IS NEEDED ABOVE ALL IS A CLEAR AND WHOLEHEARTED RECOGNITION OF FUNDAMENTALS AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE GOT SO FAR AWAY FROM THEIR FUNDAMENTALS THAT SUCH RECOGNITION WILL BE DENIED WHEN THE CASE IS CLEARLY PUT BEFORE THEM
2673-162130-0019 THERE IS ONE AND ONLY ONE THING THAT COULD JUSTIFY SUCH A VIOLATION OF LIBERTY AND OF THE CARDINAL PRINCIPLES OF RATIONAL GOVERNMENT AS IS EMBODIED IN THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT IN THE FACE OF DESPERATE NECESSITY
2673-162130-0020 THERE MAY BE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE MOST DESPERATE REMEDY BUT SO FAR FROM THIS BEING A CASE OF DESPERATE NECESSITY NOTHING IS MORE UNANIMOUSLY ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL EXCEPT THOSE WHO LABOR UNDER AN OBSESSION
2673-162130-0021 THAN THAT THE EVIL OF DRINK HAS BEEN STEADILY DIMINISHING NOT ONLY DURING THE PERIOD OF PROHIBITION AGITATION BUT FOR MANY DECADES BEFORE THAT DRUNKENNESS HAD BEEN RAPIDLY DECLINING
2673-162130-0022 AND BOTH TEMPERATE DRINKING AND TOTAL ABSTINENCE CORRESPONDINGLY INCREASING IT IS UNNECESSARY TO APPEAL TO STATISTICS THE FAMILIAR EXPERIENCE OF EVERY MAN WHOSE MEMORY RUNS BACK TWENTY OR FORTY OR SIXTY YEARS
2673-162130-0023 IS SUFFICIENT TO PUT THE CASE BEYOND QUESTION AND EVERY SPECIES OF LITERARY AND HISTORICAL RECORD CONFIRMS THE CONCLUSION THIS VIOLENT ASSAULT UPON LIBERTY THIS CRUDE DEFIANCE OF THE MOST SETTLED PRINCIPLES OF LAWMAKING AND OF GOVERNMENT
2673-162130-0024 THIS DIVISION OF THE COUNTRY AS IT HAS BEEN WELL EXPRESSED INTO THE HUNTERS AND THE HUNTED THIS SOWING OF DRAGONS TEETH IN THE SHAPE OF LAWLESSNESS AND CONTEMPT FOR LAW
2673-162130-0025 HAS NOT BEEN THE DICTATE OF IMPERIOUS NECESSITY BUT THE INDULGENCE OF THE CRUDE DESIRE OF A HIGHLY ORGANIZED BUT ONE IDEAD MINORITY TO IMPOSE ITS STANDARDS OF CONDUCT UPON ALL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
2673-162130-0026 I AM NOT THINKING OF TOBACCO OR ANYTHING OF THE KIND TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW OR FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW IT MAY BE RELIGION
2673-162130-0027 THE TIME TO CALL A HALT IS NOW AND THE WAY TO CALL A HALT IS TO WIN BACK THE GROUND THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN LOST TO DO THAT WILL BE A SPLENDID VICTORY FOR ALL THAT WE USED TO THINK OF AS AMERICAN
2673-162130-0028 FOR LIBERTY FOR INDIVIDUALITY FOR THE FREEDOM OF EACH MAN TO CONDUCT HIS OWN LIFE IN HIS OWN WAY SO LONG AS HE DOES NOT VIOLATE THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS
2673-162130-0029 NOT KEPT FROM MISCHIEF TO OURSELVES BY A PATERNAL LAW COPPER FASTENED IN THE CONSTITUTION NOT WATCHED LIKE CHILDREN BY A HOST OF GUARDIANS AND SPIES AND INFORMERS
2674-155968-0000 WHEN I BECAME GOVERNOR THE CONSCIENCE OF THE PEOPLE WAS IN NO WAY OR SHAPE AROUSED
2674-155968-0001 THE PEOPLE ACCEPTED AND PRACTICED IN A MATTER OF COURSE WAY AS QUITE PROPER
2674-155968-0002 AND THE HIGH PURPOSE SANELY TO ACHIEVE WHAT WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MEET THESE NEEDS I KNEW BOTH THE MACHINE AND THE SILK STOCKING REFORMERS FAIRLY WELL FROM MANY YEARS CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH THEM THE MACHINE AS SUCH HAD NO IDEALS AT ALL
2674-155968-0003 ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE MEN COMPOSING IT DID HAVE ON THE OTHER HAND THE IDEALS OF VERY MANY OF THE SILK STOCKING REFORMERS
2674-155968-0004 AND SINGULARLY ENOUGH IN INTERNATIONAL MATTERS THESE SAME SILK STOCKINGS WERE NO MORE TO BE TRUSTED THAN THE AVERAGE IGNORANT DEMAGOGUE OR SHORTSIGHTED SPOILS POLITICIANS I FELT THAT THESE MEN WOULD BE BROKEN REEDS TO WHICH TO TRUST
2674-155968-0005 IN ANY VITAL CONTEST FOR BETTERMENT OF SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS I HAD NEITHER THE TRAINING NOR THE CAPACITY THAT WOULD HAVE ENABLED ME TO MATCH MISTER PLATT AND HIS MACHINE PEOPLE ON THEIR OWN GROUND NOR DID I BELIEVE THAT THE EFFORT TO BUILD UP A MACHINE OF MY OWN
2674-155968-0006 UNDER THE THEN EXISTING CONDITIONS WOULD MEET THE NEEDS OF THE SITUATION SO FAR AS THE PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED I THEREFORE MADE NO EFFORT TO CREATE A MACHINE OF MY OWN AND CONSISTENTLY ADOPTED THE PLAN OF GOING OVER THE HEADS OF THE MEN HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE AND OF THE MEN IN CONTROL OF THE ORGANIZATION
2674-155968-0007 AND APPEALING DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE BEHIND THEM THE MACHINE FOR INSTANCE HAD A MORE OR LESS STRONG CONTROL OVER THE GREAT BULK OF THE MEMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE BUT IN THE LAST RESORT THE PEOPLE BEHIND THESE LEGISLATORS HAD A STILL GREATER CONTROL OVER THEM
2674-155968-0008 I MADE UP MY MIND THAT THE ONLY WAY I COULD BEAT THE BOSSES WHENEVER THE NEED TO DO SO AROSE AND UNLESS THERE WAS SUCH NEED I DID NOT WISH TO TRY WAS NOT BY ATTEMPTING TO MANIPULATE THE MACHINERY AND NOT BY TRUSTING MERELY TO THE PROFESSIONAL REFORMERS
2674-155968-0009 BUT BY MAKING MY APPEAL AS DIRECTLY AND AS EMPHATICALLY AS I KNEW HOW TO THE MASS OF VOTERS THEMSELVES TO THE PEOPLE TO THE MEN WHO IF WAKED UP WOULD BE ABLE TO IMPOSE THEIR WILL ON THEIR REPRESENTATIVES
2674-155968-0010 MY SUCCESS DEPENDED UPON GETTING THE PEOPLE IN THE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS TO LOOK AT MATTERS IN MY WAY AND GETTING THEM TO TAKE SUCH AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN AFFAIRS AS TO ENABLE THEM TO EXERCISE CONTROL OVER THEIR REPRESENTATIVES
2674-155968-0011 THERE WERE A FEW OF THE SENATORS AND ASSEMBLYMEN WHOM I COULD REACH BY SEEING THEM PERSONALLY AND PUTTING BEFORE THEM MY ARGUMENTS BUT MOST OF THEM WERE TOO MUCH UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE MACHINE FOR ME TO SHAKE THEM LOOSE UNLESS THEY KNEW THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ACTIVELY BEHIND ME
2674-155968-0012 IN MAKING MY APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE AS A WHOLE I WAS DEALING WITH AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CONSTITUENCY FROM THAT WHICH ESPECIALLY IN THE BIG CITIES LIKED TO THINK OF ITSELF AS THE BETTER ELEMENT THE PARTICULAR EXPONENT OF REFORM AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP
2674-155968-0013 I WAS DEALING WITH SHREWD HARD HEADED KINDLY MEN AND WOMEN CHIEFLY CONCERNED WITH THE ABSORBING WORK OF EARNING THEIR OWN LIVING AND IMPATIENT OF FADS WHO HAD GROWN TO FEEL THAT THE ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE WORD REFORMER WERE NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THE ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE WORD POLITICIAN
2674-155968-0014 I HAD TO CONVINCE THESE MEN AND WOMEN OF MY GOOD FAITH AND MOREOVER OF MY COMMON SENSE AND EFFICIENCY THEY WERE MOST OF THEM STRONG PARTISANS AND AN OUTRAGE HAD TO BE VERY REAL AND VERY GREAT TO SHAKE THEM EVEN PARTIALLY LOOSE FROM THEIR PARTY AFFILIATIONS MOREOVER
2674-155968-0015 THEY TOOK LITTLE INTEREST IN ANY FIGHT OF MERE PERSONALITIES THEY WERE NOT INFLUENCED IN THE LEAST BY THE SILK STOCKING REFORM VIEW OF MISTER PLATT I KNEW THAT IF THEY WERE PERSUADED THAT I WAS ENGAGED IN A MERE FACTION FIGHT AGAINST HIM THAT IT WAS A MERE ISSUE BETWEEN HIS AMBITION AND MINE
2674-155968-0016 THEY WOULD AT ONCE BECOME INDIFFERENT AND MY FIGHT WOULD BE LOST BUT I FELT THAT I COULD COUNT ON THEIR SUPPORT WHEREVER I COULD SHOW THEM THAT THE FIGHT WAS NOT MADE JUST FOR THE SAKE OF THE ROW THAT IT WAS NOT MADE MERELY AS A FACTIONAL CONTEST AGAINST SENATOR PLATT AND THE ORGANIZATION
2674-155968-0017 BUT WAS WAGED FROM A SENSE OF DUTY FOR REAL AND TANGIBLE CAUSES SUCH AS THE PROMOTION OF GOVERNMENTAL EFFICIENCY AND HONESTY AND FORCING POWERFUL MONEYED MEN TO TAKE THE PROPER ATTITUDE TOWARD THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE
2674-155968-0018 THEY STOOD BY ME WHEN I INSISTED UPON HAVING THE CANAL DEPARTMENT THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT AND THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT RUN WITH EFFICIENCY AND HONESTY THEY STOOD BY ME WHEN I INSISTED UPON MAKING WEALTHY MEN WHO OWNED FRANCHISES
2674-155968-0019 PAY THE STATE WHAT THEY PROPERLY OUGHT TO PAY THEY STOOD BY ME WHEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE STRIKES ON THE CROTON AQUEDUCT AND IN BUFFALO I PROMPTLY USED THE MILITARY POWER OF THE STATE TO PUT A STOP TO RIOTING AND VIOLENCE IN THE LATTER CASE
2674-155968-0020 MY CHIEF OPPONENTS AND CRITICS WERE LOCAL POLITICIANS WHO WERE TRUCKLING TO THE LABOR VOTE BUT IN ALL CASES COMING UNDER THE FIRST TWO CATEGORIES I HAD SERIOUS TROUBLE WITH THE STATE LEADERS OF THE MACHINE I ALWAYS DID MY BEST IN GOOD FAITH
2674-155968-0021 TO GET MISTER PLATT AND THE OTHER HEADS OF THE MACHINE TO ACCEPT MY VIEWS AND TO CONVINCE THEM BY REPEATED PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS THAT I WAS RIGHT I NEVER WANTONLY ANTAGONIZED OR HUMILIATED THEM I DID NOT WISH TO HUMILIATE THEM OR TO SEEM VICTORIOUS OVER THEM
2674-155968-0022 WHAT I WISHED WAS TO SECURE THE THINGS THAT I THOUGHT IT ESSENTIAL TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE STATE TO SECURE IF I COULD FINALLY PERSUADE THEM TO SUPPORT ME WELL AND GOOD IN SUCH CASE I CONTINUED TO WORK WITH THEM IN THE FRIENDLIEST MANNER IF AFTER
2674-155968-0023 REPEATED AND PERSISTENT EFFORT I FAILED TO GET THEM TO SUPPORT ME THEN I MADE A FAIR FIGHT IN THE OPEN AND IN A MAJORITY OF CASES I CARRIED MY POINT AND SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THROUGH THE LEGISLATION WHICH I WISHED IN THEORY THE EXECUTIVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LEGISLATION
2674-155968-0024 IN PRACTICE AS THINGS NOW ARE THE EXECUTIVE IS OR OUGHT TO BE PECULIARLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE AS A WHOLE AS OFTEN AS NOT THE ACTION OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFERS THE ONLY MEANS BY WHICH THE PEOPLE CAN GET THE LEGISLATION THEY DEMAND AND OUGHT TO HAVE
2674-155968-0025 THEREFORE A GOOD EXECUTIVE UNDER THE PRESENT CONDITIONS OF AMERICAN POLITICAL LIFE MUST TAKE A VERY ACTIVE INTEREST IN GETTING THE RIGHT KIND OF LEGISLATION IN ADDITION TO PERFORMING HIS EXECUTIVE DUTIES WITH AN EYE SINGLE TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE
2674-155968-0026 MORE THAN HALF OF MY WORK AS GOVERNOR WAS IN THE DIRECTION OF GETTING NEEDED AND IMPORTANT LEGISLATION I ACCOMPLISHED THIS ONLY BY AROUSING THE PEOPLE AND RIVETING THEIR ATTENTION ON WHAT WAS DONE GRADUALLY
2674-155968-0027 TO THE FACT THAT THE MACHINE POLITICIANS WERE NOT GIVING THEM THE KIND OF GOVERNMENT WHICH THEY WISHED AS THIS WAKING UP GREW MORE GENERAL NOT MERELY IN NEW YORK OR ANY OTHER ONE STATE BUT THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE NATION THE POWER OF THE BOSSES WANED
2674-155968-0028 THEN A CURIOUS THING HAPPENED THE PROFESSIONAL REFORMERS WHO HAD MOST LOUDLY CRITICIZED THESE BOSSES BEGAN TO CHANGE TOWARD THEM NEWSPAPER EDITORS COLLEGE PRESIDENTS CORPORATION LAWYERS AND BIG BUSINESS MEN ALL ALIKE
2674-155968-0029 HAD DENOUNCED THE BOSSES AND HAD TAKEN PART IN REFORM MOVEMENTS AGAINST THEM SO LONG AS THESE REFORMS DEALT ONLY WITH THINGS THAT WERE SUPERFICIAL OR WITH FUNDAMENTAL THINGS THAT DID NOT AFFECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR ASSOCIATES
2674-155968-0030 BUT THE MAJORITY OF THESE MEN TURNED TO THE SUPPORT OF THE BOSSES WHEN THE GREAT NEW MOVEMENT BEGAN CLEARLY TO MAKE ITSELF EVIDENT AS ONE AGAINST PRIVILEGE IN BUSINESS NO LESS THAN AGAINST PRIVILEGE IN POLITICS
2674-155968-0031 AS ONE FOR SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL NO LESS THAN FOR POLITICAL RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FAIR DEALING THE BIG CORPORATION LAWYER WHO HAD ANTAGONIZED THE BOSS IN MATTERS WHICH HE REGARDED AS PURELY POLITICAL STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THE BOSS WHEN THE MOVEMENT FOR BETTERMENT
2674-155968-0032 TOOK SHAPE IN DIRECT ATTACK ON THE COMBINATION OF BUSINESS WITH POLITICS AND WITH THE JUDICIARY WHICH HAS DONE SO MUCH TO ENTHRONE PRIVILEGE IN THE ECONOMIC WORLD THE REFORMERS WHO DENOUNCED POLITICAL CORRUPTION AND FRAUD
2674-155968-0033 WHEN SHOWN AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR OWN CANDIDATES BY MACHINE WARD HEELERS OF A LOW TYPE HYSTERICALLY APPLAUDED SIMILAR CORRUPT TRICKERY WHEN PRACTICED BY THESE SAME POLITICIANS AGAINST MEN WITH WHOSE POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROGRAMME THE REFORMERS WERE NOT IN SYMPATHY
2674-155968-0034 I HAD ALWAYS BEEN INSTINCTIVELY AND BY NATURE A DEMOCRAT BUT IF I HAD NEEDED CONVERSION TO THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAL HERE IN AMERICA
2674-155968-0035 BUT OF THE BULK OF THE MEN WHO MOST PRIDED THEMSELVES UPON THEIR EDUCATION AND CULTURE WHEN WE BEGAN IN GOOD FAITH TO GRAPPLE WITH THE WRONG AND INJUSTICE OF OUR SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM AND TO HIT AT THE MEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WRONG
2674-155968-0036 NO MATTER HOW HIGH THEY STOOD IN BUSINESS OR IN POLITICS AT THE BAR OR ON THE BENCH IT WAS WHILE I WAS GOVERNOR AND ESPECIALLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX LEGISLATION THAT I FIRST BECAME THOROUGHLY AWARE OF THE REAL CAUSES OF THIS ATTITUDE
2674-155968-0037 AMONG THE MEN OF GREAT WEALTH AND AMONG THE MEN WHO TOOK THEIR TONE FROM THE MEN OF GREAT WEALTH VERY SOON AFTER MY VICTORY IN THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR I HAD ONE OR TWO EXPERIENCES WITH SENATOR PLATT WHICH SHOWED IN AMUSING FASHION
2674-155968-0038 HOW ABSOLUTE THE RULE OF THE BOSS WAS IN THE POLITICS OF THAT DAY SENATOR PLATT WHO WAS ALWAYS MOST KIND AND FRIENDLY IN HIS PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH ME ASKED ME IN ONE DAY TO TALK OVER WHAT WAS TO BE DONE AT ALBANY HE HAD THE TWO OR THREE NOMINAL HEADS OF THE ORGANIZATION WITH HIM
2674-155968-0039 THEY WERE HIS LIEUTENANTS WHO COUNSELED AND INFLUENCED HIM WHOSE ADVICE HE OFTEN FOLLOWED BUT WHO WHEN HE HAD FINALLY MADE UP HIS MIND MERELY REGISTERED AND CARRIED OUT HIS DECREES AFTER A LITTLE CONVERSATION THE SENATOR ASKED IF I HAD ANY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY
2674-155968-0040 WHOM I WISHED TO HAVE PUT ON ANY COMMITTEE EXPLAINING THAT THE COMMITTEES WERE BEING ARRANGED I ANSWERED NO
2674-155968-0041 BECAUSE I HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD THE SPEAKER WHO APPOINTED THE COMMITTEES HAD HIMSELF BEEN AGREED UPON BY THE MEMBERS ELECT OH RESPONDED THE SENATOR WITH A TOLERANT SMILE HE HAS NOT BEEN CHOSEN YET BUT OF COURSE WHOEVER WE CHOOSE AS SPEAKER WILL AGREE BEFOREHAND TO MAKE THE APPOINTMENTS WE WISH
2674-155968-0042 I MADE A MENTAL NOTE TO THE EFFECT THAT IF THEY ATTEMPTED THE SAME PROCESS WITH THE GOVERNOR ELECT THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES MISTAKEN IN A FEW DAYS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE THIS ARRIVED
2674-155968-0043 THE TRANS STATE CANAL AND THESE SCANDALS HAD BEEN ONE OF THE CHIEF ISSUES IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE GOVERNORSHIP THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS WORK WAS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC WORKS IN THE ACTUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS HIS OFFICE WAS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT OFFICE UNDER ME
2674-155968-0044 AND I INTENDED TO APPOINT TO IT SOME MAN OF HIGH CHARACTER AND CAPACITY
2674-155968-0045 BUT WITHOUT REGARD TO POLITICS A WEEK OR SO AFTER THE SPEAKERSHIP INCIDENT SENATOR PLATT ASKED ME TO COME AND SEE HIM HE WAS AN OLD AND PHYSICALLY FEEBLE MAN ABLE TO MOVE ABOUT ONLY WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY ON ARRIVAL
2674-155968-0046 I FOUND THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ELECT MISTER WOODRUFF WHO HAD ALSO BEEN ASKED TO COME THE SENATOR INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS GLAD TO SAY THAT I WOULD HAVE A MOST ADMIRABLE MAN AS SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AS HE HAD JUST RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN WHOM HE NAMED
2674-155968-0047 SAYING THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT THE POSITION HE HANDED ME THE TELEGRAM THE MAN IN QUESTION WAS A MAN I LIKED
2674-155968-0048 BUT HE CAME FROM A CITY ALONG THE LINE OF THE CANAL
2674-155968-0049 AND MOREOVER WHAT WAS FAR MORE IMPORTANT IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE IT UNDERSTOOD AT THE VERY OUTSET THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS MY ADMINISTRATION AND WAS NO ONE ELSE'S BUT MINE SO I TOLD THE SENATOR VERY POLITELY THAT I WAS SORRY BUT THAT I COULD NOT APPOINT HIS MAN
2674-155968-0050 THIS PRODUCED AN EXPLOSION BUT I DECLINED TO LOSE MY TEMPER MERELY REPEATING THAT I MUST DECLINE TO ACCEPT ANY MAN CHOSEN FOR ME AND THAT I MUST CHOOSE THE MAN MYSELF ALTHOUGH I WAS VERY POLITE I WAS ALSO VERY FIRM AND MISTER PLATT AND HIS FRIENDS FINALLY ABANDONED THEIR POSITION
2674-155968-0051 A VETERAN OF THE CIVIL WAR COLONEL PARTRIDGE WHO HAD SERVED IN MAYOR LOW'S ADMINISTRATION HE WAS AN EXCELLENT MAN IN EVERY WAY HE CHOSE AS HIS ASSISTANT ACTIVELY TO SUPERINTEND THE WORK
2674-155968-0052 A MAN WITH NO POLITICAL BACKING AT ALL PICKED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WAS THE BEST EQUIPPED MAN FOR THE PLACE THE OFFICE THE MOST IMPORTANT OFFICE UNDER ME WAS RUN IN ADMIRABLE FASHION THROUGHOUT MY ADMINISTRATION
2674-155968-0053 RUN WITH A HIGHER STANDARD OF EFFICIENCY AND INTEGRITY BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL THAT HAD TO BE DONE ABOUT THE CANALS EVIDENTLY THE WHOLE POLICY HITHERTO PURSUED HAD BEEN FOOLISH AND INADEQUATE
2674-155968-0054 I APPOINTED A FIRST CLASS NON PARTISAN COMMISSION OF BUSINESS MEN AND EXPERT ENGINEERS WHO WENT INTO THE MATTER EXHAUSTIVELY AND THEIR REPORT SERVED AS THE BASIS UPON WHICH OUR ENTIRE PRESENT CANAL SYSTEM IS BASED
2674-155968-0055 AND WHOM I HAD DECLINED TO REAPPOINT HAD BEEN GUILTY OF ANY ACTION BECAUSE OF WHICH IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO PROCEED AGAINST THEM CRIMINALLY OR OTHERWISE UNDER THE LAW SUCH CRIMINAL ACTION HAD BEEN FREELY CHARGED AGAINST THEM DURING THE CAMPAIGN BY THE DEMOCRATIC
2674-155968-0056 INCLUDING THE SO CALLED MUGWUMP PRESS TO DETERMINE THIS MATTER I APPOINTED TWO DEMOCRATIC LAWYERS MESSRS FOX AND MAC FARLANE THE LATTER FEDERAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR NEW YORK UNDER PRESIDENT CLEVELAND AND PUT THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION IN THEIR HANDS
2674-155968-0057 THESE GENTLEMEN MADE AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION LASTING SEVERAL MONTHS THEY REPORTED THAT THERE HAD BEEN GRAVE DELINQUENCY IN THE PROSECUTION OF THE WORK DELINQUENCY WHICH JUSTIFIED PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT WHO WERE OUT OF OFFICE
2674-155968-0058 BUT THAT THERE WAS NO GROUND FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION I LAID THEIR REPORT BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WITH A MESSAGE IN WHICH I SAID THERE IS PROBABLY NO LAWYER OF HIGH STANDING IN THE STATE WHO
2674-155968-0059 AFTER STUDYING THE REPORT OF COUNSEL IN THIS CASE AND THE TESTIMONY TAKEN BY THE INVESTIGATING COMMISSION WOULD DISAGREE WITH THEM AS TO THE IMPRACTICABILITY OF A SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE ONE REMEDY WAS A THOROUGH CHANGE IN THE METHODS AND MANAGEMENT
2674-155968-0060 THIS CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE WHEN MY SUCCESSOR IN THE GOVERNORSHIP TOOK OFFICE COLONEL PARTRIDGE RETIRED AND ELON HOOKER FINDING THAT HE COULD NO LONGER ACT WITH ENTIRE DISREGARD OF POLITICS AND WITH AN EYE SINGLE TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE WORK ALSO LEFT
2674-155968-0061 A DOZEN YEARS LATER HAVING IN THE MEANTIME MADE A MARKED SUCCESS IN A BUSINESS CAREER HE BECAME THE TREASURER OF THE NATIONAL PROGRESSIVE PARTY MY ACTION IN REGARD TO THE CANALS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS OFFICE THE MOST IMPORTANT OFFICE UNDER ME BY COLONEL PARTRIDGE
2674-155968-0062 ESTABLISHED MY RELATIONS WITH MISTER PLATT FROM THE OUTSET ON PRETTY NEARLY THE RIGHT BASIS BUT BESIDES VARIOUS SMALL DIFFICULTIES WE HAD ONE OR TWO SERIOUS BITS OF TROUBLE BEFORE MY DUTIES AS GOVERNOR CEASED IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT MISTER PLATT WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES
2674-155968-0063 A LARGE PART OF AND SOMETIMES A MAJORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE THERE WERE A FEW ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT MEN SUCH AS NATHANIEL ELSBERG REGIS POST AND ALFORD COOLEY IN EACH OF THE TWO HOUSES THE REMAINDER WERE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC BOSSES
2674-155968-0064 THE TWO MACHINES WERE APT TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE IF THEIR VITAL INTERESTS WERE TOUCHED IT WAS MY BUSINESS TO DEVISE METHODS BY WHICH EITHER THE TWO MACHINES COULD BE KEPT APART OR ELSE OVERTHROWN IF THEY CAME TOGETHER MY DESIRE WAS TO ACHIEVE RESULTS
2674-155968-0065 AND NOT MERELY TO ISSUE MANIFESTOES OF VIRTUE IT IS VERY EASY TO BE EFFICIENT IF THE EFFICIENCY IS BASED ON UNSCRUPULOUSNESS AND IT IS STILL EASIER TO BE VIRTUOUS IF ONE IS CONTENT WITH THE PURELY NEGATIVE VIRTUE WHICH CONSISTS IN NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG
2674-155968-0066 BUT BEING WHOLLY UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING POSITIVE FOR GOOD MY FAVORITE QUOTATION FROM JOSH BILLINGS AGAIN APPLIES IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO BE A HARMLESS DOVE THAN A WISE SERPENT MY DUTY WAS TO COMBINE BOTH IDEALISM AND EFFICIENCY
2674-155968-0067 AT THAT TIME THE PUBLIC CONSCIENCE WAS STILL DORMANT AS REGARDS MANY SPECIES OF POLITICAL AND BUSINESS MISCONDUCT AS TO WHICH DURING THE NEXT DECADE IT BECAME SENSITIVE I HAD TO WORK WITH THE TOOLS AT HAND
2674-155968-0069 THAT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION IN THE MINDS OF HONEST MEN THAT MY PRIME PURPOSE WAS NOT TO ATTACK MISTER PLATT OR ANY ONE ELSE EXCEPT AS A NECESSARY INCIDENT TO SECURING CLEAN AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT IN EACH CASE I DID MY BEST TO PERSUADE MISTER PLATT NOT TO OPPOSE ME
2674-155968-0070 I ENDEAVORED TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO HIM THAT I WAS NOT TRYING TO WREST THE ORGANIZATION FROM HIM AND I ALWAYS GAVE HIM IN DETAIL THE REASONS WHY I FELT I HAD TO TAKE THE POSITION I INTENDED TO ADOPT IT WAS ONLY AFTER I HAD EXHAUSTED ALL THE RESOURCES OF MY PATIENCE
2674-155968-0071 THAT I WOULD FINALLY IF HE STILL PROVED OBSTINATE TELL HIM THAT I INTENDED TO MAKE THE FIGHT ANYHOW AS I HAVE SAID THE SENATOR WAS AN OLD AND FEEBLE MAN IN PHYSIQUE AND IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GO ABOUT VERY LITTLE
2674-155968-0072 UNTIL FRIDAY EVENING HE WOULD BE KEPT AT HIS DUTIES AT WASHINGTON WHILE I WAS IN ALBANY IF I WISHED TO SEE HIM IT GENERALLY HAD TO BE AT HIS HOTEL IN NEW YORK ON SATURDAY AND USUALLY I WOULD GO THERE TO BREAKFAST WITH HIM THE ONE THING I WOULD NOT PERMIT
2674-155968-0073 WAS ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF A SECRET OR CLANDESTINE MEETING I ALWAYS INSISTED ON GOING OPENLY SOLEMN REFORMERS OF THE TOM FOOL VARIETY WHO ACCORDING TO THEIR CUSTOM
2674-155968-0074 WERE MUCH EXERCISED OVER MY BREAKFASTING WITH PLATT WHENEVER I BREAKFASTED WITH HIM THEY BECAME SURE THAT THE FACT CARRIED WITH IT SOME SINISTER SIGNIFICANCE THE WORTHY CREATURES NEVER TOOK THE TROUBLE TO FOLLOW THE SEQUENCE OF FACTS AND EVENTS FOR THEMSELVES
2674-155968-0075 IF THEY HAD DONE SO THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT ANY SERIES OF BREAKFASTS WITH PLATT
2674-155968-0076 AND THAT I WAS TRYING COURTEOUSLY AND FRANKLY TO RECONCILE HIM TO IT MY OBJECT WAS TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO COME WITH ME AS LONG AS THERE WAS NO CLASH BETWEEN US THERE WAS NO OBJECT IN MY SEEING HIM
2674-155968-0077 IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE CLASH CAME OR WAS IMMINENT THAT I HAD TO SEE HIM A SERIES OF BREAKFASTS WAS ALWAYS THE PRELUDE TO SOME ACTIVE WARFARE IN EVERY INSTANCE I SUBSTANTIALLY CARRIED MY POINT
2674-155968-0078 TO ILLUSTRATE MY MEANING I QUOTE FROM A LETTER OF MINE TO SENATOR PLATT OF DECEMBER THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO GET ME TO PROMOTE A CERTAIN JUDGE X OVER THE HEAD OF ANOTHER JUDGE Y I WROTE
2674-155968-0079 THERE IS A STRONG FEELING AMONG THE JUDGES AND THE LEADING MEMBERS OF THE BAR THAT JUDGE Y OUGHT NOT TO HAVE JUDGE X JUMPED OVER HIS HEAD AND I DO NOT SEE MY WAY CLEAR TO DOING IT I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE SOLUTION I MENTIONED TO YOU
2674-155968-0080 IS THE SOLUTION I SHALL HAVE TO ADOPT REMEMBER THE BREAKFAST AT DOUGLAS ROBINSON'S AT EIGHT THIRTY THERE WERE VARIOUS MEASURES TO WHICH HE GAVE A GRUDGING AND QUERULOUS ASSENT WITHOUT ANY BREAK BEING THREATENED I SECURED THE REENACTMENT OF THE CIVIL SERVICE LAW
2674-155968-0081 WHICH UNDER MY PREDECESSOR HAD VERY FOOLISHLY BEEN REPEALED I SECURED A MASS OF LABOR LEGISLATION INCLUDING THE ENACTMENT OF LAWS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FACTORY INSPECTORS TO CREATE A TENEMENT HOUSE COMMISSION
2674-155968-0082 WHOSE FINDINGS RESULTED IN FURTHER AND EXCELLENT LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE HOUSING CONDITIONS TO REGULATE AND IMPROVE SWEATSHOP LABOR TO MAKE THE EIGHT HOUR AND PREVAILING RATE OF WAGES LAW EFFECTIVE
2674-155968-0083 TO SECURE THE GENUINE ENFORCEMENT OF THE ACT RELATING TO THE HOURS OF RAILWAY WORKERS TO COMPEL RAILWAYS TO EQUIP FREIGHT TRAINS WITH AIR BRAKES TO REGULATE THE WORKING HOURS OF WOMEN AND PROTECT BOTH WOMEN AND CHILDREN FROM DANGEROUS MACHINERY
2674-155968-0084 TO PROVIDE SEATS FOR THE USE OF WAITRESSES IN HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS TO REDUCE THE HOURS OF LABOR FOR DRUG STORE CLERKS TO PROVIDE FOR THE REGISTRATION OF LABORERS FOR MUNICIPAL EMPLOYMENT
2674-155968-0085 I TRIED HARD BUT FAILED TO SECURE AN EMPLOYERS LIABILITY LAW AND THE STATE CONTROL OF EMPLOYMENT OFFICES THERE WAS HARD FIGHTING OVER SOME OF THESE BILLS AND WHAT WAS MUCH MORE SERIOUS THERE WAS EFFORT TO GET ROUND THE LAW BY TRICKERY
2674-155968-0086 AND BY SECURING ITS INEFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT
2674-155968-0087 MEN SUCH AS JAMES BRONSON REYNOLDS THROUGH WHOM I FIRST BECAME INTERESTED IN SETTLEMENT WORK ON THE EAST SIDE ONCE OR TWICE I WENT SUDDENLY DOWN TO NEW YORK CITY WITHOUT WARNING ANY ONE AND TRAVERSED THE TENEMENT HOUSE QUARTERS VISITING VARIOUS SWEAT SHOPS PICKED AT RANDOM
2674-155968-0088 JAKE RIIS ACCOMPANIED ME
2674-155968-0089 WE GOT NOT ONLY AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE LAW BUT A STILL MORE MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN ITS ADMINISTRATION THANKS CHIEFLY TO THE ACTIVITY AND GOOD SENSE OF DOCTOR JOHN H PRYOR OF BUFFALO AND BY THE USE OF EVERY POUND OF PRESSURE WHICH AS GOVERNOR I COULD BRING TO BEAR
2674-155968-0090 IN LEGITIMATE FASHION INCLUDING A SPECIAL EMERGENCY MESSAGE WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THROUGH A BILL PROVIDING FOR THE FIRST STATE HOSPITAL FOR INCIPIENT TUBERCULOSIS WE GOT VALUABLE LAWS FOR THE FARMER
2674-155968-0091 LAWS PREVENTING THE ADULTERATION OF FOOD PRODUCTS WHICH LAWS WERE EQUALLY VALUABLE TO THE CONSUMER AND LAWS HELPING THE DAIRYMAN IN ADDITION TO LABOR LEGISLATION I WAS ABLE TO DO A GOOD DEAL FOR FOREST PRESERVATION AND THE PROTECTION OF OUR WILD LIFE
2674-155968-0092 ALL THAT LATER I STROVE FOR IN THE NATION IN CONNECTION WITH CONSERVATION WAS FORESHADOWED BY WHAT I STROVE TO OBTAIN FOR NEW YORK STATE WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR AND I WAS ALREADY WORKING IN CONNECTION WITH GIFFORD PINCHOT AND NEWELL
2674-155968-0093 I SECURED BETTER ADMINISTRATION AND SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE LAWS THEMSELVES THE IMPROVEMENT IN ADMINISTRATION AND IN THE CHARACTER OF THE GAME AND FOREST WARDENS WAS SECURED PARTLY AS THE RESULT OF A CONFERENCE
2674-155968-0094 IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBER WHICH I HELD WITH FORTY OF THE BEST GUIDES AND WOODSMEN OF THE ADIRONDACKS AS REGARDS MOST LEGISLATION EVEN THAT AFFECTING LABOR AND THE FORESTS I GOT ON FAIRLY WELL WITH THE MACHINE BUT ON THE TWO ISSUES IN WHICH BIG BUSINESS
2674-155968-0095 AND THE KIND OF POLITICS WHICH IS ALLIED TO BIG BUSINESS WERE MOST INVOLVED WE CLASHED HARD AND CLASHING WITH SENATOR PLATT MEANT CLASHING WITH THE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATION AND WITH THE ORGANIZED MAJORITY IN EACH HOUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE
2674-155968-0096 ONE CLASH WAS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE A MAN WHOSE OFFICE MADE HIM A FACTOR OF IMMENSE IMPORTANCE IN THE BIG BUSINESS CIRCLES OF NEW YORK THE THEN INCUMBENT OF THE OFFICE WAS AN EFFICIENT MAN THE BOSS OF AN UP STATE COUNTY
2674-155968-0097 A VETERAN POLITICIAN AND ONE OF MISTER PLATT'S RIGHT HAND MEN CERTAIN INVESTIGATIONS WHICH I MADE IN THE COURSE OF THE FIGHT SHOWED THAT THIS SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE
2674-155968-0098 THESE OPERATIONS HAD THROWN HIM INTO A PECULIARLY INTIMATE BUSINESS CONTACT OF ONE SORT AND ANOTHER WITH VARIOUS FINANCIERS WITH WHOM I DID NOT DEEM IT EXPEDIENT THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE WHILE SUCH SHOULD HAVE ANY INTIMATE AND SECRET MONEY MAKING RELATIONS
2674-155968-0099 MOREOVER THE GENTLEMAN IN QUESTION REPRESENTED THE STRAITEST SECT OF THE OLD TIME SPOILS POLITICIANS I THEREFORE DETERMINED NOT TO REAPPOINT HIM UNLESS I COULD GET HIS SUCCESSOR CONFIRMED HOWEVER HE WOULD STAY IN UNDER THE LAW
2674-155968-0100 AND THE REPUBLICAN MACHINE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF TAMMANY EXPECTED TO CONTROL FAR MORE THAN A MAJORITY OF ALL THE SENATORS MISTER PLATT ISSUED AN ULTIMATUM TO ME THAT THE INCUMBENT MUST BE REAPPOINTED OR ELSE THAT HE WOULD FIGHT
2674-155968-0101 AND THAT IF HE CHOSE TO FIGHT THE MAN WOULD STAY IN ANYHOW BECAUSE I COULD NOT OUST HIM FOR UNDER THE NEW YORK CONSTITUTION THE ASSENT OF THE SENATE WAS NECESSARY NOT ONLY TO APPOINT A MAN TO OFFICE BUT TO REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE AS ALWAYS WITH MISTER PLATT
2674-155968-0102 I PERSISTENTLY REFUSED TO LOSE MY TEMPER NO MATTER WHAT HE SAID HE WAS MUCH TOO OLD AND PHYSICALLY FEEBLE FOR THERE TO BE ANY POINT OF HONOR IN TAKING UP ANY OF HIS REMARKS AND I MERELY EXPLAINED GOOD HUMOREDLY THAT I HAD MADE UP MY MIND AND THAT THE GENTLEMAN IN QUESTION WOULD NOT BE RETAINED
2674-155968-0103 AS FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO GET HIS SUCCESSOR CONFIRMED I POINTED OUT THAT AS SOON AS THE LEGISLATURE ADJOURNED I COULD AND WOULD APPOINT ANOTHER MAN TEMPORARILY MISTER PLATT THEN SAID THAT THE INCUMBENT WOULD BE PUT BACK AS SOON AS THE LEGISLATURE RECONVENED
2674-155968-0104 I ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS POSSIBLE BUT ADDED CHEERFULLY THAT I WOULD REMOVE HIM AGAIN JUST AS SOON AS THAT LEGISLATURE ADJOURNED AND THAT EVEN THOUGH I HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE TIME MYSELF I WOULD GUARANTEE TO MAKE MY OPPONENTS MORE UNCOMFORTABLE STILL
2674-155968-0105 WE PARTED WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF REACHING AN AGREEMENT THERE REMAINED SOME WEEKS BEFORE FINAL ACTION COULD BE TAKEN AND THE SENATOR WAS CONFIDENT THAT I WOULD HAVE TO YIELD HIS MOST EFFICIENT ALLIES WERE THE PRETENDED REFORMERS
2674-155968-0106 MOST OF THEM MY OPEN OR COVERT ENEMIES WHO LOUDLY INSISTED THAT I MUST MAKE AN OPEN FIGHT ON THE SENATOR HIMSELF AND ON THE REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATION THIS WAS WHAT HE WISHED FOR AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO WAY OF UPSETTING HIM WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
2674-155968-0107 IF I HAD PERMITTED THE CONTEST TO ASSUME THE SHAPE OF A MERE FACTION FIGHT BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE UNITED STATES SENATOR I WOULD HAVE INSURED THE VICTORY OF THE MACHINE SO I BLANDLY REFUSED TO LET THE THING BECOME A PERSONAL FIGHT EXPLAINING AGAIN AND AGAIN
2674-155968-0108 THAT I WAS PERFECTLY WILLING TO APPOINT AN ORGANIZATION MAN
2674-155968-0109 BUT ALSO EXPLAINING THAT I WOULD NOT RETAIN THE INCUMBENT AND WOULD NOT APPOINT ANY MAN OF HIS TYPE MEANWHILE
2688-144986-0000 ENACT AT ONCE A FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASON LAW ON THE REMNANT OF RUFFED GROUSE QUAIL WOODCOCK SNIPE AND ALL SHORE BIRDS EVEN IN THE HOME OF THE NEWEST AND DEADLIEST AUTOLOADING SHOTGUN
2688-144986-0001 THE TERMS OF THE GAME COMMISSIONERS SHOULD BE NOT LESS THAN FOUR YEARS LIKE SO MANY OTHER STATES CONNECTICUT HAS RECKLESSLY WASTED HER WILD LIFE INHERITANCE DURING THE FIFTEEN YEARS PRECEDING THE YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT
2688-144986-0002 THE BIRD LIFE OF THAT STATE HAD DECREASED SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT ON MARCH SIXTH NINETEEN TWELVE
2688-144986-0003 AND THE PROTECTION OF GAME THIS FACT WE HAVE MORE COVER THAN THERE WAS THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AGO MORE BRUSH PROBABLY BUT THERE IS NOT ONE PARTRIDGE RUFFED GROUSE TODAY WHERE THERE WERE TWENTY TEN YEARS AGO
2688-144986-0004 FIRST OF ALL CONNECTICUT NEEDS A TEN YEAR CLOSE SEASON LAW TO SAVE HER REMNANT OF SHORE BIRDS BEFORE IT IS COMPLETELY ANNIHILATED THEN SHE NEEDS A BAYNE LAW AND NEEDS IT BADLY UNDER SUCH A LAW
2688-144986-0005 AND THE TAGGING SYSTEM THAT IT PROVIDES THE STATE GAME WARDENS WOULD HAVE SO STRONG A GRIP ON THE SITUATION THAT THE PRESENT UNLAWFUL SALE OF GAME WOULD BE COMPLETELY STOPPED HALF WAY MEASURES IN PREVENTING THE SALE OF GAME WILL NOT ANSWER
2688-144986-0006 MEN OF CONNECTICUT SAVE THE LAST REMNANTS OF YOUR NATIVE GAME BIRDS BEFORE THEY ARE ALL UTTERLY EXTERMINATED WITHIN YOUR BORDERS DON'T ASK THE KILLERS OF GAME WHAT THEY WILL AGREE TO BUT MAKE THE LAWS WHAT YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD BE
2688-144986-0007 IF YOU WANT A GAMELESS STATE LET THE DESTRUCTION GO ON AS IT NOW IS GOING WITH SIXTEEN THOUSAND LICENSED GUNNERS IN THE FIELD EACH YEAR AND YOU WILL SURELY HAVE IT RIGHT SOON DELAWARE
2688-144986-0008 STOP ALL SPRING SHOOTING AT ONCE STOP KILLING SHORE BIRDS FOR TEN YEARS AND PROTECT SWANS INDEFINITELY ENACT BAG LIMIT LAWS IN VERY SMALL FIGURES
2688-144986-0009 DELAWARE CAN STEP OUT OF HER POSITION AT THE REAR OF THE PROCESSION OF STATES AND TAKE A PLACE IN THE FRONT RANK WILL SHE DO IT WE HOPE SO FOR HER PRESENT STATUS IS UNWORTHY OF ANY RIGHT MINDED RED BLOODED STATE THIS SIDE OF THE PHILIPPINES
2688-144986-0010 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THE SALE OF ALL NATIVE WILD GAME REGARDLESS OF ITS SOURCE SHOULD BE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY BY THE ENACTMENT OF A COMPLETE BAYNE LAW
2688-144986-0011 IF GAME SHOOTING WITHIN THE DISTRICT IS CONTINUED ON THE MARSHES OF THE EASTERN BRANCH AND ON THE POTOMAC RIVER COMMON DECENCY DEMANDS THE ENACTMENT OF BAG LIMIT LAWS AND LONG CLOSE SEASON LAWS OF THE MOST MODERN PATTERN
2688-144986-0012 JUST WHY IT IS THAT GROSS ABUSES AGAINST WILD LIFE HAVE SO LONG BEEN TOLERATED IN THE TERRITORIAL CENTER OF THE AMERICAN NATION REMAINS TO BE ASCERTAINED BUT WHATEVER THE REASON THE SITUATION IS ABSURD AND INTOLERABLE
2688-144986-0013 AND CONGRESS SHOULD TERMINATE IT IMMEDIATELY AS LATE AS EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN AND I THINK FOR TWO OR THREE
2688-144986-0014 AS A SPECTACLE FOR GODS AND MEN BEHOLD TO DAY THE SALE OF QUAIL RUFFED GROUSE WILD TURKEYS AND OTHER AMERICAN GAME HALF WAY BETWEEN THE CAPITOL AND THE WHITE HOUSE
2688-144986-0015 LOOK AT CENTER MARKET AS A NATIONAL FENCE FOR THE SALE OF GAME STOLEN BY MARKET GUNNERS FROM MARYLAND VIRGINIA THE CAROLINAS AND PENNSYLVANIA IT IS TIME FOR CONGRESS TO BRING THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SHARPLY INTO LINE
2688-144986-0016 THE REPUTATION OF THE NATIONAL CAPITAL DEMANDS IT WHETHER THE GODS OF THE CAFES WILL CONSENT OR NOT FLORIDA SHOOTING SHORE BIRDS AND WATERFOWL IN LATE WINTER AND SPRING SHOULD BE STOPPED
2688-144986-0017 THE SALE OF ALL NATIVE WILD GAME SHOULD BE PROHIBITED A STATE GAME COMMISSIONER WHOSE TERM OF OFFICE SHOULD BE NOT LESS THAN FOUR YEARS AND A FORCE OF SALARIED GAME WARDENS SHOULD BE APPOINTED
2688-144986-0018 A GENERAL RESIDENT LICENSE SHOULD BE REQUIRED FOR HUNTING THE KILLING OF DOES AND FAWNS SHOULD BE STOPPED AND NO DEER SHOULD BE KILLED SAVE BUCKS WITH HORNS AT LEAST THREE INCHES LONG
2688-144986-0019 THE BAG LIMIT OF FIVE DEER PER YEAR SHOULD BE TWO DEER OF TWENTY QUAIL AND TWO TURKEYS PER DAY SHOULD BE TEN QUAIL AND ONE TURKEY THE OPEN SEASON ON ALL GAME BIRDS SHOULD END ON FEBRUARY FIRST FOR DOMESTIC REASONS
2688-144986-0020 THAT CAN BE FOUND ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES THE PLUME HUNTERS HAVE PRACTICALLY EXTERMINATED THE PLUME BEARING EGRETS WHOLLY ANNIHILATED THE ROSEATE SPOONBILL THE FLAMINGO AND ALSO THE CAROLINA PARRAKEET
2688-144986-0021 ONE OF THEM KILLED AN AUDUBON ASSOCIATION WARDEN GUY M BRADLEY WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO ENFORCE THE STATE LAWS PROTECTING THE EGRET ROOKERIES THE PEOPLE REALLY TO BLAME FOR THE SHOOTING OF GUY BRADLEY
2688-144986-0022 AND THE EXTERMINATION OF THE EGRETS BY LAWLESS AND DANGEROUS MEN ARE THE VAIN AND MERCILESS WOMEN WHO WEAR THE WHITE BADGES OF CRUELTY AS LONG AS THEY CAN BE PURCHASED THEY HAVE MUCH TO ANSWER FOR ORIGINALLY
2688-144986-0023 THE GENERAL BIRD LIFE OF FLORIDA DECREASED IN VOLUME SEVENTY SEVEN PER CENT IN NINETEEN HUNDRED IT WAS AT A VERY LOW POINT AND IT HAS STEADILY CONTINUED TO DECREASE
2688-144986-0024 THE RAPIDLY GROWING SETTLEMENT AND CULTIVATION OF THE STATE HAS OF COURSE HAD MUCH TO DO WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF WILD LIFE GENERALLY AND THE DRAINING AND EXPLOITATION OF THE EVERGLADES
2688-144986-0025 AND WILL RENDER POSTERITY GOOD SERVICE THE GREAT PRIVATE GAME AND BIRD PRESERVE OF DOCTOR RAY V PIERCE AT APALACHICOLA KNOWN AS SAINT VINCENT ISLAND CONTAINING TWENTY SQUARE MILES OF WONDERFUL WOODS AND WATERS
2688-144986-0026 I KNOW ONE MAN WHO NEVER ONCE EXCEEDED THE LIMIT OF TWENTY BIRDS PER DAY
2688-144986-0027 CAN THE QUAIL OF ANY STATE LONG ENDURE SUCH DRAINS AS THAT FROM A ZOOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW FLORIDA IS IN BAD SHAPE A GREAT MANY OF HER PEOPLE WHO SHOOT ARE DESPERATELY LAWLESS AND UNCONTROLLABLE
2688-144986-0028 AND THE STATE IS NOT FINANCIALLY ABLE TO SUPPORT A FORCE OF WARDENS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO ENFORCE THE LAWS EVEN AS THEY ARE IT LOOKS AS IF THE SLAUGHTER WOULD GO ON UNTIL NOTHING OF BIRD LIFE REMAINS
2688-144986-0029 AT PRESENT I CAN SEE NO HOPE WHATEVER FOR SAVING EVEN A GOOD REMNANT OF THE WILD LIFE OF THE STATE THE PRESENT STATUS OF WILD LIFE PROTECTIVE LAWS IN FLORIDA WAS MADE THE SUBJECT OF AN ARTICLE IN FOREST AND STREAM OF AUGUST TENTH NINETEEN TWELVE
2688-144986-0030 GAME COMMISSIONER OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA IN AN ARTICLE ENTITLED THE FLORIDA SITUATION IN VIEW OF HIS RECORD NO ONE WILL QUESTION EITHER THE VALUE OR THE HONEST SINCERITY OF MISTER WALLACE'S OPINIONS
2688-144986-0031 THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS ARE FROM THAT ARTICLE THE ENACTMENT OF A MODEL AND MODERN GAME LAW FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA IS ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE IN ORDER TO SAVE MANY OF THE MOST
2688-144986-0032 VALUABLE SPECIES OF BIRDS AND GAME OF THAT STATE FROM CERTAIN DEPLETION AND THREATENED EXTINCTION THE QUESTION OF THE PROTECTION OF THE BIRDS AND GAME IN FLORIDA IS NOT A LOCAL ONE BUT IS NATIONAL IN ITS SCOPE BIRDS KNOW NO STATE LINES
2688-144986-0033 AND WHILE PRACTICALLY ALL THE STATES LYING TO THE NORTH OF FLORIDA PROTECT MIGRATORY BIRDS AND WATERFOWL YET THESE ARE RECKLESSLY SLAUGHTERED IN THAT STATE TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO BE APPALLING TO ALL SPORTSMEN AND BIRD LOVERS
2688-144986-0034 SO ALARMING HAS BECOME THE DECREASE OF THE BIRDS AND GAME OF FLORIDA THAT UNLESS A HALT IS CALLED ON THE CAMPAIGN OF RECKLESS ANNIHILATION THAT HAS BEEN CEASELESSLY WAGED IN THAT STATE
2688-144986-0035 WILL LINGER ONLY IN HISTORY AND TRADITION IT IS THE SINCEREST HOPE OF ALL LOVERS OF WILD LIFE OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT THAT A STRONG AND INVINCIBLE SENTIMENT
2688-144986-0036 RELATIVE TO THE IMPERATIVE NECESSITY OF REAL CONSERVATION LEGISLATION BE CRYSTALLIZED IN THE MINDS OF THE MEMBERS ELECT OF THE FLORIDA LEGISLATURE
2688-144987-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY NEW LAWS NEEDED IN THE STATES CONTINUED MAINE THERE ARE REASONS FOR THE BELIEF THAT MAINE IS CONSERVING HER LARGE GAME BETTER THAN ANY OTHER STATE OR PROVINCE IN NORTH AMERICA
2688-144987-0001 ONE GLANCE OVER HER LAWS IS SUFFICIENT TO CONVINCE ANYONE THAT INSTEAD OF STUDYING THE CLAMOR OF HER SHOOTING POPULATION MAINE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN STUDYING THE NEEDS OF HER GAME AND PROVIDING FOR THOSE NEEDS IF ALL OTHER STATES WERE DOING EQUALLY WELL
2688-144987-0002 ONLY BULL MOOSE WITH AT LEAST TWO THREE INCH PRONGS ON ITS HORNS MAY BE KILLED CARIBOU HAVE HAD A CLOSE SEASON SINCE EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE ON GRAY AND BLACK SQUIRRELS DOVES AND QUAIL THERE IS NO OPEN SEASON
2688-144987-0003 THE OPEN SEASON FOR DEER VARIES FROM TEN WEEKS TO FOUR WEEKS AND IN PARTS OF THREE COUNTIES THERE IS NO OPEN SEASON AT ALL SILENCERS ARE PROHIBITED AND FIREARMS IN FORESTS MAY BE PROHIBITED BY THE GOVERNOR DURING DROUGHTS
2688-144987-0004 NEARLY ALL WILD FOWL SHOOTING ENDS JANUARY FIRST BUT IN TWO PLACES ON DECEMBER FIRST PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT LEARNED THE FACTS HABITUALLY THINK OF MAINE AS A VAST KILLING GROUND FOR DEER
2688-144987-0005 AND IT IS WELL FOR IT TO BE KNOWN THAT THE HUNTING GROUNDS HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY DESIGNATED ACCORDING TO THE ABUNDANCE OR SCARCITY OF GAME MAINE HAS WISELY CHOSEN TO REGARD HER HUNTING GROUNDS AND HER DEER AS A VALUABLE ASSET AND SHE MANAGES THEM ACCORDINGLY
2688-144987-0006 TO BE A GUIDE IN THAT STATE IS TO BE A GOOD CITIZEN AND A PROTECTOR OF GAME FROM ILLEGAL SLAUGHTER NO NON RESIDENT MAY HUNT WITHOUT A LICENSED GUIDE THE LICENSES FOR THE THOUSANDS OF DEER KILLED IN MAINE EACH YEAR
2688-144987-0007 AND THE EXPENSES OF THE VISITING SPORTSMEN WHO HUNT THEM ANNUALLY BRING INTO THE STATE AND LEAVE THERE A HUGE SUM OF MONEY VARIOUSLY ESTIMATED AT FROM
2688-144987-0008 THE SPLENDID SERVICES THAT HE RENDERED THE STATE OF MAINE DURING HIS THIRTEEN YEARS OF SERVICE ESPECIALLY IN THE CREATION OF A GOOD CODE OF GAME LAWS CONSTITUTE AN IMPERISHABLE MONUMENT TO HIS NAME AND FAME THERE IS VERY LITTLE THAT MAINE NEEDS
2688-144987-0009 FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES THE PINE TREE STATE IS TO BE CONGRATULATED UPON ITS WISE AND EFFICIENT HANDLING OF THE WILD LIFE SITUATION MARYLAND
2688-144987-0010 HOW HAS IT COME TO PASS THAT MARYLAND LACKS MORE GOOD WILD LIFE LAWS THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE UNION EXCEPT NORTH CAROLINA OF THE REALLY FUNDAMENTAL PROTECTIVE LAWS
2688-144987-0011 EMBRACING THE LIST THAT TO EVERY SELF RESPECTING STATE SEEMS INDISPENSABLE MARYLAND HAS ALMOST NONE SAVE CERTAIN BAG LIMIT LAWS OTHERWISE THE STATE IS WIDE OPEN
2688-144987-0012 IT IS INDEED HIGH TIME THAT SHE SHOULD ABANDON HER PRESENT ATTITUDE OF HOSTILITY TO WILD LIFE AND BECOME A GOOD NEIGHBOR SHE SHOULD DO WHAT IS FAIR AND RIGHT ABOUT THE PROTECTION OF THE MIGRATORY GAME AND BIRD LIFE THAT ANNUALLY PASSES TWICE THROUGH HER TERRITORY
2688-144987-0013 AT THE LAST SESSION OF THE MARYLAND LEGISLATURE THE LAW PREVENTING THE USE OF POWER BOATS IN WILD FOWL SHOOTING WAS REPEALED THAT WAS A STEP TEN YEARS BACKWARD
2688-144987-0015 THE USE OF MACHINE SHOTGUNS IN HUNTING SHOULD BE STOPPED AT ONCE STOP THE USE OF POWER BOATS IN WILD FOWL SHOOTING MASSACHUSETTS
2688-144987-0016 IN NINETEEN TWELVE THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS MOVED UP INTO THE FOREMOST RANK OF STATES WHERE FOR ONE YEAR NEW YORK HAD STOOD ALONE SHE PASSED A COUNTERPART OF THE NEW YORK LAW ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITING THE SALE OF ALL
2688-144987-0017 WILD AMERICAN GAME IN MASSACHUSETTS BUT PROVIDING FOR THE SALE OF GAME THAT HAS BEEN REARED IN PRESERVES AND TAGGED BY STATE OFFICERS THIS VICTORY WAS ACHIEVED ONLY AFTER THREE MONTHS OF HARD FIGHTING
2688-144987-0018 THE COALITION OF SPORTSMEN ZOOLOGISTS AND FRIENDS OF WILD LIFE IN GENERAL PROVED IRRESISTIBLE JUST AS A SIMILAR UNION OF FORCES ACCOMPLISHED THE BAYNE LAW IN NEW YORK IN NINETEEN ELEVEN THE VICTORY IS HIGHLY INSTRUCTIVE AS GREAT VICTORIES USUALLY ARE
2688-144987-0019 IT PROVES ONCE MORE THAT WHENEVER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN BE AROUSED FROM THEIR NORMAL APATHY REGARDING WILD LIFE ANY GOOD CONSERVATION LEGISLATION CAN BE ENACTED THE PRIME NECESSITIES TO SUCCESS ARE GOOD MEASURES GOOD MANAGEMENT
2688-144987-0020 A REASONABLE CAMPAIGN FUND AND TIRELESS ENERGY AND PERSISTENCE MASSACHUSETTS IS TO BE ROUNDLY CONGRATULATED ON HAVING SO THOROUGHLY CLEANED UP HER SALE OF GAME SITUATION INCIDENTALLY
2688-144987-0021 MASSACHUSETTS NEEDS A BAG LIMIT LAW MORE IN KEEPING WITH HER SMALL REMNANT OF WILD LIFE AND THAT SHE WILL HAVE ERE LONG VERY SOON ALSO HER SPORTSMEN WILL RAISE THE STANDARD OF ETHICS IN SHOTGUN SHOOTING
2688-144987-0022 BY BARRING OUT THE AUTOMATIC AND PUMP SHOTGUNS SO MUCH BELOVED BY THE MARKET SHOOTERS AS MATTERS STAND AT THIS DATE NINETEEN TWELVE THE OLD BAY STATE NEEDS THE FOLLOWING NEW LAWS
2688-144987-0023 LOW BAG LIMITS ON ALL GAME FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASONS ON ALL SHORE BIRDS SNIPE AND WOODCOCK EXPULSION OF THE AUTOMATIC AND PUMP SHOTGUNS IN HUNTING MICHIGAN
2688-144987-0024 ON THE WHOLE THE GAME LAWS OF MICHIGAN ARE IN EXCELLENT SHAPE AND LEAVE LITTLE TO BE DESIRED IN THE LINE OF BETTERMENT EXCEPT TO BE SIMPLIFIED ALL THE GAME PROTECTED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE IS DEBARRED FROM SALE
2688-144987-0025 MAKE IT FIFTEEN BIRDS PER DAY OF WATERFOWL ALL SPECIES COMBINED AND NO GROUSE OR QUAIL THERE SHOULD BE FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASONS ENACTED FOR QUAIL GROUSE PLOVER WOODCOCK SNIPE AND ALL OTHER SHORE BIRDS
2688-144987-0026 PROVISION SHOULD BE MADE FOR A LARGE STATE GAME REFUGE IN SOUTHERN MINNESOTA THE STATE SHOULD PROHIBIT THE USE OF MACHINE GUNS IN HUNTING TO DAY DIRECT AND RELIABLE ADVICES SHOW THAT THE GAME SITUATION IN MINNESOTA IS FAR FROM ENCOURAGING
2688-144987-0027 NOW WHAT IS MINNESOTA GOING TO DO ABOUT ALL THIS IS SHE WILLING THROUGH APATHY TO BECOME A GAMELESS STATE HER PEOPLE NEED TO AROUSE THEMSELVES NOW AND PASS SEVERAL STRONG LAWS
2688-144987-0028 HER BAG LIMIT OF FORTY FIVE BIRDS PER DAY OF QUAIL GROUSE WOODCOCK AND PLOVER AND FIFTY PER DAY OF THE WATERBIRDS IS A JOKE AND NOTHING MORE BUT IT IS NO LAUGHING MATTER IT SPELLS EXTERMINATION
2688-144987-0029 THE SHOOTING OF ALL WATER FOWL SHOULD CEASE ON JANUARY FIRST A REASONABLE LIMIT SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED ON DEER A HUNTING LICENSE LAW SHOULD BE PASSED AT ONCE
2688-144987-0030 IT IS SERIOUSLY TO THE DISCREDIT OF MISSISSIPPI THAT HER LAWS ACTUALLY CLASSIFY ROBINS CEDAR BIRDS GROSBEAKS AND DOVES AS GAME AND MAKE THEM KILLABLE AS SUCH FROM SEPTEMBER FIRST TO MARCH FIRST
2688-144987-0031 I SHOULD THINK THAT IF NO ECONOMIC CONSIDERATION CARRIED WEIGHT IN MISSISSIPPI STATE PRIDE ALONE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO PROMOTE A CORRECTION OF THE EVIL IF WE OF THE NORTH WERE TO SLAUGHTER MOCKINGBIRDS FOR FOOD WHEN THEY COME NORTH TO VISIT US
2688-144987-0032 AND THEY WOULD BE QUITE RIGHT MISSOURI THE MISSOURI BAG LIMITS THAT PERMIT THE KILLING OR POSSESSION OF FIFTY BIRDS PER DAY ARE ABSURD AND FATALLY LIBERAL THE UTMOST SHOULD BE TWENTY FIVE AND EVEN THAT IS TOO HIGH
2688-144987-0033 DOVES SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE LIST OF GAME BIRDS AND PROTECTED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND SO SHOULD ALL TREE SQUIRRELS SPRING SHOOTING OF SHORE BIRDS AND WATERFOWL SHOULD BE PROHIBITED WITHOUT DELAY
2688-144987-0034 THE STATE OF MISSOURI IS REALLY STRONG IN HER POSITION AS A GAME PROTECTING STATE SHE PERPETUALLY PROTECTS SUCH VANISHING SPECIES AS THE RUFFED GROUSE
2688-144987-0035 WILL EVEN YET PROFIT BY HER GOOD EXAMPLE MONTANA LIKE COLORADO AND WYOMING MONTANA IS WASTING A VALUABLE HERITAGE OF WILD GAME WHILE SHE STRUGGLES TO MAINTAIN THE THEORY THAT SHE STILL IS IN THE LIST OF STATES THAT FURNISH BIG GAME HUNTING
2688-144987-0036 IS OPTIMISTIC REGARDING EVEN THE BIG GAME AND BELIEVES THAT IT IS HOLDING ITS OWN THIS IS PARTIALLY TRUE OF WHITE TAILED DEER
2688-144987-0037 IT IS SAID THAT IN NINETEEN ELEVEN ELEVEN THOUSAND DEER WERE KILLED IN MONTANA ALL IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE STATE
2688-144987-0038 BUT QUITE RIGHT FOR ANTELOPES AND OTHER BIG GAME ALL THE GROUSE AND PTARMIGAN OF MONTANA NEED A FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASON THE SPLENDID SAGE GROUSE IS NOW EXTINCT IN MANY PARTS OF ITS PREVIOUS RANGE FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND LICENSED GUNNERS ARE TOO MANY FOR THEM
2688-144987-0039 THE FEW MOUNTAIN SHEEP AND MOUNTAIN GOATS THAT SURVIVE SHOULD HAVE A FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASON AT ONCE THE KILLING OF FEMALE HOOFED ANIMALS SHOULD BE PROHIBITED BY LAW MONTANA HAS NOT YET ADOPTED THE MODEL LAW FOR THE PROTECTION OF NON GAME BIRDS
2688-144987-0040 MONTANA'S BAG LIMITS ARE NOT WHOLLY BAD BUT THE GRIZZLY BEAR HAS ALMOST BEEN EXTERMINATED SAVE IN THE YELLOWSTONE PARK
2688-144987-0041 NEBRASKA NO OTHER STATE HAS BESTOWED CLOSE SEASONS UPON AS MANY EXTINCT SPECIES OF GAME AS NEBRASKA BEHOLD HOW SHE HAS RESOLUTELY LOCKED THE DOORS OF HER EMPTY CAGE
2688-144987-0042 AFTER ALL THESE SPECIES HAVE FLOWN ELK ANTELOPE WILD TURKEY PASSENGER PIGEON WHOOPING CRANE SAGE GROUSE PTARMIGAN AND CURLEW
2688-144987-0043 THERE IS LITTLE TO SAY REGARDING THE FUTURE OF THE GAME OF NEBRASKA FOR ITS FUTURE IS NOW HISTORY PROVISION SHOULD BE MADE FOR ONE OR MORE STATE GAME PRESERVES SPRING SHOOTING OF SHORE BIRDS AND WATERFOWL SHOULD BE PROHIBITED
2688-144987-0044 A LARGER AND MORE EFFECTIVE WARDEN SERVICE SHOULD BE PROVIDED DOVES SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE GAME LIST NEVADA THE SAGE GROUSE SHOULD BE GIVEN A TEN YEAR CLOSE SEASON FOR RECUPERATION
2688-144987-0045 ALL NON GAME BIRDS SHOULD HAVE PERPETUAL PROTECTION THE CRANES NOW VERGING ON EXTINCTION AND THE PIGEONS AND DOVES SHOULD AT ONCE BE TAKEN OUT OF THE LIST OF GAME BIRDS AND FOREVER PROTECTED
2688-144987-0046 ALL THE SHORE BIRDS NEED FIVE YEARS OF CLOSE PROTECTION A STATE GAME WARDEN WHOSE TERM OF OFFICE IS NOT LESS THAN FOUR YEARS SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR
2688-144987-0047 A CORPS OF SALARIED GAME PROTECTORS SHOULD BE CHOSEN FOR ACTIVE AND AGGRESSIVE GAME PROTECTION NEVADA'S BAG LIMITS ARE AMONG THE BEST OF ANY STATE THE ONLY SERIOUS FLAW BEING TEN SAGE GROUSE PER DAY WHICH SHOULD BE ZERO
2688-144987-0048 NEVADA STILL HAS A FEW ANTELOPE AND WE BEG HER TO PROTECT THEM ALL FROM BEING HUNTED OR KILLED IT IS MY BELIEF THAT IF THE ANTELOPE IS REALLY SAVED ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES OUTSIDE OF NATIONAL PARKS AND PRESERVES IT WILL BE IN THE WILD AND REMOTE REGIONS OF NEVADA
2688-144987-0049 AND IN FACT ALL GAME SAVE DEER THERE APPEAR TO BE NO BAG LIMITS ON THE QUANTITY THAT MAY BE KILLED IN A DAY OR A SEASON THE FOLLOWING BAG LIMITS ARE GREATLY NEEDED FORTHWITH GRAY SQUIRREL NONE PER DAY OR PER YEAR
2688-144987-0050 DUCK EXCEPT WOOD DUCK TEN PER DAY OR THIRTY PER SEASON RUFFED GROUSE FOUR PER DAY TWELVE PER SEASON HARE AND RABBIT FOUR PER DAY OR TWELVE PER SEASON
2688-144987-0051 FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASONS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE ENACTED FOR THE FOLLOWING SPECIES QUAIL WOODCOCK JACKSNIPE AND ALL SPECIES OF SHORE OR BEACH BIRDS THE SALE OF ALL NATIVE WILD GAME SHOULD BE PROHIBITED
2688-144987-0052 NEW JERSEY ENJOYS THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE SECOND STATE TO BREAK THE STRANGLE HOLD OF THE GUN MAKERS OF HARTFORD AND ILION AND CAST OUT THE ODIOUS AUTOMATIC AND PUMP GUNS IT WAS A PITCHED BATTLE THAT OF NINETEEN TWELVE
2688-144987-0053 INAUGURATED BY ERNEST NAPIER PRESIDENT OF THE STATE GAME AND FISH COMMISSION AND HIS FELLOW COMMISSIONERS THE LONGER THE CONTEST CONTINUED THE MORE DID THE PRESS AND THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY AWAKEN TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION
2688-144987-0054 FINALLY THE GUN SUPPRESSION BILL PASSED THE TWO HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE WITH A TOTAL OF ONLY FOURTEEN VOTES AGAINST IT AND AFTER A FULL HEARING HAD BEEN GRANTED THE ATTORNEYS OF THE GUNMAKERS WAS PROMPTLY SIGNED BY GOVERNOR WOODROW WILSON
2688-144987-0055 AND ALWAYS HAS GONE AS FAR AS THE KILLERS OF GAME WOULD PERMIT HER TO GO BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE MADE ONE GREAT MISTAKE COMMON TO NEARLY EVERY STATE OF PERMITTING THE GAME KILLERS TO DICTATE THE GAME LAWS
2688-144987-0056 ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE THIS IS A GRIEVOUS MISTAKE AND FATAL TO THE GAME FOR EXAMPLE IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX NEW JERSEY ENACTED A FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASON LAW ON THE PRAIRIE FOWL PINNATED GROUSE
2688-144987-0057 BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO SAVE IT NOW THAT SPECIES IS AS DEAD TO NEW JERSEY AS IS THE MASTODON THE MORAL IS WILL THE PEOPLE APPLY THIS LESSON TO THE RUFFED GROUSE QUAIL AND THE SHORE BIRDS GENERALLY BEFORE THEY TOO
2688-144987-0058 IF IT IS DONE IT MUST BE DONE AGAINST THE WILL OF THE GUNNERS FOR THEY PREFER TO SHOOT AND SHOOT THEY WILL IF THEY CAN DICTATE THE LAWS UNTIL THE LAST GAME BIRD IS DEAD
2688-144987-0059 IN NINETEEN TWELVE NEW JERSEY IS SPENDING THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TRYING TO RESTOCK HER BIRDLESS COVERS WITH FOREIGN GAME BIRDS AND QUAIL IN BRIEF HERE ARE THE IMPERATIVE DUTIES OF NEW JERSEY
2688-144987-0060 PROVIDE EIGHT YEAR CLOSE SEASONS FOR QUAIL RUFFED GROUSE WOODCOCK SNIPE ALL SHORE BIRDS AND THE WOOD DUCK PROHIBIT THE SALE OF ALL NATIVE WILD GAME BUT PROMOTE THE SALE OF PRESERVE BRED GAME
2688-144987-0061 PREVENT THE REPEAL OF THE AUTOMATIC GUN LAW WHICH SURELY WILL BE ATTEMPTED EACH YEAR PROHIBIT ALL BIRD SHOOTING AFTER JANUARY TENTH EACH YEAR UNTIL FALL
2688-144987-0062 PROHIBIT THE KILLING OF SQUIRRELS AS GAME NEW MEXICO ALL THINGS CONSIDERED THE GAME LAWS OF NEW MEXICO ARE SURPRISINGLY UP TO DATE
2688-144987-0063 IT IS CLEAR THAT NEW MEXICO IS WIDE AWAKE TO THE DANGERS OF THE WILD LIFE SITUATION ON TWO COUNTS HER LAWS ARE NOT QUITE PERFECT THERE IS NO LAW PROHIBITING SPRING SHOOTING AND THERE IS NO MODEL LAW PROTECTING THE NON GAME BIRDS
2688-144987-0064 THE SALE OF GAME WILL NOT TROUBLE NEW MEXICO BECAUSE THE PRESENT LAWS PREVENT THE SALE OF ALL PROTECTED GAME EXCEPT PLOVER CURLEW AND SNIPE ALL OF THEM SPECIES BY NO MEANS COMMON IN THE ARID REGIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST
2688-144987-0065 THE TERM OF THE STATE WARDEN SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO FOUR YEARS NEW YORK IN THE YEAR OF GRACE NINETEEN TWELVE I THINK WE MAY JUSTLY REGARD NEW YORK AS THE BANNER STATE OF ALL AMERICA
2688-144987-0066 AND DONE WELL NIGH THE UTMOST THAT ANY STATE CAN DO TO CLEAR HER BAD RECORD AND GIVE ALL HER WILD CREATURES A FAIR CHANCE TO SURVIVE THE PEOPLE OF THE EMPIRE STATE LITERALLY CAN POINT WITH PRIDE TO THE LIST OF THINGS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE DISCHARGE OF GOOD CITIZENSHIP
2688-144987-0067 TOWARD THE REMNANT OF WILD LIFE AND TOWARD THE FUTURE GENERATIONS OF NEW YORKERS THAT WE OF TO DAY HAVE BORNE OUR SHARE OF THE BURDEN OF BRINGING ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF NINETEEN TWELVE WILL BE A SOURCE OF SATISFACTION
2688-144987-0068 ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SWORD AND SHIELD HANG USELESS UPON THE WALLS OF OLD AGE NEW YORK BEGAN TO PROTECT HER DEER IN SEVENTEEN O FIVE AND HER HEATH HENS IN SEVENTEEN O EIGHT
2688-144987-0069 AND OF BUCKS HAVING HORNS LESS THAN THREE INCHES IN LENGTH SPRING SHOOTING WAS STOPPED IN NINETEEN O THREE A COMPREHENSIVE LAW PROTECTING NON GAME BIRDS WAS ENACTED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
2688-144987-0070 NEW YORK'S FIRST LAW AGAINST THE SALE OF CERTAIN GAME DURING CLOSE SEASONS WAS ENACTED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN IN NINETEEN ELEVEN NEW YORK ENACTED WITH ONLY ONE ADVERSE VOTE
2688-144987-0071 A LAW PROHIBITING THE SALE OF ALL NATIVE WILD GAME THROUGHOUT THE STATE NO MATTER WHERE KILLED AND PROVIDING LIBERALLY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF GAME BREEDING AND THE SALE OF PRESERVE BRED GAME IN NINETEEN TWELVE
2688-144987-0072 A NEW CODIFICATION OF THE STATE GAME LAWS WENT INTO EFFECT THROUGH THE INITIATIVE OF GOVERNOR DIX AND CONSERVATION COMMISSIONERS VAN KENNEN MOORE AND FLEMING ASSISTED AS SPECIAL COUNSEL
2688-144987-0073 GEORGE A LAWYER AND JOHN B BURNHAM THIS CODE CONTAINS MANY IMPORTANT NEW PROVISIONS ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE OF WHICH IS A CLAUSE GIVING THE CONSERVATION COMMISSION POWER
2688-144987-0074 IN NINETEEN TEN WILLIAM DUTCHER AND T GILBERT PEARSON AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF AUDUBON SOCIETIES WON AFTER A STRUGGLE LASTING FIVE YEARS THE PASSAGE OF THE SHEA PLUMAGE BILL PROHIBITING THE SALE OF AIGRETTES
2688-144987-0075 CHAP TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX THIS LAW SHOULD BE DUPLICATED IN EVERY STATE TWO THINGS REMAIN TO BE DONE IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK ALL THE SHORE BIRDS QUAIL
2688-144987-0076 AND GRAY SQUIRRELS OF THE STATE SHOULD BE GIVEN FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASONS BY THE ACTION OF THE STATE CONSERVATION COMMISSION FOR THE GOOD NAME OF THE STATE AND THE ETHICAL STANDING OF ITS SPORTSMEN
3008-164327-0000 THE THREE OF US WENT BACK TOWARDS THE PAVILION AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE BUILDING THE REPORTER MADE US STOP AND POINTING TO A SMALL CLUMP OF TREES TO THE RIGHT OF US SAID THAT'S WHERE THE MURDERER CAME FROM TO GET INTO THE PAVILION
3008-164327-0001 AS THERE WERE OTHER PATCHES OF TREES OF THE SAME SORT BETWEEN THE GREAT OAKS I ASKED WHY THE MURDERER HAD CHOSEN THAT ONE RATHER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS
3008-164327-0002 THAT PATH IS AS YOU SEE TOPPED WITH GRAVEL HE SAID THE MAN MUST HAVE PASSED ALONG IT GOING TO THE PAVILION SINCE NO TRACES OF HIS STEPS HAVE BEEN FOUND ON THE SOFT GROUND THE MAN DIDN'T HAVE WINGS HE WALKED
3008-164327-0003 BUT HE WALKED ON THE GRAVEL WHICH LEFT NO IMPRESSION OF HIS TREAD THE GRAVEL HAS IN FACT BEEN TRODDEN BY MANY OTHER FEET SINCE THE PATH IS THE MOST DIRECT WAY BETWEEN THE PAVILION AND THE CHATEAU AS TO THE THICKET
3008-164327-0004 AND THEN DADDY JACQUES LEAVE THE PAVILION GRAVEL HAS BEEN SPREAD NEARLY VERY NEARLY UP TO THE WINDOWS OF THE PAVILION THE FOOTPRINTS OF A MAN PARALLEL WITH THE WALL MARKS WHICH WE WILL EXAMINE PRESENTLY AND WHICH I HAVE ALREADY SEEN
3008-164327-0005 PROVE THAT HE ONLY NEEDED TO MAKE ONE STRIDE TO FIND HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE VESTIBULE WINDOW LEFT OPEN BY DADDY JACQUES THE MAN DREW HIMSELF UP BY HIS HANDS AND ENTERED THE VESTIBULE AFTER ALL IT IS VERY POSSIBLE
3008-164327-0006 I SAID AFTER ALL WHAT AFTER ALL WHAT CRIED ROULETABILLE I BEGGED OF HIM NOT TO BE ANGRY BUT HE WAS TOO MUCH IRRITATED TO LISTEN TO ME AND DECLARED IRONICALLY
3008-164327-0007 THAT HE ADMIRED THE PRUDENT DOUBT WITH WHICH CERTAIN PEOPLE APPROACHED THE MOST SIMPLE PROBLEMS RISKING NOTHING BY SAYING THAT IS SO OR THAT IS NOT SO
3008-164327-0008 THEIR INTELLIGENCE WOULD HAVE PRODUCED ABOUT THE SAME RESULT IF NATURE HAD FORGOTTEN TO FURNISH THEIR BRAIN PAN WITH A LITTLE GREY MATTER AS I APPEARED VEXED MY YOUNG FRIEND TOOK ME BY THE ARM AND ADMITTED THAT HE HAD NOT MEANT THAT FOR ME HE THOUGHT MORE OF ME THAN THAT
3008-164327-0009 IF I DID NOT REASON AS I DO IN REGARD TO THIS GRAVEL HE WENT ON I SHOULD HAVE TO ASSUME A BALLOON MY DEAR FELLOW THE SCIENCE OF THE AEROSTATION OF DIRIGIBLE BALLOONS IS NOT YET DEVELOPED ENOUGH FOR ME TO CONSIDER IT
3008-164327-0010 AND SUPPOSE THAT A MURDERER WOULD DROP FROM THE CLOUDS SO DON'T SAY A THING IS POSSIBLE WHEN IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE WE KNOW NOW HOW THE MAN ENTERED BY THE WINDOW AND WE ALSO KNOW THE MOMENT AT WHICH HE ENTERED
3008-164327-0011 DURING THE FIVE O'CLOCK WALK OF THE PROFESSOR AND HIS DAUGHTER THE FACT OF THE PRESENCE OF THE CHAMBERMAID WHO HAD COME TO CLEAN UP THE YELLOW ROOM IN THE LABORATORY WHEN MONSIEUR STANGERSON AND HIS DAUGHTER RETURNED FROM THEIR WALK AT HALF PAST ONE
3008-164327-0012 PERMITS US TO AFFIRM THAT AT HALF PAST ONE THE MURDERER WAS NOT IN THE CHAMBER UNDER THE BED UNLESS HE WAS IN COLLUSION WITH THE CHAMBERMAID WHAT DO YOU SAY MONSIEUR DARZAC MONSIEUR DARZAC SHOOK HIS HEAD
3008-164327-0013 AND SAID HE WAS SURE OF THE CHAMBERMAID'S FIDELITY AND THAT SHE WAS A THOROUGHLY HONEST AND DEVOTED SERVANT BESIDES HE ADDED AT FIVE O'CLOCK MONSIEUR STANGERSON WENT INTO THE ROOM TO FETCH HIS DAUGHTER'S HAT THERE IS THAT ALSO SAID ROULETABILLE
3008-164327-0014 THAT THE MAN ENTERED BY THE WINDOW AT THE TIME YOU SAY I ADMIT I SAID BUT WHY DID HE SHUT THE WINDOW IT WAS AN ACT WHICH WOULD NECESSARILY DRAW THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO HAD LEFT IT OPEN IT MAY BE THE WINDOW WAS NOT SHUT AT ONCE REPLIED THE YOUNG REPORTER
3008-164327-0015 BUT IF HE DID SHUT THE WINDOW IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE BEND IN THE GRAVEL PATH A DOZEN YARDS FROM THE PAVILION AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE THREE OAKS THAT ARE GROWING AT THAT SPOT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
3008-164327-0016 BUT I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYTHING OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO SAY ON THIS AFFAIR IF MY HYPOTHESIS IS JUSTIFIED AND WHAT IS YOUR HYPOTHESIS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW IF IT DOES NOT TURN OUT TO BE THE TRUTH
3008-164327-0017 IT IS OF MUCH TOO GRAVE A NATURE TO SPEAK OF IT SO LONG AS IT CONTINUES TO BE ONLY A HYPOTHESIS HAVE YOU AT LEAST SOME IDEA AS TO WHO THE MURDERER IS NO MONSIEUR I DON'T KNOW WHO THE MURDERER IS
3008-164327-0018 I SHALL KNOW I COULD NOT BUT OBSERVE THAT MONSIEUR DARZAC WAS DEEPLY MOVED
3008-164327-0019 WHY I ASKED MYSELF IF HE WAS REALLY AFRAID THAT THE MURDERER SHOULD BE DISCOVERED WAS HE HELPING THE REPORTER TO FIND HIM MY YOUNG FRIEND SEEMED TO HAVE RECEIVED THE SAME IMPRESSION FOR HE SAID BLUNTLY MONSIEUR DARZAC
3008-164327-0020 DON'T YOU WANT ME TO FIND OUT WHO THE MURDERER WAS OH I SHOULD LIKE TO KILL HIM WITH MY OWN HAND CRIED MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S FIANCE WITH A VEHEMENCE THAT AMAZED ME I BELIEVE YOU SAID ROULETABILLE GRAVELY
3008-164327-0021 BUT YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY QUESTION WE WERE PASSING BY THE THICKET OF WHICH THE YOUNG REPORTER HAD SPOKEN TO US A MINUTE BEFORE I ENTERED IT AND POINTED OUT EVIDENT TRACES OF A MAN WHO HAD BEEN HIDDEN THERE
3008-164327-0022 WAS RIGHT YES YES HE SAID WE HAVE TO DO WITH A THING OF FLESH AND BLOOD WHO USES THE SAME MEANS THAT WE DO IT'LL ALL COME OUT ON THOSE LINES HAVING SAID THIS HE ASKED ME FOR THE PAPER PATTERN OF THE FOOTPRINT WHICH HE HAD GIVEN ME TO TAKE CARE OF
3008-164327-0023 AND APPLIED IT TO A VERY CLEAR FOOTMARK BEHIND THE THICKET AHA HE SAID RISING I THOUGHT HE WAS NOW GOING TO TRACE BACK THE TRACK OF THE MURDERER'S FOOTMARKS TO THE VESTIBULE WINDOW BUT HE LED US INSTEAD FAR TO THE LEFT SAYING THAT IT WAS USELESS FERRETING IN THE MUD
3008-164327-0024 AND THAT HE WAS SURE NOW OF THE ROAD TAKEN BY THE MURDERER HE WENT ALONG THE WALL TO THE HEDGE AND DRY DITCH OVER WHICH HE JUMPED SEE JUST IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE PATH LEADING TO THE LAKE THAT WAS HIS NEAREST WAY TO GET OUT HOW DO YOU KNOW HE WENT TO THE LAKE
3008-164327-0025 BECAUSE FREDERIC LARSAN HAS NOT QUITTED THE BORDERS OF IT SINCE THIS MORNING THERE MUST BE SOME IMPORTANT MARKS THERE A FEW MINUTES LATER WE REACHED THE LAKE IT WAS A LITTLE SHEET OF MARSHY WATER SURROUNDED BY REEDS
3008-164327-0026 ON WHICH FLOATED SOME DEAD WATER LILY LEAVES THE GREAT FRED MAY HAVE SEEN US APPROACHING BUT WE PROBABLY INTERESTED HIM VERY LITTLE FOR HE TOOK HARDLY ANY NOTICE OF US AND CONTINUED TO BE STIRRING WITH HIS CANE SOMETHING WHICH WE COULD NOT SEE LOOK
3008-164327-0027 SAID ROULETABILLE HERE AGAIN ARE THE FOOTMARKS OF THE ESCAPING MAN THEY SKIRT THE LAKE HERE AND FINALLY DISAPPEAR JUST BEFORE THIS PATH WHICH LEADS TO THE HIGH ROAD TO EPINAY THE MAN CONTINUED HIS FLIGHT TO PARIS
3008-164327-0028 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT I ASKED SINCE THESE FOOTMARKS ARE NOT CONTINUED ON THE PATH WHAT MAKES ME THINK THAT WHY THESE FOOTPRINTS WHICH I EXPECTED TO FIND HE CRIED POINTING TO THE SHARPLY OUTLINED IMPRINT OF A NEAT BOOT SEE
3008-164327-0029 AND HE CALLED TO FREDERIC LARSAN MONSIEUR FRED THESE NEAT FOOTPRINTS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE THE DISCOVERY OF THE CRIME YES YOUNG MAN YES THEY HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY MADE REPLIED FRED WITHOUT RAISING HIS HEAD
3008-164327-0030 YOU SEE THERE ARE STEPS THAT COME AND STEPS THAT GO BACK AND THE MAN HAD A BICYCLE CRIED THE REPORTER HERE AFTER LOOKING AT THE MARKS OF THE BICYCLE WHICH FOLLOWED GOING AND COMING THE NEAT FOOTPRINTS I THOUGHT I MIGHT INTERVENE
3008-164327-0031 THE BICYCLE EXPLAINS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MURDERER'S BIG FOOT PRINTS I SAID THE MURDERER WITH HIS ROUGH BOOTS MOUNTED A BICYCLE HIS ACCOMPLICE THE WEARER OF THE NEAT BOOTS HAD COME TO WAIT FOR HIM ON THE EDGE OF THE LAKE WITH THE BICYCLE
3008-164327-0032 IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE MURDERER WAS WORKING FOR THE OTHER NO NO REPLIED ROULETABILLE WITH A STRANGE SMILE I HAVE EXPECTED TO FIND THESE FOOTMARKS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THESE ARE NOT THE FOOTMARKS OF THE MURDERER THEN THERE WERE TWO
3008-164327-0033 NO THERE WAS BUT ONE AND HE HAD NO ACCOMPLICE VERY GOOD VERY GOOD CRIED FREDERIC LARSAN LOOK CONTINUED THE YOUNG REPORTER SHOWING US THE GROUND WHERE IT HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY BIG AND HEAVY HEELS
3008-164327-0034 THE MAN SEATED HIMSELF THERE AND TOOK OFF HIS HOBNAILED BOOTS WHICH HE HAD WORN ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MISLEADING DETECTION AND THEN NO DOUBT TAKING THEM AWAY WITH HIM HE STOOD UP IN HIS OWN BOOTS AND QUIETLY AND SLOWLY REGAINED THE HIGH ROAD
3008-164327-0035 HOLDING HIS BICYCLE IN HIS HAND FOR HE COULD NOT VENTURE TO RIDE IT ON THIS ROUGH PATH THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE LIGHTNESS OF THE IMPRESSION MADE BY THE WHEELS ALONG IT IN SPITE OF THE SOFTNESS OF THE GROUND IF THERE HAD BEEN A MAN ON THE BICYCLE
3008-164327-0036 NO NO THERE WAS BUT ONE MAN THERE THE MURDERER ON FOOT BRAVO BRAVO CRIED FRED AGAIN AND COMING SUDDENLY TOWARDS US AND PLANTING HIMSELF IN FRONT OF MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC HE SAID TO HIM
3008-164327-0037 IF WE HAD A BICYCLE HERE WE MIGHT DEMONSTRATE THE CORRECTNESS OF THE YOUNG MAN'S REASONING MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC
3008-164327-0038 NO REPLIED MONSIEUR DARZAC THERE IS NOT I TOOK MINE FOUR DAYS AGO TO PARIS THE LAST TIME I CAME TO THE CHATEAU BEFORE THE CRIME THAT'S A PITY REPLIED FRED VERY COLDLY
3008-164327-0039 IF WE GO ON AT THIS RATE WE'LL BOTH COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION HAVE YOU ANY IDEA AS TO HOW THE MURDERER GOT AWAY FROM THE YELLOW ROOM YES SAID MY YOUNG FRIEND I HAVE AN IDEA
3008-164327-0040 AND IT MUST BE THE SAME AS YOURS THERE ARE NO TWO WAYS OF REASONING IN THIS AFFAIR
3008-164327-0041 YES THIS AFTERNOON HE IS GOING TO SUMMON BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE IN THE LABORATORY ALL THOSE WHO HAVE PLAYED ANY PART IN THIS TRAGEDY IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING IT IS A PITY YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO BE PRESENT I SHALL BE PRESENT
3008-164327-0042 SAID ROULETABILLE CONFIDENTLY REALLY YOU ARE AN EXTRAORDINARY FELLOW FOR YOUR AGE REPLIED THE DETECTIVE IN A TONE NOT WHOLLY FREE FROM IRONY YOU'D MAKE A WONDERFUL DETECTIVE
3008-164327-0043 IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE METHOD IF YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS AND THAT BUMP ON YOUR FOREHEAD
3008-164327-0044 WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE HANDKERCHIEF FULL OF BLOOD AND THE RED MARK OF THE HAND ON THE WALL YOU HAVE SEEN THE STAIN ON THE WALL BUT I HAVE ONLY SEEN THE HANDKERCHIEF BAH CRIED ROULETABILLE THE MURDERER WAS WOUNDED IN THE HAND BY MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S REVOLVER AH
3008-164327-0045 A SIMPLY INSTINCTIVE OBSERVATION TAKE CARE
3008-164327-0046 IF YOU USE IT INDISCRIMINATELY YOU ARE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY THAT MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON FIRED HER REVOLVER BUT YOU ARE WRONG WHEN YOU SAY THAT SHE WOUNDED THE MURDERER IN THE HAND I AM SURE OF IT
3008-164327-0047 FRED IMPERTURBABLE INTERRUPTED HIM DEFECTIVE OBSERVATION DEFECTIVE OBSERVATION THE EXAMINATION OF THE HANDKERCHIEF THE NUMBERLESS LITTLE ROUND SCARLET STAINS THE IMPRESSION OF DROPS WHICH I FOUND IN THE TRACKS OF THE FOOTPRINTS AT THE MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE MADE ON THE FLOOR
3008-164327-0048 PROVE TO ME THAT THE MURDERER WAS NOT WOUNDED AT ALL
3008-164327-0049 THE GREAT FRED SPOKE QUITE SERIOUSLY HOWEVER I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM UTTERING AN EXCLAMATION THE REPORTER LOOKED GRAVELY AT FRED WHO LOOKED GRAVELY AT HIM AND FRED IMMEDIATELY CONCLUDED
3008-164327-0050 THE MAN ALLOWED THE BLOOD TO FLOW INTO HIS HAND AND HANDKERCHIEF AND DRIED HIS HAND ON THE WALL THE FACT IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT HE ADDED BECAUSE THERE IS NO NEED OF HIS BEING WOUNDED IN THE HAND FOR HIM TO BE THE MURDERER
3008-164327-0051 AFTER A MOMENT HE SAID THERE IS SOMETHING A SOMETHING
3008-164327-0052 IN PERFECT GOOD FAITH TWIST LOGIC TO THE NECESSITIES OF THEIR PRECONCEIVED IDEAS YOU ALREADY HAVE YOUR IDEA ABOUT THE MURDERER MONSIEUR FRED DON'T DENY IT AND YOUR THEORY DEMANDS THAT THE MURDERER SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WOUNDED IN THE HAND
3008-164327-0053 OTHERWISE IT COMES TO NOTHING AND YOU HAVE SEARCHED
3008-164327-0054 IT'S DANGEROUS VERY DANGEROUS MONSIEUR FRED TO GO FROM A PRECONCEIVED IDEA TO FIND THE PROOFS TO FIT IT THAT METHOD MAY LEAD YOU FAR ASTRAY BEWARE OF JUDICIAL ERROR MONSIEUR FRED IT WILL TRIP YOU UP
3008-164327-0055 AND LAUGHING A LITTLE IN A SLIGHTLY BANTERING TONE HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
3008-164327-0056 FREDERIC LARSAN SILENTLY CONTEMPLATED THE YOUNG REPORTER WHO PRETENDED TO BE AS WISE AS HIMSELF SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS HE BOWED TO US AND MOVED QUICKLY AWAY HITTING THE STONES ON HIS PATH WITH HIS STOUT CANE
3008-164327-0057 ROULETABILLE WATCHED HIS RETREAT AND THEN TURNED TOWARD US HIS FACE JOYOUS AND TRIUMPHANT I SHALL BEAT HIM HE CRIED I SHALL BEAT THE GREAT FRED CLEVER AS HE IS I SHALL BEAT THEM ALL AND HE DANCED A DOUBLE SHUFFLE SUDDENLY HE STOPPED
3008-164327-0058 MY EYES FOLLOWED HIS GAZE THEY WERE FIXED ON MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC WHO WAS LOOKING ANXIOUSLY AT THE IMPRESSION LEFT BY HIS FEET SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE ELEGANT FOOTMARKS THERE WAS NOT A PARTICLE OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM WE THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO FAINT
3008-164327-0059 AND NOW DESPAIRING FACE AT LENGTH REGAINING HIS SELF POSSESSION HE BOWED TO US AND REMARKING IN A CHANGED VOICE THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO RETURN TO THE CHATEAU
3008-164327-0060 HE ALSO APPEARED TO BE DEEPLY CONCERNED FROM HIS POCKET BOOK HE TOOK A PIECE OF WHITE PAPER AS I HAD SEEN HIM DO BEFORE AND WITH HIS SCISSORS CUT OUT THE SHAPE OF THE NEAT BOOTMARKS THAT WERE ON THE GROUND
3008-164327-0061 THEN HE FITTED THE NEW PAPER PATTERN WITH THE ONE HE HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE THE TWO WERE EXACTLY ALIKE
3008-164327-0062 THE DEUCE PRESENTLY HE ADDED YET I BELIEVE MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC TO BE AN HONEST MAN HE THEN LED ME ON THE ROAD TO THE DONJON INN WHICH WE COULD SEE ON THE HIGHWAY
3008-164328-0000 WE SHALL HAVE TO EAT RED MEAT NOW THE DONJON INN WAS OF NO IMPOSING APPEARANCE BUT I LIKE THESE BUILDINGS WITH THEIR RAFTERS BLACKENED WITH AGE AND THE SMOKE OF THEIR HEARTHS THESE INNS OF THE COACHING DAYS CRUMBLING ERECTIONS THAT WILL SOON EXIST IN THE MEMORY ONLY
3008-164328-0001 THEY BELONG TO THE BYGONE DAYS THEY ARE LINKED WITH HISTORY THEY MAKE US THINK OF THE ROAD OF THOSE DAYS WHEN HIGHWAYMEN RODE I SAW AT ONCE THAT THE DONJON INN WAS AT LEAST TWO CENTURIES OLD PERHAPS OLDER
3008-164328-0002 UNDER ITS SIGN BOARD OVER THE THRESHOLD A MAN WITH A CRABBED LOOKING FACE WAS STANDING SEEMINGLY PLUNGED IN UNPLEASANT THOUGHT IF THE WRINKLES ON HIS FOREHEAD AND THE KNITTING OF HIS BROWS WERE ANY INDICATION
3008-164328-0003 AS WE EXPRESSED A HOPE THAT HE WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH TO FURNISH US WITH A BREAKFAST HE ASSURED US THAT HE HAD NO PROVISIONS REGARDING US AS HE SAID THIS WITH A LOOK THAT WAS UNMISTAKABLY SUSPICIOUS
3008-164328-0004 WE ARE NOT POLICEMEN I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE POLICE I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYONE REPLIED THE MAN I HAD MADE MY FRIEND UNDERSTAND BY A SIGN THAT WE SHOULD DO BETTER NOT TO INSIST BUT BEING DETERMINED TO ENTER THE INN
3008-164328-0005 HE SLIPPED BY THE MAN ON THE DOORSTEP AND WAS IN THE COMMON ROOM COME ON HE SAID IT IS VERY COMFORTABLE HERE A GOOD FIRE WAS BLAZING IN THE CHIMNEY AND WE HELD OUR HANDS TO THE WARMTH IT SENT OUT
3008-164328-0006 IT WAS A MORNING IN WHICH THE APPROACH OF WINTER WAS UNMISTAKABLE THE ROOM WAS A TOLERABLY LARGE ONE FURNISHED WITH TWO HEAVY TABLES SOME STOOLS A COUNTER DECORATED WITH ROWS OF BOTTLES OF SYRUP AND ALCOHOL
3008-164328-0007 THREE WINDOWS LOOKED OUT ON TO THE ROAD A COLOURED ADVERTISEMENT LAUDED THE MANY MERITS OF A NEW VERMOUTH ON THE MANTELPIECE WAS ARRAYED THE INNKEEPER'S COLLECTION OF FIGURED EARTHENWARE POTS AND STONE JUGS
3008-164328-0008 THAT'S A FINE FIRE FOR ROASTING A CHICKEN SAID ROULETABILLE WE HAVE NO CHICKEN NOT EVEN A WRETCHED RABBIT SAID THE LANDLORD I KNOW SAID MY FRIEND SLOWLY I KNOW
3008-164328-0009 WE SHALL HAVE TO EAT RED MEAT NOW I CONFESS I DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT ROULETABILLE MEANT BY WHAT HE HAD SAID BUT THE LANDLORD AS SOON AS HE HEARD THE WORDS UTTERED AN OATH
3008-164328-0010 WHICH HE AT ONCE STIFLED AND PLACED HIMSELF AT OUR ORDERS AS OBEDIENTLY AS MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC HAD DONE
3008-164328-0011 THE PRESBYTERY HAS LOST NOTHING OF ITS CHARM NOR THE GARDEN ITS BRIGHTNESS CERTAINLY MY FRIEND KNEW HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HIM BY THE USE OF WHOLLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE PHRASES I OBSERVED AS MUCH TO HIM
3008-164328-0012 BUT HE MERELY SMILED I SHOULD HAVE PROPOSED THAT HE GIVE ME SOME EXPLANATION BUT HE PUT A FINGER TO HIS LIPS WHICH EVIDENTLY SIGNIFIED THAT HE HAD NOT ONLY DETERMINED NOT TO SPEAK BUT ALSO ENJOINED SILENCE ON MY PART
3008-164328-0013 MEANTIME THE MAN HAD PUSHED OPEN A LITTLE SIDE DOOR AND CALLED TO SOMEBODY TO BRING HIM HALF A DOZEN EGGS AND A PIECE OF BEEFSTEAK THE COMMISSION WAS QUICKLY EXECUTED BY A STRONGLY BUILT YOUNG WOMAN WITH BEAUTIFUL BLONDE HAIR AND LARGE HANDSOME EYES
3008-164328-0014 WHO REGARDED US WITH CURIOSITY THE INNKEEPER SAID TO HER ROUGHLY GET OUT AND IF THE GREEN MAN COMES DON'T LET ME SEE HIM SHE DISAPPEARED
3008-164328-0015 AND THE MEAT WHICH WAS ON A DISH PLACED ALL CAREFULLY BESIDE HIM IN THE CHIMNEY UNHOOKED A FRYING PAN AND A GRIDIRON AND BEGAN TO BEAT UP OUR OMELETTE BEFORE PROCEEDING TO GRILL OUR BEEFSTEAK HE THEN ORDERED TWO BOTTLES OF CIDER
3008-164328-0016 AND SEEMED TO TAKE AS LITTLE NOTICE OF OUR HOST AS OUR HOST DID OF HIM THE LANDLORD LET US DO OUR OWN COOKING AND SET OUR TABLE NEAR ONE OF THE WINDOWS SUDDENLY I HEARD HIM MUTTER AH THERE HE IS
3008-164328-0017 HIS FACE HAD CHANGED EXPRESSING FIERCE HATRED HE WENT AND GLUED HIMSELF TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS WATCHING THE ROAD
3008-164328-0018 HE HAD ALREADY LEFT OUR OMELETTE AND HAD JOINED THE LANDLORD AT THE WINDOW I WENT WITH HIM A MAN DRESSED ENTIRELY IN GREEN VELVET HIS HEAD COVERED WITH A HUNTSMAN'S CAP OF THE SAME COLOUR WAS ADVANCING LEISURELY LIGHTING A PIPE AS HE WALKED
3008-164328-0019 HE CARRIED A FOWLING PIECE SLUNG AT HIS BACK HIS MOVEMENTS DISPLAYED AN ALMOST ARISTOCRATIC EASE HE WORE EYE GLASSES AND APPEARED TO BE ABOUT FIVE AND FORTY YEARS OF AGE HIS HAIR AS WELL AS HIS MOUSTACHE WERE SALT GREY
3008-164328-0020 HE WAS REMARKABLY HANDSOME AS HE PASSED NEAR THE INN HE HESITATED AS IF ASKING HIMSELF WHETHER OR NO HE SHOULD ENTER IT GAVE A GLANCE TOWARDS US TOOK A FEW WHIFFS AT HIS PIPE AND THEN RESUMED HIS WALK AT THE SAME NONCHALANT PACE
3008-164328-0021 THE GREEN MAN GROWLED THE INNKEEPER DON'T YOU KNOW HIM THEN ALL THE BETTER FOR YOU HE IS NOT AN ACQUAINTANCE TO MAKE WELL HE IS MONSIEUR STANGERSON'S FOREST KEEPER
3008-164328-0023 A KEEPER IS AS MUCH A SERVANT AS ANY OTHER ISN'T HE UPON MY WORD
3008-164328-0024 AND THAT ALL THE LAND AND WOODS BELONG TO HIM HE'LL NOT LET A POOR CREATURE EAT A MORSEL OF BREAD ON THE GRASS HIS GRASS DOES HE OFTEN COME HERE TOO OFTEN BUT I'VE MADE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT HIS FACE DOESN'T PLEASE ME
3008-164328-0025 AND FOR A MONTH PAST HE HASN'T BEEN HERE THE DONJON INN HAS NEVER EXISTED FOR HIM HE HASN'T HAD TIME
3008-164328-0026 WHY THE CONCIERGES OF THE CHATEAU WOULD TURN THEIR EYES AWAY FROM A PICTURE OF HIM THE CONCIERGES OF THE CHATEAU ARE HONEST PEOPLE THEN YES THEY ARE AS TRUE AS MY NAME'S MATHIEU MONSIEUR I BELIEVE THEM TO BE HONEST YET THEY'VE BEEN ARRESTED WHAT DOES THAT PROVE
3008-164328-0027 AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE MURDER OF THE MURDER OF POOR MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON A GOOD GIRL MUCH LOVED EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF IT AND MANY THINGS BESIDES BUT THAT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS NOT EVEN MINE
3008-164328-0028 THE INNKEEPER LOOKED AT HIM SIDEWAYS AND SAID GRUFFLY NOT EVEN YOURS THE OMELETTE READY WE SAT DOWN AT TABLE AND WERE SILENTLY EATING WHEN THE DOOR WAS PUSHED OPEN AND AN OLD WOMAN DRESSED IN RAGS LEANING ON A STICK
3008-164328-0029 HER HEAD DODDERING HER WHITE HAIR HANGING LOOSELY OVER HER WRINKLED FOREHEAD APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD AH THERE YOU ARE MOTHER ANGENOUX IT'S LONG SINCE WE SAW YOU LAST SAID OUR HOST
3008-164328-0030 VERY ILL VERY NEARLY DYING SAID THE OLD WOMAN
3008-164328-0031 AND SHE ENTERED FOLLOWED BY A CAT LARGER THAN ANY I HAD EVER BELIEVED COULD EXIST THE BEAST LOOKED AT US
3008-164328-0032 I HAD NEVER HEARD SO LUGUBRIOUS A CRY AS IF DRAWN BY THE CAT'S CRY A MAN FOLLOWED THE OLD WOMAN IN IT WAS THE GREEN MAN HE SALUTED BY RAISING HIS HAND TO HIS CAP AND SEATED HIMSELF AT A TABLE NEAR TO OURS
3008-164328-0033 A GLASS OF CIDER DADDY MATHIEU HE SAID AS THE GREEN MAN ENTERED DADDY MATHIEU HAD STARTED VIOLENTLY BUT VISIBLY MASTERING HIMSELF HE SAID I'VE NO MORE CIDER I SERVED THE LAST BOTTLES TO THESE GENTLEMEN
3008-164328-0034 THEN GIVE ME A GLASS OF WHITE WINE SAID THE GREEN MAN WITHOUT SHOWING THE LEAST SURPRISE I'VE NO MORE WHITE WINE NO MORE ANYTHING SAID DADDY MATHIEU SURLILY HOW IS MADAME MATHIEU QUITE WELL THANK YOU
3008-164328-0035 SO THE YOUNG WOMAN WITH THE LARGE TENDER EYES WHOM WE HAD JUST SEEN WAS THE WIFE OF THIS REPUGNANT AND BRUTAL RUSTIC WHOSE JEALOUSY SEEMED TO EMPHASISE HIS PHYSICAL UGLINESS SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM THE INNKEEPER LEFT THE ROOM
3008-164328-0036 THE CAT AT HER FEET YOU'VE BEEN ILL MOTHER ANGENOUX IS THAT WHY WE HAVE NOT SEEN YOU FOR THE LAST WEEK ASKED THE GREEN MAN
3008-164328-0037 I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET UP BUT THREE TIMES
3008-164328-0038 OUR GOOD PATRONESS AND THE REST OF THE TIME I HAVE BEEN LYING ON MY BED THERE WAS NO ONE TO CARE FOR ME BUT THE BETE DU BON DIEU DID SHE NOT LEAVE YOU NEITHER BY DAY NOR BY NIGHT
3008-164328-0039 ARE YOU SURE OF THAT AS I AM OF PARADISE THEN HOW WAS IT MADAME ANGENOUX THAT ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER NOTHING BUT THE CRY OF THE BETE DU BON DIEU WAS HEARD
3008-164328-0040 I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID BUT SHALL I TELL YOU SOMETHING THERE ARE NO TWO CATS IN THE WORLD THAT CRY LIKE THAT WELL ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER I ALSO HEARD THE CRY OF THE BETE DU BON DIEU OUTSIDE
3008-164328-0041 AND YET SHE WAS ON MY KNEES AND DID NOT MEW ONCE I SWEAR I CROSSED MYSELF WHEN I HEARD THAT AS IF I HAD HEARD THE DEVIL I LOOKED AT THE KEEPER WHEN HE PUT THE LAST QUESTION
3008-164328-0042 AND I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF I DID NOT DETECT AN EVIL SMILE ON HIS LIPS AT THAT MOMENT THE NOISE OF LOUD QUARRELLING REACHED US WE EVEN THOUGHT WE HEARD A DULL SOUND OF BLOWS AS IF SOME ONE WAS BEING BEATEN
3008-164328-0043 THE GREEN MAN QUICKLY ROSE AND HURRIED TO THE DOOR BY THE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE BUT IT WAS OPENED BY THE LANDLORD WHO APPEARED AND SAID TO THE KEEPER DON'T ALARM YOURSELF MONSIEUR IT IS MY WIFE SHE HAS THE TOOTHACHE AND HE LAUGHED
3008-164328-0044 HE HELD OUT A PACKET TO THE OLD WOMAN WHO TOOK IT EAGERLY AND WENT OUT BY THE DOOR CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY HER CAT THEN YOU WON'T SERVE ME ASKED THE GREEN MAN DADDY MATHIEU'S FACE WAS PLACID AND NO LONGER RETAINED ITS EXPRESSION OF HATRED
3008-164328-0045 I'VE NOTHING FOR YOU NOTHING FOR YOU TAKE YOURSELF OFF THE GREEN MAN QUIETLY REFILLED HIS PIPE LIT IT BOWED TO US AND WENT OUT
3008-164328-0046 NO SOONER WAS HE OVER THE THRESHOLD THAN DADDY MATHIEU SLAMMED THE DOOR AFTER HIM AND TURNING TOWARDS US WITH EYES BLOODSHOT AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH HE HISSED TO US SHAKING HIS CLENCHED FIST AT THE DOOR HE HAD JUST SHUT ON THE MAN HE EVIDENTLY HATED
3008-164328-0047 I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE WHO TELL ME WE SHALL HAVE TO EAT RED MEAT NOW BUT IF IT WILL INTEREST YOU TO KNOW IT THAT MAN IS THE MURDERER WITH WHICH WORDS DADDY MATHIEU IMMEDIATELY LEFT US
3008-164328-0048 ROULETABILLE RETURNED TOWARDS THE FIREPLACE AND SAID NOW WE'LL GRILL OUR STEAK
3008-164328-0049 WE SAW NO MORE OF DADDY MATHIEU THAT DAY AND ABSOLUTE SILENCE REIGNED IN THE INN WHEN WE LEFT IT AFTER PLACING FIVE FRANCS ON THE TABLE IN PAYMENT FOR OUR FEAST
3008-164328-0050 ROULETABILLE AT ONCE SET OFF ON A THREE MILE WALK ROUND PROFESSOR STANGERSON'S ESTATE HE HALTED FOR SOME TEN MINUTES AT THE CORNER OF A NARROW ROAD BLACK WITH SOOT
3008-164328-0051 WHICH TOUCHES ON THE ROAD FROM EPINAY TO CORBEIL TO TELL ME THAT THE MURDERER HAD CERTAINLY PASSED THAT WAY BEFORE ENTERING THE GROUNDS AND CONCEALING HIMSELF IN THE LITTLE CLUMP OF TREES YOU DON'T THINK THEN THAT THE KEEPER KNOWS ANYTHING OF IT I ASKED
3008-164328-0052 WE SHALL SEE THAT LATER HE REPLIED FOR THE PRESENT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT THE LANDLORD SAID ABOUT THE MAN THE LANDLORD HATES HIM I DIDN'T TAKE YOU TO BREAKFAST AT THE DONJON INN FOR THE SAKE OF THE GREEN MAN
3008-164328-0053 FOLLOWED BY ME TOWARDS THE LITTLE BUILDING WHICH STANDING NEAR THE PARK GATE
3008-164328-0054 WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED THAT MORNING WITH THE SKILL OF AN ACROBAT HE GOT INTO THE LODGE BY AN UPPER WINDOW WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN AND RETURNED TEN MINUTES LATER HE SAID ONLY AH A WORD WHICH IN HIS MOUTH
3008-164328-0055 SIGNIFIED MANY THINGS WE WERE ABOUT TO TAKE THE ROAD LEADING TO THE CHATEAU WHEN A CONSIDERABLE STIR AT THE PARK GATE ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION
3008-164328-0056 AND WHETHER HE IS SO MUCH CLEVERER THAN ANYBODY ELSE
3008-164328-0057 WHO WERE ALSO DESIROUS OF ENTERING THE PARK BUT TWO GENDARMES STATIONED AT THE GATE HAD EVIDENTLY RECEIVED ORDERS TO REFUSE ADMISSION TO ANYBODY
3009-10327-0000 QUESTION FIFTY
3009-10327-0001 FIRSTLY THE PURELY SPIRITUAL CREATURE WHICH IN HOLY SCRIPTURE IS CALLED ANGEL SECONDLY THE CREATURE WHOLLY CORPOREAL THIRDLY THE COMPOSITE CREATURE CORPOREAL AND SPIRITUAL WHICH IS MAN
3009-10327-0002 CONCERNING THE ANGELS WE CONSIDER FIRST WHAT BELONGS TO THEIR SUBSTANCE SECONDLY WHAT BELONGS TO THEIR INTELLECT THIRDLY WHAT BELONGS TO THEIR WILL FOURTHLY WHAT BELONGS TO THEIR CREATION
3009-10327-0003 THEIR SUBSTANCE WE CONSIDER ABSOLUTELY AND IN RELATION TO CORPOREAL THINGS CONCERNING THEIR SUBSTANCE ABSOLUTELY CONSIDERED
3009-10327-0004 IT WOULD SEEM THAT AN ANGEL IS NOT ENTIRELY INCORPOREAL FOR WHAT IS INCORPOREAL ONLY AS REGARDS OURSELVES AND NOT
3009-10327-0005 THEREFORE EVERY CREATURE IS CORPOREAL NOW ANGELS ARE GOD'S CREATURES AS APPEARS
3009-10327-0006 HE COMMANDED AND THEY WERE CREATED THEREFORE ANGELS ARE CORPOREAL
3009-10327-0007 I ANSWER THAT THERE MUST BE SOME INCORPOREAL CREATURES FOR WHAT IS PRINCIPALLY INTENDED BY GOD IN CREATURES IS GOOD AND THIS CONSISTS IN ASSIMILATION TO GOD HIMSELF
3009-10327-0008 AND THE PERFECT ASSIMILATION OF AN EFFECT TO A CAUSE IS ACCOMPLISHED WHEN THE EFFECT IMITATES THE CAUSE ACCORDING TO THAT WHEREBY THE CAUSE
3009-10327-0009 CANNOT BE THE ACTION OF A BODY NOR OF ANY CORPOREAL FACULTY FOR EVERY BODY IS LIMITED TO HERE AND NOW HENCE THE PERFECTION OF THE UNIVERSE REQUIRES THE EXISTENCE OF AN INCORPOREAL CREATURE
3009-10327-0010 THE ANCIENTS HOWEVER NOT PROPERLY REALIZING THE FORCE OF INTELLIGENCE AND FAILING TO MAKE A PROPER DISTINCTION BETWEEN SENSE AND INTELLECT THOUGHT THAT NOTHING EXISTED IN THE WORLD BUT WHAT COULD BE APPREHENDED BY SENSE
3009-10327-0011 SEEMS TO BE COLD AND THUS IT IS SAID THAT ANGELS COMPARED TO GOD ARE MATERIAL AND CORPOREAL NOT HOWEVER AS IF ANYTHING CORPOREAL EXISTED IN THEM
3009-10327-0012 MOVEMENT IS THERE TAKEN IN THE SENSE IN WHICH IT IS APPLIED TO INTELLIGENCE AND WILL THEREFORE AN ANGEL IS CALLED AN EVER MOBILE SUBSTANCE BECAUSE HE IS EVER ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT
3009-10327-0013 AND NOT AS IF HE WERE SOMETIMES ACTUALLY AND SOMETIMES POTENTIALLY AS WE ARE HENCE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE OBJECTION RESTS ON AN EQUIVOCATION
3009-10327-0014 TO BE CIRCUMSCRIBED BY LOCAL LIMITS BELONGS TO BODIES ONLY WHEREAS TO BE CIRCUMSCRIBED BY ESSENTIAL LIMITS BELONGS TO ALL CREATURES
3009-10327-0016 AND THE ABOVE PROPERTIES ARE FOUND IN THE ANGEL THEREFORE AN ANGEL IS COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM
3009-10327-0017 FORM IS ACT SO WHAT IS FORM ONLY IS PURE ACT BUT AN ANGEL IS NOT PURE ACT FOR THIS BELONGS TO GOD ALONE THEREFORE AN ANGEL IS NOT FORM ONLY
3009-10327-0018 BUT HAS A FORM IN MATTER
3009-10327-0019 FORM IS PROPERLY LIMITED AND PERFECTED BY MATTER SO THE FORM WHICH IS NOT IN MATTER IS AN INFINITE FORM BUT THE FORM OF AN ANGEL IS NOT INFINITE FOR EVERY CREATURE IS FINITE
3009-10327-0020 THEREFORE THE FORM OF AN ANGEL IS IN MATTER
3009-10327-0021 TO BE AS IMMATERIAL AS THEY ARE INCORPOREAL I ANSWER THAT SOME ASSERT THAT THE ANGELS ARE COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM
3009-10327-0022 IN HIS BOOK OF THE FOUNT OF LIFE FOR HE SUPPOSES THAT WHATEVER THINGS ARE DISTINGUISHED BY THE INTELLECT ARE REALLY DISTINCT NOW AS REGARDS INCORPOREAL SUBSTANCE
3009-10327-0023 THE INTELLECT APPREHENDS THAT WHICH DISTINGUISHES IT FROM CORPOREAL SUBSTANCE AND THAT WHICH IT HAS IN COMMON WITH IT HENCE HE CONCLUDES THAT WHAT DISTINGUISHES INCORPOREAL FROM CORPOREAL SUBSTANCE IS A KIND OF FORM TO IT
3009-10327-0024 AND WHATEVER IS SUBJECT TO THIS DISTINGUISHING FORM AS IT WERE SOMETHING COMMON IS ITS MATTER THEREFORE HE ASSERTS THE UNIVERSAL MATTER OF SPIRITUAL AND CORPOREAL THINGS IS THE SAME SO THAT IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT
3009-10327-0025 THE FORM OF INCORPOREAL SUBSTANCE IS IMPRESSED IN THE MATTER OF SPIRITUAL THINGS IN THE SAME WAY AS THE FORM OF QUANTITY IS IMPRESSED IN THE MATTER OF CORPOREAL THINGS BUT ONE GLANCE IS ENOUGH TO SHOW
3009-10327-0026 THAT THERE CANNOT BE ONE MATTER OF SPIRITUAL AND OF CORPOREAL THINGS FOR IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT A SPIRITUAL AND A CORPOREAL FORM SHOULD BE RECEIVED INTO THE SAME PART OF MATTER OTHERWISE ONE AND THE SAME THING
3009-10327-0027 WOULD BE CORPOREAL AND SPIRITUAL HENCE IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT ONE PART OF MATTER RECEIVES THE CORPOREAL FORM AND ANOTHER RECEIVES THE SPIRITUAL FORM MATTER HOWEVER IS NOT DIVISIBLE INTO PARTS
3009-10327-0028 IMPOSSIBLE FOR AN INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCE TO HAVE ANY KIND OF MATTER FOR THE OPERATION BELONGING TO ANYTHING IS ACCORDING TO THE MODE OF ITS SUBSTANCE NOW TO UNDERSTAND IS AN ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL
3009-10327-0029 OPERATION AS APPEARS FROM ITS OBJECT WHENCE ANY ACT RECEIVES ITS SPECIES AND NATURE FOR A THING IS UNDERSTOOD ACCORDING TO ITS DEGREE OF IMMATERIALITY BECAUSE FORMS THAT EXIST IN MATTER
3009-10327-0030 ARE INDIVIDUAL FORMS WHICH THE INTELLECT CANNOT APPREHEND AS SUCH HENCE IT MUST BE THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL SUBSTANCE IS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL
3009-10327-0031 BUT THINGS DISTINGUISHED BY THE INTELLECT ARE NOT NECESSARILY DISTINGUISHED IN REALITY BECAUSE THE INTELLECT DOES NOT APPREHEND THINGS ACCORDING TO THEIR MODE BUT ACCORDING TO ITS OWN MODE HENCE
3009-10327-0032 MATERIAL THINGS WHICH ARE BELOW OUR INTELLECT EXIST IN OUR INTELLECT IN A SIMPLER MODE THAN THEY EXIST IN THEMSELVES ANGELIC SUBSTANCES
3009-10327-0033 AND FROM THE FORMER THE DIFFERENCE WHEREAS IN IMMATERIAL THINGS THERE IS NO SEPARATE DETERMINATOR AND THING DETERMINED EACH THING BY ITS OWN SELF HOLDS A DETERMINATE GRADE IN BEING
3009-10327-0034 AND THEREFORE IN THEM GENUS AND DIFFERENCE ARE NOT DERIVED FROM DIFFERENT THINGS BUT FROM ONE AND THE SAME NEVERTHELESS THIS DIFFERS IN OUR MODE OF CONCEPTION FOR INASMUCH AS OUR INTELLECT CONSIDERS IT
3009-10327-0035 AS INDETERMINATE IT DERIVES THE IDEA OF THEIR GENUS AND INASMUCH AS IT CONSIDERS IT DETERMINATELY IT DERIVES THE IDEA OF THEIR DIFFERENCE REPLY
3009-10327-0036 THIS REASON IS GIVEN IN THE BOOK ON THE FOUNT OF LIFE AND IT WOULD BE COGENT SUPPOSING THAT THE RECEPTIVE MODE OF THE INTELLECT AND OF MATTER WERE THE SAME BUT THIS IS CLEARLY FALSE
3009-10327-0037 FOR MATTER RECEIVES THE FORM THAT THEREBY IT MAY BE CONSTITUTED IN SOME SPECIES EITHER OF AIR OR OF FIRE OR OF SOMETHING ELSE
3009-10327-0038 HENCE SUCH A WAY OF RECEIVING IS NOT THAT OF MATTER BUT OF AN IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCE
3009-10327-0039 ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO COMPOSITION OF MATTER AND FORM IN AN ANGEL YET THERE IS ACT AND POTENTIALITY AND THIS CAN BE MADE EVIDENT IF WE CONSIDER THE NATURE OF MATERIAL THINGS
3009-10327-0040 WHICH CONTAIN A TWOFOLD COMPOSITION THE FIRST IS THAT OF FORM AND MATTER WHEREBY THE NATURE IS CONSTITUTED SUCH A COMPOSITE NATURE IS NOT ITS OWN EXISTENCE BUT EXISTENCE IS ITS ACT
3009-10327-0041 HENCE THE NATURE ITSELF IS RELATED TO ITS OWN EXISTENCE AS POTENTIALITY TO ACT THEREFORE IF THERE BE NO MATTER AND SUPPOSING THAT THE FORM ITSELF SUBSISTS WITHOUT MATTER
3009-10327-0042 THERE NEVERTHELESS STILL REMAINS THE RELATION OF THE FORM TO ITS VERY EXISTENCE AS OF POTENTIALITY TO ACT AND SUCH A KIND OF COMPOSITION IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN THE ANGELS AND THIS IS WHAT SOME SAY
3009-10327-0043 THAT AN ANGEL IS COMPOSED OF WHEREBY HE IS AND WHAT IS OR EXISTENCE AND WHAT IS
3009-10327-0044 FOR WHAT IS IS THE FORM ITSELF SUBSISTING
3009-10327-0045 IS NOT ABSOLUTELY SUBSISTING BUT IS LIMITED TO SOME NATURE TO WHICH IT BELONGS BUT THERE IS NOTHING AGAINST A CREATURE BEING CONSIDERED RELATIVELY INFINITE MATERIAL CREATURES ARE INFINITE ON THE PART OF MATTER
3009-10327-0046 ARE NOT RECEIVED IN ANYTHING ELSE AS IF WE WERE TO SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT WHITENESS EXISTING SEPARATE IS INFINITE AS REGARDS THE NATURE OF WHITENESS FORASMUCH
3009-10327-0047 THE MORE A THING APPROACHES TO UNITY SO MUCH THE LESS IS IT MULTIPLIED AS IS EVIDENT IN NUMBERS BUT AMONG OTHER CREATED NATURES THE ANGELIC NATURE APPROACHES NEAREST TO GOD THEREFORE SINCE GOD IS SUPREMELY ONE
3009-10327-0048 IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS THE LEAST POSSIBLE NUMBER IN THE ANGELIC NATURE
3009-10327-0049 IN GREATER NUMBER THAN THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES
3009-10327-0050 SUBSIST BECAUSE OF THE RAYS OF THE DIVINE GOODNESS BUT A RAY IS ONLY MULTIPLIED ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT RECEIVE IT NOW IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THEIR MATTER IS RECEPTIVE OF AN INTELLIGIBLE RAY
3009-10327-0051 SINCE INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCES
3009-10327-0052 THAT THE MULTIPLICATION OF INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCES CAN ONLY BE ACCORDING TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FIRST BODIES THAT IS OF THE HEAVENLY ONES SO THAT IN SOME WAY THE SHEDDING FORM OF THE AFORESAID RAYS
3009-10327-0053 MAY BE TERMINATED IN THEM AND HENCE THE SAME CONCLUSION IS TO BE DRAWN AS BEFORE ON THE CONTRARY
3009-10327-0054 MINISTERED TO HIM AND TEN THOUSANDS TIMES A HUNDRED THOUSAND STOOD BEFORE HIM I ANSWER THAT THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS OPINIONS WITH REGARD TO THE NUMBER
3009-10327-0055 OF THE SEPARATE SUBSTANCES PLATO CONTENDED THAT THE SEPARATE SUBSTANCES ARE THE SPECIES OF SENSIBLE THINGS AS IF WE WERE TO MAINTAIN THAT HUMAN NATURE IS A SEPARATE SUBSTANCE OF ITSELF AND ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW
3009-10327-0056 IT WOULD HAVE TO BE MAINTAINED THAT THE NUMBER OF THE SEPARATE SUBSTANCES IS THE NUMBER
3009-10327-0057 TO THE CUSTOM OF THE SCRIPTURES FOR THE POWERS OF IRRATIONAL THINGS TO BE DESIGNATED AS ANGELS HENCE IT MUST BE SAID THAT THE ANGELS EVEN INASMUCH AS THEY ARE IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCES
3009-10327-0058 EXIST IN EXCEEDING GREAT NUMBER FAR BEYOND ALL MATERIAL MULTITUDE THIS
3009-10327-0059 THE MORE PERFECT SOME THINGS ARE IN SO MUCH GREATER AN EXCESS ARE THEY CREATED BY GOD NOW AS IN BODIES SUCH EXCESS IS OBSERVED IN REGARD TO THEIR MAGNITUDE SO IN THINGS INCORPOREAL
3009-10327-0060 IN REGARD TO THEIR MULTITUDE WE SEE IN FACT THAT INCORRUPTIBLE BODIES EXCEED CORRUPTIBLE BODIES ALMOST INCOMPARABLY IN MAGNITUDE FOR THE ENTIRE SPHERE OF THINGS ACTIVE AND PASSIVE
3009-10327-0061 IS SOMETHING VERY SMALL IN COMPARISON WITH THE HEAVENLY BODIES HENCE IT IS REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT THE IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCES AS IT WERE INCOMPARABLY EXCEED MATERIAL SUBSTANCES AS TO MULTITUDE
3009-10327-0062 IN THE ANGELS NUMBER IS NOT THAT OF DISCRETE QUANTITY BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIVISION OF WHAT IS CONTINUOUS
3009-10327-0063 HE WAS FORCED TO MAKE USE OF THIS ARGUMENT SINCE ONLY THROUGH SENSIBLE THINGS CAN WE COME TO KNOW
3009-10327-0064 NAMELY AS ONE IS SIMPLER THAN ANOTHER AND OF KEENER INTELLECT THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT DIFFER SPECIFICALLY
3009-10327-0065 THE MORE OUGHT IT TO BE MULTIPLIED BUT THIS WOULD NOT BE SO IF THERE WERE BUT ONE INDIVIDUAL UNDER ONE SPECIES
3009-10327-0066 THAT SOME HAVE SAID THAT ALL SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCES EVEN SOULS ARE OF THE ONE SPECIES OTHERS AGAIN THAT ALL THE ANGELS ARE OF THE ONE SPECIES BUT NOT SOULS WHILE OTHERS ALLEGE
3009-10327-0067 THAT ALL THE ANGELS OF ONE HIERARCHY OR EVEN OF ONE ORDER ARE OF THE ONE SPECIES BUT THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR SUCH THINGS AS AGREE IN SPECIES BUT DIFFER IN NUMBER AGREE IN FORM
3009-10327-0068 BUT ARE DISTINGUISHED MATERIALLY IF THEREFORE THE ANGELS
3009-10327-0069 FOR TWO ANGELS TO BE OF ONE SPECIES JUST AS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THERE TO BE SEVERAL WHITENESSES APART OR SEVERAL HUMANITIES SINCE WHITENESSES ARE NOT SEVERAL EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE IN SEVERAL SUBSTANCES
3009-10327-0070 AND IF THE ANGELS HAD MATTER NOT EVEN THEN COULD THERE BE SEVERAL ANGELS OF ONE SPECIES FOR IT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR MATTER TO BE THE PRINCIPLE OF DISTINCTION OF ONE FROM THE OTHER NOT INDEED ACCORDING TO THE DIVISION
3009-10327-0071 OF QUANTITY SINCE THEY ARE INCORPOREAL BUT ACCORDING TO THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR POWERS AND SUCH DIVERSITY OF MATTER CAUSES DIVERSITY NOT MERELY OF SPECIES BUT OF GENUS
3009-10327-0072 THAN THE UNDETERMINED AND THE PROPER THAN THE COMMON BUT NOT AS ONE NATURE IS NOBLER THAN ANOTHER OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE NECESSARY THAT ALL IRRATIONAL ANIMALS BE OF THE SAME SPECIES OR THAT THERE SHOULD BE IN THEM SOME FORM
3009-10327-0073 WHICH IS HIGHER THAN THE SENSIBLE SOUL THEREFORE IRRATIONAL ANIMALS DIFFER IN SPECIES ACCORDING TO THE VARIOUS DETERMINED DEGREES OF SENSITIVE NATURE AND IN LIKE MANNER ALL THE ANGELS DIFFER IN SPECIES ACCORDING
3009-10327-0074 TO THE DIVERSE DEGREES OF INTELLECTUAL NATURE
3009-10327-0075 MORE AND LESS CHANGE THE SPECIES NOT ACCORDING AS THEY ARE CAUSED BY THE INTENSITY OR REMISSNESS OF ONE FORM BUT ACCORDING AS THEY ARE CAUSED BY FORMS OF DIVERSE DEGREES FOR INSTANCE IF WE SAY THAT FIRE
3009-10327-0076 IS MORE PERFECT THAN AIR AND IN THIS WAY THE ANGELS ARE DIVERSIFIED ACCORDING TO MORE OR LESS REPLY
3009-10327-0077 THE GOOD OF THE SPECIES PREPONDERATES OVER THE GOOD OF THE INDIVIDUAL HENCE IT IS MUCH BETTER FOR THE SPECIES TO BE MULTIPLIED IN THE ANGELS THAN FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE MULTIPLIED
3009-10327-0078 TO BE THE ANGELS THEREFORE THE ANGELS ARE CORRUPTIBLE BY THEIR NATURE
3009-10327-0079 UNLESS THE HAND OF THE ALMIGHTY PRESERVED THEM BUT WHAT CAN BE BROUGHT TO NOTHING IS CORRUPTIBLE THEREFORE SINCE THE ANGELS WERE MADE BY GOD IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THEY ARE CORRUPTIBLE OF THEIR OWN NATURE ON THE CONTRARY
3009-10327-0080 HAVE UNFAILING LIFE BEING FREE FROM ALL CORRUPTION DEATH MATTER AND GENERATION I ANSWER THAT IT MUST NECESSARILY BE MAINTAINED THAT THE ANGELS ARE INCORRUPTIBLE
3009-10327-0081 OF THEIR OWN NATURE THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT NOTHING IS CORRUPTED EXCEPT BY ITS FORM BEING SEPARATED FROM THE MATTER HENCE SINCE AN ANGEL IS A SUBSISTING FORM
3009-10327-0082 TO BE CORRUPTIBLE FOR WHAT BELONGS TO ANYTHING CONSIDERED IN ITSELF CAN NEVER BE SEPARATED FROM IT BUT WHAT BELONGS TO A THING CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO SOMETHING ELSE CAN BE SEPARATED WHEN THAT SOMETHING ELSE IS TAKEN AWAY
3009-10327-0083 IN VIEW OF WHICH IT BELONGED TO IT ROUNDNESS CAN NEVER BE TAKEN FROM THE CIRCLE BECAUSE IT BELONGS TO IT OF ITSELF BUT A BRONZE CIRCLE CAN LOSE ROUNDNESS IF THE BRONZE BE DEPRIVED OF ITS CIRCULAR SHAPE NOW TO BE
3009-10327-0084 BELONGS TO A FORM CONSIDERED IN ITSELF FOR EVERYTHING IS AN ACTUAL BEING ACCORDING TO ITS FORM WHEREAS MATTER IS AN ACTUAL BEING BY THE FORM CONSEQUENTLY A SUBJECT COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM
3009-10327-0085 CEASES TO BE ACTUALLY WHEN THE FORM IS SEPARATED FROM THE MATTER BUT IF THE FORM SUBSISTS IN ITS OWN BEING AS HAPPENS
3009-10327-0086 THEREFORE THE ANGEL'S IMMATERIALITY IS THE CAUSE WHY IT IS INCORRUPTIBLE BY ITS OWN NATURE A TOKEN OF THIS INCORRUPTIBILITY CAN BE GATHERED FROM ITS INTELLECTUAL OPERATION
3009-10327-0087 FOR SINCE EVERYTHING ACTS ACCORDING AS IT IS ACTUAL THE OPERATION OF A THING INDICATES ITS MODE OF BEING NOW THE SPECIES AND NATURE OF THE OPERATION IS UNDERSTOOD FROM THE OBJECT BUT AN INTELLIGIBLE OBJECT
3009-10327-0088 BEING ABOVE TIME IS EVERLASTING HENCE EVERY INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCE IS INCORRUPTIBLE OF ITS OWN NATURE
3009-10327-0089 DAMASCENE IS DEALING WITH PERFECT IMMORTALITY WHICH INCLUDES COMPLETE IMMUTABILITY SINCE EVERY CHANGE IS A KIND OF DEATH
3009-10327-0090 BY THE EXPRESSION GODS PLATO UNDERSTANDS THE HEAVENLY BODIES WHICH HE SUPPOSED TO BE MADE UP OF ELEMENTS AND THEREFORE DISSOLUBLE OF THEIR OWN NATURE YET THEY ARE FOR EVER PRESERVED IN EXISTENCE BY THE DIVINE WILL
3009-10328-0000 IT WOULD SEEM THAT ANGELS HAVE BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM
3009-10328-0001 THAT IS IT BELONGS TO THE FATHER THE SON AND THE HOLY GHOST AS A PROPERTY OF NATURE THAT HE IS UNDERSTOOD TO EXIST WITHOUT ANY MATERIAL SUBSTANCE AND WITHOUT
3009-10328-0002 NEEDS THE HELP OF ANY CORPOREAL ORGAN BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT EVERY CREATED SPIRIT NEEDS CORPOREAL SUBSTANCE
3009-10328-0003 IS AKIN TO THAT OF AERIAL BODIES BUT THE NATURE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS IS THE SAME THEREFORE ANGELS HAVE BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM
3009-10328-0004 INCORPOREAL I ANSWER THAT THE ANGELS HAVE NOT BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM FOR WHATEVER BELONGS TO ANY NATURE AS AN ACCIDENT
3009-10328-0005 WHILE REFUSING TO SAY SUCH A THING OF GOD FOLLOWED THE ABOVE OPINION OF OTHERS REGARDING THE OTHER SUBSTANCES BEING DECEIVED HERE AS HE WAS ALSO IN MANY OTHER POINTS BY FOLLOWING THE OPINIONS OF THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS
3009-10328-0006 BERNARD'S EXPRESSION CAN BE EXPLAINED THAT THE CREATED SPIRIT NEEDS SOME BODILY INSTRUMENT WHICH IS NOT NATURALLY UNITED TO IT BUT ASSUMED FOR SOME PURPOSE AS WILL BE EXPLAINED
3009-10328-0007 NOT AS ASSERTING THE FACT BUT MERELY USING THE OPINION OF THE PLATONISTS WHO MAINTAINED THAT THERE ARE SOME AERIAL ANIMALS WHICH THEY TERMED DEMONS
3009-10328-0008 BECAUSE AN ANGEL HAS NO NEED FOR A BODY SINCE HIS OWN POWER EXCEEDS ALL BODILY POWER THEREFORE AN ANGEL DOES NOT ASSUME A BODY
3009-10328-0009 IT IS NOT SAID TO BE ASSUMED OTHERWISE IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT ALL BODIES MOVED BY THE ANGELS ARE ASSUMED BY THEM THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT ASSUME BODIES
3009-10328-0010 ANGELS DO NOT ASSUME BODIES FROM THE EARTH OR WATER OR THEY COULD NOT SUDDENLY DISAPPEAR NOR AGAIN FROM FIRE OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BURN WHATEVER THINGS THEY TOUCHED NOR AGAIN FROM AIR BECAUSE AIR IS WITHOUT SHAPE OR COLOR
3009-10328-0011 THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT ASSUME BODIES ON THE CONTRARY AUGUSTINE SAYS
3009-10328-0012 APPEARED TO ABRAHAM UNDER ASSUMED BODIES I ANSWER THAT SOME HAVE MAINTAINED THAT THE ANGELS NEVER ASSUME BODIES BUT THAT ALL THAT WE READ IN SCRIPTURE OF APPARITIONS OF ANGELS HAPPENED
3009-10328-0013 IN PROPHETIC VISION THAT IS ACCORDING TO IMAGINATION BUT THIS IS CONTRARY TO THE INTENT OF SCRIPTURE FOR WHATEVER IS BEHELD IN IMAGINARY VISION IS ONLY IN THE BEHOLDER'S IMAGINATION AND CONSEQUENTLY IS NOT SEEN BY EVERYBODY
3009-10328-0014 YET DIVINE SCRIPTURE FROM TIME TO TIME INTRODUCES ANGELS SO APPARENT AS TO BE SEEN COMMONLY BY ALL JUST AS THE ANGELS WHO APPEARED TO ABRAHAM WERE SEEN BY HIM AND BY HIS WHOLE FAMILY BY LOT AND BY THE CITIZENS OF SODOM
3009-10328-0015 IN LIKE MANNER THE ANGEL WHO APPEARED TO TOBIAS WAS SEEN BY ALL PRESENT FROM ALL THIS IT IS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT SUCH APPARITIONS WERE BEHELD BY BODILY VISION WHEREBY THE OBJECT SEEN EXISTS OUTSIDE THE PERSON BEHOLDING IT
3009-10328-0016 ANGELS NEED AN ASSUMED BODY NOT FOR THEMSELVES BUT ON OUR ACCOUNT THAT BY CONVERSING FAMILIARLY WITH MEN THEY MAY GIVE EVIDENCE OF THAT INTELLECTUAL COMPANIONSHIP WHICH MEN EXPECT TO HAVE WITH THEM IN THE LIFE TO COME
3009-10328-0017 MOREOVER THAT ANGELS ASSUMED BODIES UNDER THE OLD LAW WAS A FIGURATIVE INDICATION THAT THE WORD OF GOD WOULD TAKE A HUMAN BODY BECAUSE ALL THE APPARITIONS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
3009-10328-0018 WERE ORDAINED TO THAT ONE WHEREBY THE SON OF GOD APPEARED IN THE FLESH
3009-10328-0019 THE BODY ASSUMED IS UNITED TO THE ANGEL NOT AS ITS FORM NOR MERELY AS ITS MOVER BUT AS ITS MOVER REPRESENTED BY THE ASSUMED MOVABLE BODY FOR AS IN THE SACRED SCRIPTURE THE PROPERTIES OF INTELLIGIBLE THINGS ARE SET FORTH
3009-10328-0020 BY THE LIKENESSES OF THINGS SENSIBLE IN THE SAME WAY BY DIVINE POWER SENSIBLE BODIES ARE SO FASHIONED BY ANGELS AS FITTINGLY TO REPRESENT THE INTELLIGIBLE PROPERTIES OF AN ANGEL AND THIS IS WHAT WE MEAN BY AN ANGEL ASSUMING A BODY
3009-10328-0021 ALTHOUGH AIR AS LONG AS IT IS IN A STATE OF RAREFACTION HAS NEITHER SHAPE NOR COLOR YET WHEN CONDENSED IT CAN BOTH BE SHAPED AND COLORED AS APPEARS IN THE CLOUDS EVEN SO THE ANGELS ASSUME BODIES OF AIR
3009-10328-0022 CONDENSING IT BY THE DIVINE POWER IN SO FAR
3009-10328-0023 THROUGH ASSUMED BODIES I ANSWER THAT SOME FUNCTIONS OF LIVING SUBJECTS HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH OTHER OPERATIONS JUST AS SPEECH WHICH IS THE FUNCTION OF A LIVING CREATURE AGREES WITH OTHER SOUNDS OF INANIMATE THINGS IN SO FAR
3009-10328-0024 AS IT IS SOUND AND WALKING AGREES WITH OTHER MOVEMENTS IN SO FAR AS IT IS MOVEMENT CONSEQUENTLY VITAL FUNCTIONS CAN BE PERFORMED IN ASSUMED BODIES BY THE ANGELS AS TO THAT WHICH IS COMMON IN SUCH OPERATIONS
3009-10328-0025 AS IT IS IN NO WISE CONTRARY TO TRUTH FOR INTELLIGIBLE THINGS TO BE SET FORTH IN SCRIPTURE UNDER SENSIBLE FIGURES SINCE IT IS NOT SAID FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAINTAINING THAT INTELLIGIBLE THINGS ARE SENSIBLE
3009-10328-0026 BUT IN ORDER THAT PROPERTIES OF INTELLIGIBLE THINGS MAY BE UNDERSTOOD ACCORDING TO SIMILITUDE THROUGH SENSIBLE FIGURES SO IT IS NOT CONTRARY TO THE TRUTH OF THE HOLY ANGELS THAT THROUGH THEIR ASSUMED BODIES THEY APPEAR TO BE LIVING MEN
3009-10328-0027 ALTHOUGH THEY ARE REALLY NOT FOR THE BODIES ARE ASSUMED MERELY FOR THIS PURPOSE THAT THE SPIRITUAL PROPERTIES AND WORKS OF THE ANGELS MAY BE MANIFESTED BY THE PROPERTIES OF MAN AND OF HIS WORKS
3009-10328-0028 THIS COULD NOT SO FITTINGLY BE DONE IF THEY WERE TO ASSUME TRUE MEN BECAUSE THE PROPERTIES OF SUCH MEN WOULD LEAD US TO MEN AND NOT TO ANGELS
3009-10328-0029 SENSATION IS ENTIRELY A VITAL FUNCTION CONSEQUENTLY IT CAN IN NO WAY BE SAID THAT THE ANGELS PERCEIVE THROUGH THE ORGANS OF THEIR ASSUMED BODIES YET SUCH BODIES ARE NOT FASHIONED IN VAIN
3009-10328-0030 FOR THEY ARE NOT FASHIONED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SENSATION THROUGH THEM BUT TO THIS END THAT BY SUCH BODILY ORGANS THE SPIRITUAL POWERS OF THE ANGELS MAY BE MADE MANIFEST JUST AS BY THE EYE THE POWER OF THE ANGEL'S KNOWLEDGE IS POINTED OUT
3009-10328-0031 AND OTHER POWERS BY THE OTHER MEMBERS
3009-10328-0032 MOVEMENT COMING FROM A UNITED MOVER IS A PROPER FUNCTION OF LIFE BUT THE BODIES ASSUMED BY THE ANGELS ARE NOT THUS MOVED SINCE THE ANGELS ARE NOT THEIR FORMS YET THE ANGELS ARE MOVED ACCIDENTALLY WHEN SUCH BODIES ARE MOVED
3009-10328-0033 SINCE THEY ARE IN THEM AS MOVERS ARE IN THE MOVED AND THEY ARE HERE IN SUCH A WAY
3009-10328-0034 BUT RESOLVED INTO PRE EXISTING MATTER NEVERTHELESS CHRIST HAD A BODY OF SUCH A TRUE NATURE THAT FOOD COULD BE CHANGED INTO IT
3009-10328-0035 BUT THE FOOD TAKEN BY ANGELS WAS NEITHER CHANGED INTO THE ASSUMED BODY NOR WAS THE BODY OF SUCH A NATURE THAT FOOD COULD BE CHANGED INTO IT CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS NOT A TRUE EATING BUT FIGURATIVE OF SPIRITUAL EATING
3009-10328-0036 THIS IS WHAT THE ANGEL SAID TO TOBIAS WHEN I WAS WITH YOU I SEEMED INDEED TO EAT AND TO DRINK BUT I USE
3009-10328-0037 IN WHOM NEVERTHELESS HE WORSHIPPED GOD
3025-12971-0000 HE WAS AN ALMOST PERFECT TYPE OF THE PETTY SMALL TOWN MIDDLE CLASS LAWYER HE LIVED IN PANAMA PENNSYLVANIA HE HAD NEVER BEEN CAPTAIN OF ANYTHING EXCEPT THE CRESCENT VOLUNTEER FIRE COMPANY
3025-12971-0001 BUT HE OWNED THE TITLE BECAUSE HE COLLECTED RENTS WROTE INSURANCE AND MEDDLED WITH LAWSUITS HE CARRIED A QUITE VISIBLE MUSTACHE COMB AND WORE A COLLAR BUT NO TIE
3025-12971-0002 ON WARM DAYS HE APPEARED ON THE STREET IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES AND DISCUSSED THE COMPARATIVE TEMPERATURES OF THE PAST THIRTY YEARS WITH DOCTOR SMITH AND THE MANSION HOUSE BUS DRIVER
3025-12971-0003 HE NEVER USED THE WORD BEAUTY EXCEPT IN REFERENCE TO A SETTER DOG BEAUTY OF WORDS OR MUSIC OF FAITH OR REBELLION DID NOT EXIST FOR HIM HE RATHER FANCIED LARGE AMBITIOUS
3025-12971-0004 BANAL RED AND GOLD SUNSETS BUT HE MERELY GLANCED AT THEM AS HE STRAGGLED HOME AND REMARKED THAT THEY WERE NICE
3025-12971-0005 WERE IMMORAL HIS ENTIRE SYSTEM OF THEOLOGY WAS COMPRISED IN THE BIBLE WHICH HE NEVER READ AND THE METHODIST CHURCH WHICH HE RARELY ATTENDED
3025-12971-0006 AND HE DESIRED NO SYSTEM OF ECONOMICS BEYOND THE CURRENT PLATFORM OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HE WAS AIMLESSLY INDUSTRIOUS CROTCHETY BUT KIND AND ALMOST QUIXOTICALLY HONEST
3025-12971-0007 HE BELIEVED THAT PANAMA PENNSYLVANIA WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY THIS LAST OPINION WAS NOT SHARED BY HIS WIFE NOR BY HIS DAUGHTER UNA
3025-12971-0008 MISSUS GOLDEN WAS ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO ASPIRE JUST ENOUGH TO BE VAGUELY DISCONTENTED NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM TOIL AT THE ACQUISITION OF UNDERSTANDING AND KNOWLEDGE
3025-12971-0009 SHE HAD FLOATED INTO A COMFORTABLE SEMI BELIEF IN A SEMI CHRISTIAN SCIENCE AND SHE READ NOVELS WITH A CONVICTION THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN A ROMANTIC PERSON IF SHE HADN'T MARRIED MISTER GOLDEN
3025-12971-0010 NOT BUT WHAT HE'S A FINE MAN AND VERY BRIGHT AND ALL BUT HE HASN'T GOT MUCH IMAGINATION OR ANY WELL ROMANCE SHE WROTE POETRY ABOUT SPRING AND NEIGHBORHOOD BIRTHS
3025-12971-0011 AND CAPTAIN GOLDEN ADMIRED IT SO ACTIVELY THAT HE READ IT ALOUD TO CALLERS SHE ATTENDED ALL THE MEETINGS OF THE PANAMA STUDY CLUB AND DESIRED TO LEARN FRENCH
3025-12971-0012 THOUGH SHE NEVER WENT BEYOND BORROWING A FRENCH GRAMMAR FROM THE EPISCOPALIAN RECTOR AND LEARNING ONE CONJUGATION BUT IN THE PIONEER SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT SHE TOOK NO PART SHE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS QUITE LADYLIKE
3025-12971-0013 SHE WAS A POOR COOK AND HER HOUSE ALWAYS SMELLED STUFFY BUT SHE LIKED TO HAVE FLOWERS ABOUT SHE WAS PRETTY OF FACE FRAIL OF BODY GENUINELY GRACIOUS OF MANNER
3025-12971-0014 SHE REALLY DID LIKE PEOPLE LIKED TO GIVE COOKIES TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD BOYS AND IF YOU WEREN'T IMPATIENT WITH HER SLACKNESS YOU FOUND HER A WISTFUL AND TOUCHING FIGURE IN HER SLIGHT YOUTHFULNESS
3025-12971-0015 AND IN THE AMBITION TO BE A ROMANTIC PERSONAGE A MARIE ANTOINETTE OR A MISSUS GROVER CLEVELAND WHICH AMBITION SHE STILL RETAINED AT FIFTY FIVE
3025-12971-0016 AND IF THEY WERE REFUSED LET HER LIPS DROOP IN A MANNER WHICH ONLY A BRUTE COULD WITHSTAND SHE PLAINTIVELY ADMIRED HER EFFICIENT DAUGHTER UNA
3025-12971-0017 UNA GOLDEN WAS A GOOD LITTLE WOMAN NOT PRETTY NOT NOISY NOT PARTICULARLY ARTICULATE BUT INSTINCTIVELY ON THE INSIDE OF THINGS
3025-12971-0018 NATURALLY ABLE TO SIZE UP PEOPLE AND AFFAIRS SHE HAD COMMON SENSE AND UNKINDLED PASSION
3025-12971-0019 WITH A HEALTHY WOMAN'S SIMPLE LONGING FOR LOVE AND LIFE AT TWENTY FOUR UNA HAD HALF A DOZEN TIMES FANCIED HERSELF IN LOVE SHE HAD BEEN EMBRACED AT A DANCE
3025-12971-0020 AND FELT THE STIRRING OF A DESIRE FOR SURRENDER BUT ALWAYS A NATIVE SHREWDNESS HAD KEPT HER FROM AGONIZING OVER THESE AFFAIRS SHE WAS NOT AND WILL NOT BE A MISUNDERSTOOD GENIUS
3025-12971-0021 AN UNDEVELOPED ARTIST AN EMBRYONIC LEADER IN FEMINISM NOR AN UGLY DUCKLING WHO WOULD PUT ON A GEORGETTE HAT AND CAPTIVATE THE THEATRICAL WORLD SHE WAS AN UNTRAINED AMBITIOUS

3025-12971-0023 WITH TOO MUCH READING OF POPPY FLAVORED NOVELS SHE WANTED TO LEARN LEARN ANYTHING BUT THE GOLDENS WERE TOO RESPECTABLE TO PERMIT HER TO HAVE A JOB
3025-12971-0024 AND TOO POOR TO PERMIT HER TO GO TO COLLEGE FROM THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN WHEN SHE HAD GRADUATED FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL IN WHITE RIBBONS AND HEAVY NEW BOOTS AND TIGHT NEW ORGANDY TO TWENTY THREE
3025-12971-0025 SHE HAD KEPT HOUSE AND GONE TO GOSSIP PARTIES AND UNMETHODICALLY READ BOOKS FROM THE TOWN LIBRARY WALTER SCOTT RICHARD LE GALLIENNE HARRIET BEECHER STOWE MISSUS HUMPHRY WARD

3025-12971-0027 WAS A DISBELIEF IN PANAMA PENNSYLVANIA SHE WAS LIKELY NEVER TO BE ANYTHING MORE AMAZING THAN A MOTHER AND WIFE WHO WOULD ENTERTAIN THE HONITON EMBROIDERY CIRCLE TWICE A YEAR
3025-12971-0028 THESE GLASSES MADE A BUSINESS LIKE CENTER TO HER FACE YOU FELT THAT WITHOUT THEM SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO CHILDISH HER MOUTH WAS AS KIND AS HER SPIRITED EYES BUT IT DROOPED
3025-12971-0029 HER BODY WAS SO FEMININELY SOFT THAT YOU REGARDED HER AS RATHER PLUMP BUT FOR ALL HER CURVING HIPS AND THE THICK ANKLES WHICH SHE CONSIDERED COMMON SHE WAS RATHER ANEMIC
3025-12971-0030 HER CHEEKS WERE ROUND NOT ROSY BUT CLEAR AND SOFT HER LIPS A PALE PINK HER CHIN WAS PLUCKY AND UNDIMPLED IT WAS USUALLY SPOTTED WITH ONE OR TWO UNIMPORTANT ERUPTIONS
3025-12971-0031 WHICH SHE KEPT SO WELL COVERED WITH POWDER THAT THEY WERE NEVER NOTICEABLE NO ONE EVER THOUGHT OF THEM EXCEPT UNA HERSELF TO WHOM THEY WERE TRAGIC BLEMISHES WHICH SHE TIMOROUSLY EXAMINED IN THE MIRROR
3025-12971-0032 BUT THEY KEPT STARTLING HER ANEW SHE WOULD SECRETLY TOUCH THEM WITH A WORRIED FOREFINGER AND WONDER WHETHER MEN WERE ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING ELSE IN HER FACE
3025-12971-0033 YOU REMEMBERED HER BEST AS SHE HURRIED THROUGH THE STREET IN HER TAN MACKINTOSH WITH ITS YELLOW VELVETEEN COLLAR TURNED HIGH UP AND ONE OF THOSE MODEST ROUND HATS TO WHICH SHE WAS ADDICTED
3025-12971-0034 SHE TRUSTED IN THE VILLAGE IDEAL OF VIRGINAL VACUOUSNESS AS THE TYPE OF BEAUTY WHICH MOST CAPTIVATED MEN THOUGH EVERY YEAR SHE WAS MORE SHREWDLY DOUBTFUL OF THE DIVINE SUPERIORITY OF THESE MEN

3025-12971-0038 TO WEAR BLACK AND LOOK WAN SHE SOBBED ON UNA'S SHOULDER SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS LONELY AND UNA STURDILY COMFORTED HER AND LOOKED FOR WORK

3025-12971-0044 CHANCE CHANCE AND WASTE RULE THEM BOTH AND THE WORLD PASSES BY WHILE THE MOTHER HAS HER GAMES OF CARDS WITH DAUGHTER AND DEEMS HERSELF UNSELFISH BECAUSE NOW AND THEN SHE LETS DAUGHTER JOIN A PARTY
3025-12971-0045 ONLY TO HASTEN BACK TO MOTHER AND EVEN WONDERS WHY DAUGHTER DOESN'T TAKE AN INTEREST IN GIRLS HER OWN AGE THAT UGLY COUPLE ON THE PORCH OF THE APPLE SAUCE AND WASH PITCHER BOARDING HOUSE
3025-12971-0046 THE MOTHER A MUTE DWARFISH PUNCHINELLO AND THE DAUGHTER A DRAB WOMAN OF FORTY WITH A MOLE A WART A SILENCE THAT CHARMING MOTHER OF WHITE HAIR AND REAL LACE WITH THE WELL GROOMED DAUGHTER
3025-12971-0047 THAT COMFORTABLE MOTHER AT HOME AND DAUGHTER IN AN OFFICE BUT WITH NO SUITORS NO AMBITION BEYOND THE ONE AT HOME THEY ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER PHENOMENON
3025-12971-0048 THAT MOST TOUCHING MOST DESTRUCTIVE EXAMPLE OF SELFLESS UNSELFISHNESS WHICH ROBS ALL THE GENERATIONS TO COME BECAUSE MOTHER HAS NEVER BEEN TRAINED TO ENDURE THE LONG LONG THOUGHTS OF SOLITUDE
3025-12971-0049 BECAUSE SHE SEES NOTHING BY HERSELF AND WITHIN HERSELF HEARS NO DIVERTING VOICE THERE WERE MANY SUCH MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS IN PANAMA
3025-12971-0050 IF THEY WERE WEALTHY DAUGHTER COLLECTED RENTS AND SAW LAWYERS AND BELONGED TO A CLUB AND TRIED TO KEEP YOUTHFUL AT PARTIES IF MIDDLE CLASS DAUGHTER TAUGHT SCHOOL ALMOST INVARIABLY
3025-12971-0051 IF POOR MOTHER DID THE WASHING AND DAUGHTER COLLECTED IT SO IT WAS MARKED DOWN FOR UNA THAT SHE SHOULD BE A TEACHER NOT THAT SHE WANTED TO BE A TEACHER
3025-12971-0052 AFTER GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL SHE HAD SPENT TWO MISERABLE TERMS OF TEACHING IN THE SMALL WHITE DISTRICT SCHOOL FOUR MILES OUT ON THE BETHLEHEM ROAD
3025-12971-0053 SHE HATED THE DRIVE OUT AND BACK THE AIRLESS ROOM AND THE FOUL OUTBUILDINGS THE SHY STUPID STARING CHILDREN THE JOLLY LITTLE ARITHMETICAL PROBLEMS ABOUT WALL PAPER PILES OF LUMBER
3025-12971-0054 THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT NOTORIOUSLY INEFFICIENT WORKMEN WILL TAKE TO DO A CERTAIN PIECE OF WORK UNA WAS HONEST ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN HONEST TEACHER
3025-12971-0055 THAT SHE NEITHER LOVED MASSES OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN NOR HAD ANY IDEALS OF DEVELOPING THE NEW GENERATION BUT SHE HAD TO MAKE MONEY OF COURSE SHE WOULD TEACH
3025-12971-0056 WHEN SHE TALKED OVER AFFAIRS WITH HER TEARFUL MOTHER MISSUS GOLDEN ALWAYS ENDED BY SUGGESTING I WONDER IF PERHAPS YOU COULDN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL TEACHING AGAIN
3025-12971-0057 EVERYBODY SAID YOU WERE SO SUCCESSFUL AND MAYBE I COULD GET SOME NEEDLEWORK TO DO I DO WANT TO HELP SO MUCH MISSUS GOLDEN DID APPARENTLY REALLY WANT TO HELP
3025-12971-0058 BUT SHE NEVER SUGGESTED ANYTHING BESIDES TEACHING AND SHE WENT ON RECKLESSLY INVESTING IN THE NICEST MOURNING MEANTIME UNA TRIED TO FIND OTHER WORK IN PANAMA
3025-12971-0059 SEEN FROM A BALLOON PANAMA IS MERELY A MOLE ON THE LONG HILL SLOPES BUT TO UNA ITS FEW STRAGGLY STREETS WERE A WHOLE COSMOS
3025-12971-0060 SHE KNEW SOMEBODY IN EVERY SINGLE HOUSE SHE KNEW JUST WHERE THE SUCCOTASH THE CAKE BOXES THE CLOTHES LINES WERE KEPT IN EACH OF THE GROCERY STORES AND ON MARKET SATURDAYS
3025-12971-0061 SHE COULD WAIT ON HERSELF SHE SUMMED UP THE WHOLE TOWN AND ITS POSSIBILITIES AND SHE WONDERED WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THE WORLD OUT BEYOND PANAMA HAD FOR HER SHE RECALLED TWO TRIPS TO PHILADELPHIA
3025-12971-0062 AND ONE TO HARRISBURG SHE MADE OUT A LIST OF OPENINGS WITH SUCH METHODICAL EXACTNESS AS SHE DEVOTED TO KEEPING THE DWINDLING LODGE INSURANCE FROM DISAPPEARING ALTOGETHER
3025-12971-0063 HERS WAS NO POETIC OUTREACH LIKE THAT OF THE YOUNG GENIUS WHO WANTS TO BE OFF FOR BOHEMIA IT WAS A QUESTION OF EARNING MONEY IN THE LEAST TEDIOUS WAY
3025-12971-0064 UNA WAS FACING THE FEMINIST PROBLEM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE WORD FEMINIST MEANT THIS WAS HER LIST OF FAIR FIELDS OF FRUITFUL LABOR
3025-12971-0065 SHE COULD AND PROBABLY WOULD TEACH IN SOME HEN COOP OF PEDAGOGY SHE COULD MARRY BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO WANT HER EXCEPT OLD HENRY CARSON THE WIDOWER
3025-12971-0066 WHO CALLED ON HER AND HER MOTHER ONCE IN TWO WEEKS AND WOULD PROPOSE WHENEVER SHE ENCOURAGED HIM TO THIS SHE KNEW SCIENTIFICALLY SHE HAD ONLY TO SIT BESIDE HIM ON THE SOFA
3025-12971-0067 LET HER HAND DROP DOWN BESIDE HIS BUT SHE POSITIVELY AND UNGRATEFULLY DIDN'T WANT TO MARRY HENRY AND LISTEN TO HIS HAWKING AND HIS GRUMBLING FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE
3025-12971-0068 SOONER OR LATER ONE OF THE BOYS MIGHT PROPOSE BUT IN A SMALL TOWN IT WAS ALL A GAMBLE
3025-12971-0069 THERE WEREN'T SO VERY MANY DESIRABLE YOUNG MEN MOST OF THE ENERGETIC ONES WENT OFF TO PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK TRUE THAT JENNIE MC TEVISH HAD BEEN MARRIED AT THIRTY ONE
3025-12971-0070 WHEN EVERYBODY HAD THOUGHT SHE WAS HOPELESSLY AN OLD MAID YET HERE WAS BIRDIE MAYBERRY UNMARRIED AT THIRTY FOUR NO ONE COULD EVER UNDERSTAND WHY FOR SHE HAD BEEN THE PRETTIEST AND JOLLIEST GIRL IN TOWN
3025-12971-0071 SHE COULD GO OFF AND STUDY MUSIC LAW MEDICINE ELOCUTION OR ANY OF THAT AMAZING HODGE PODGE OF PURSUITS WHICH ARE PERMITTED TO SMALL TOWN WOMEN
3025-12971-0072 BUT SHE REALLY COULDN'T AFFORD TO DO ANY OF THESE AND BESIDES SHE HAD NO TALENT FOR MUSIC OF A HIGHER GRADE THAN SOUSA AND VICTOR HERBERT SHE WAS AFRAID OF LAWYERS
3025-12971-0073 BLOOD MADE HER SICK AND HER VOICE WAS TOO QUIET FOR THE NOBLE ART OF ELOCUTION AS PRACTISED BY SEVERAL SATIN WAISTED SEMI ARTISTIC LADIES WHO GAVE READINGS
3025-12971-0074 SHE COULD HAVE A JOB SELLING DRY GOODS BEHIND THE COUNTER IN THE HUB STORE BUT THAT MEANT LOSS OF CASTE SHE COULD TEACH DANCING BUT SHE COULDN'T DANCE PARTICULARLY WELL
3025-12971-0075 AND THAT WAS ALL THAT SHE COULD DO SHE HAD TRIED TO FIND WORK AS OFFICE WOMAN FOR DOCTOR MAYBERRY THE DENTIST IN THE OFFICE OF THE PANAMA WOOD TURNING COMPANY IN THE POST OFFICE
3025-12971-0076 AS LOFTY ENTHRONED CASHIER FOR THE HUB STORE PAINTING PLACE CARDS AND MAKING FANCY WORK FOR THE ART NEEDLEWORK EXCHANGE
3025-12971-0077 THE JOB BEHIND THE COUNTER IN THE HUB STORE WAS THE ONLY ONE OFFERED HER IF I WERE ONLY A BOY SIGHED UNA
3025-12971-0078 I COULD GO TO WORK IN THE HARDWARE STORE OR ON THE RAILROAD OR ANYWHERE AND NOT LOSE RESPECTABILITY
3025-12971-0079 SQUIRE UPDEGRAFF THE REAL ESTATE AND INSURANCE MAN THAT HER EXPERIENCE WITH CAPTAIN GOLDEN WOULD MAKE HER A PERFECT TREASURE IN THE OFFICE SQUIRE UPDEGRAFF HAD LEAPED UP AT HER ENTRANCE AND BLARED
3025-12971-0080 WELL WELL AND HOW IS THE LITTLE GIRL MAKING IT HE HAD SET OUT A CHAIR FOR HER AND HELD HER HAND BUT HE KNEW THAT HER ONLY EXPERIENCE WITH HER FATHER'S AFFAIRS HAD BEEN AN EFFORT TO BALANCE CAPTAIN GOLDEN'S ACCOUNT BOOKS
3025-12971-0081 WHICH WERE WORKS OF GENIUS IN SO FAR AS THEY WERE COMPOSED ACCORDING TO THE INSPIRATIONAL METHOD SO THERE WAS NOTHING VERY SERIOUS IN THEIR ELABORATE DISCUSSION OF GIVING UNA A JOB
3025-12971-0083 TRIPPING BY IN CANVAS SNEAKERS AND A LARGE RED HAIR RIBBON SHOUTED AT HER AND CHARLIE MARTINDALE OF THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK NODDED TO HER BUT THESE EXQUISITES WERE TOO YOUNG FOR HER
3025-12971-0084 THEY DANCED TOO WELL AND LAUGHED TOO EASILY THE PERSON WHO STOPPED HER FOR A LONG CURBSTONE CONFERENCE ABOUT THE WEATHER WHILE MOST OF THE TOWN OBSERVED AND GOSSIPED WAS THE FATEFUL HENRY CARSON
3025-12971-0085 MISS MATTIE PUGH DROVE BY RETURNING FROM DISTRICT SCHOOL MISS MATTIE HAD TAUGHT AT CLARK'S CROSSING FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS HAD GROWN MEEK AND MEAGER AND HOPELESS
3025-12971-0086 HEAVENS THOUGHT UNA WOULD SHE HAVE TO BE SHUT INTO THE FETID BARN OF A SMALL SCHOOL UNLESS SHE MARRIED HENRY I WON'T BE GENTEEL
3025-12971-0087 A CATARACT OF PROTEST POURED THROUGH HER ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE SHE WOULD HAVE TO MEET THAT DODDERING OLD MISTER MOSELY WHO WAS UNAVOIDABLY BEARING DOWN ON HER NOW
3025-12971-0088 AND BE HELD BY HIM IN LONG MEANINGLESS TALKS AND THERE WAS NOTHING AMUSING TO DO SHE WAS SO FRIGHTFULLY BORED SHE SUDDENLY HATED THE TOWN HATED EVERY EVENING SHE WOULD HAVE TO SPEND THERE
3025-12971-0089 READING NEWSPAPERS AND PLAYING CARDS WITH HER MOTHER AND DREADING A CALL FROM MISTER HENRY CARSON SHE WANTED WANTED SOME ONE TO LOVE TO TALK WITH
3025-12971-0090 WHY HAD SHE DISCOURAGED THE BEAUTIFUL CHARLIE MARTINDALE THE TIME HE HAD TRIED TO KISS HER AT A DANCE CHARLIE WAS FATUOUS BUT HE WAS YOUNG AND SHE WANTED YES
3025-12971-0091 YES THAT WAS IT SHE WANTED YOUTH SHE WHO WAS HERSELF SO YOUNG AND SHE WOULD GROW OLD HERE UNLESS SOME ONE ONE OF THESE GODLIKE YOUNG MEN CONDESCENDED TO RECOGNIZE HER
3025-12971-0092 GROW OLD AMONG THESE STREETS LIKE PILES OF LUMBER SHE CHARGED INTO THE SMALL WHITE AMBLING GOLDEN HOUSE WITH ITS PECULIAR SMELL OF STALE LAMB GRAVY
3025-12971-0093 AND ON THE OLD BROKEN COUCH WHERE HER FATHER HAD SNORED ALL THROUGH EVERY BRIGHT SUNDAY AFTERNOON SHE SOBBED FEEBLY SHE RAISED HER HEAD TO CONSIDER A NOISE OVERHEAD
3025-12971-0094 THE FAINT DOMESTIC THUNDER OF A SEWING MACHINE SHAKING THE WALLS WITH ITS RHYTHM THE MACHINE STOPPED SHE HEARD THE NOISE OF SCISSORS DROPPED ON THE FLOOR THE MOST STUFFILY DOMESTIC SOUND IN THE WORLD
3025-12971-0095 THE AIRLESS HOUSE WAS CRUSHING HER SHE SPRANG UP AND THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN THERE WAS NO PLACE TO WHICH SHE COULD FLEE HENRY CARSON AND THE DISTRICT SCHOOL WERE MENACING HER
3025-12971-0096 AND MEANTIME SHE HAD TO FIND OUT WHAT HER MOTHER WAS SEWING WHETHER SHE HAD AGAIN BEEN WASTING MONEY IN BUYING MOURNING POOR POOR LITTLE MOTHER WORKING AWAY HAPPY UP THERE
3025-12971-0097 AND I'VE GOT TO GO AND SCOLD YOU UNA AGONIZED OH I WANT TO EARN MONEY I WANT TO EARN REAL MONEY FOR YOU SHE SAW A QUADRANGLE OF WHITE ON THE TABLE BEHIND A BOOK
3025-12971-0098 SHE POUNCED ON IT IT WAS A LETTER FROM MISSUS SESSIONS AND UNA SCRATCHED IT OPEN EXCITEDLY MISTER AND MISSUS ALBERT SESSIONS OF PANAMA HAD GONE TO NEW YORK
3025-12971-0099 MISTER SESSIONS WAS IN MACHINERY THEY LIKED NEW YORK THEY LIVED IN A FLAT AND WENT TO THEATERS MISSUS SESSIONS WAS A PILLOWY SOUL WHOM UNA TRUSTED WHY DON'T YOU
3025-12971-0100 WROTE MISSUS SESSIONS IF YOU DON'T FIND THE KIND OF WORK YOU WANT IN PANAMA THINK ABOUT COMING UP TO NEW YORK AND TAKING STENOGRAPHY THERE ARE LOTS OF CHANCES HERE FOR SECRETARIES ET CETERA
3025-12971-0101 UNA CAREFULLY LAID DOWN THE LETTER SHE WENT OVER AND STRAIGHTENED HER MOTHER'S RED WOOL SLIPPERS SHE WANTED TO POSTPONE FOR AN EXQUISITE THROBBING MOMENT
3025-12971-0102 THE JOY OF ANNOUNCING TO HERSELF THAT SHE HAD MADE A DECISION SHE WOULD GO TO NEW YORK BECOME A STENOGRAPHER A SECRETARY TO A CORPORATION PRESIDENT A RICH WOMAN FREE
3025-12971-0103 RESPONSIBLE THE FACT OF MAKING THIS REVOLUTIONARY DECISION SO QUICKLY GAVE HER A FEELING OF POWER OF ALREADY BEING A BUSINESS WOMAN
3025-12971-0104 SHE GALLOPED UP STAIRS TO THE ROOM WHERE HER MOTHER WAS DRIVING THE SEWING MACHINE MUMSIE SHE CRIED WE'RE GOING TO NEW YORK I'M GOING TO LEARN TO BE A BUSINESS WOMAN
3025-12971-0105 AND THE LITTLE MOTHER WILL BE ALL DRESSED IN SATIN AND SILKS AND DINE ON WHAT IS IT AND PEACHES AND CREAM THE POEM DON'T COME OUT RIGHT BUT OH MY LITTLE MOTHER WE'RE GOING OUT ADVENTURING WE ARE
3025-12971-0106 SHE PLUNGED DOWN BESIDE HER MOTHER BURROWED HER HEAD IN HER MOTHER'S LAP KISSED THAT HAND WHOSE SKIN WAS LIKE THINNEST WRINKLY TISSUE PAPER
3025-12971-0107 HAS SOME ONE SENT FOR US IS IT THE LETTER FROM EMMA SESSIONS WHAT DID SHE SAY IN IT SHE SUGGESTED IT BUT WE ARE GOING UP INDEPENDENT BUT CAN WE AFFORD TO
3032-19361-0000 LIFE AND WORK OF KEPLER KEPLER WAS BORN IN DECEMBER FIFTEEN SEVENTY ONE
3032-19361-0001 FATHER AN OFFICER IN THE DUKE'S ARMY MOTHER SOMETHING OF A VIRAGO BOTH VERY POOR KEPLER WAS UTILIZED AS A TAVERN POT BOY BUT ULTIMATELY SENT TO A CHARITY SCHOOL AND THENCE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TUEBINGEN
3032-19361-0002 THEIR TIMES OF REVOLUTION AND THEIR DISTANCES FROM THE SUN ULTIMATELY HIT UPON HIS FANCIFUL REGULAR SOLID HYPOTHESIS AND PUBLISHED HIS FIRST BOOK IN FIFTEEN NINETY SEVEN IN FIFTEEN NINETY NINE WAS INVITED BY TYCHO TO PRAGUE
3032-19361-0003 AND THERE APPOINTED IMPERIAL MATHEMATICIAN AT A HANDSOME BUT SELDOM PAID SALARY OBSERVED THE NEW STAR OF SIXTEEN O FOUR ENDEAVOURED TO FIND THE LAW OF REFRACTION OF LIGHT FROM VITELLIO'S MEASUREMENTS BUT FAILED
3032-19361-0004 AFTER INCREDIBLE LABOUR THROUGH INNUMERABLE WRONG GUESSES AND SIX YEARS OF ALMOST INCESSANT CALCULATION HE AT LENGTH EMERGED IN HIS TWO LAWS DISCOVERIES WHICH SWEPT AWAY ALL EPICYCLES DEFERENTS
3032-19361-0005 EQUANTS AND OTHER REMNANTS OF THE GREEK SYSTEM AND USHERED IN THE DAWN OF MODERN ASTRONOMY
3032-19361-0006 PLANETS MOVE IN ELLIPSES WITH THE SUN IN ONE FOCUS LAW TWO THE RADIUS VECTOR OR LINE JOINING SUN AND PLANET SWEEPS OUT EQUAL AREAS IN EQUAL TIMES
3032-19361-0007 PUBLISHED HIS SECOND BOOK CONTAINING THESE LAWS IN SIXTEEN O NINE DEATH OF RUDOLPH IN SIXTEEN TWELVE AND SUBSEQUENT INCREASED MISERY AND MISFORTUNE OF KEPLER
3032-19361-0008 ULTIMATELY DISCOVERED THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TIMES AND DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN GROPING ALL HIS MATURE LIFE AND ANNOUNCED IT IN SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN LAW THREE
3032-19361-0009 THE SQUARE OF THE TIME OF REVOLUTION OR YEAR OF EACH PLANET IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE CUBE OF ITS MEAN DISTANCE FROM THE SUN THE BOOK IN WHICH THIS LAW WAS PUBLISHED ON CELESTIAL HARMONIES
3032-19361-0010 WAS DEDICATED TO JAMES OF ENGLAND IN SIXTEEN TWENTY HAD TO INTERVENE TO PROTECT HIS MOTHER FROM BEING TORTURED FOR WITCHCRAFT ACCEPTED A PROFESSORSHIP AT LINZ PUBLISHED THE RUDOLPHINE TABLES IN SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVEN
3032-19361-0011 AND HIS OWN THEORY MADE A LAST EFFORT TO OVERCOME HIS POVERTY BY GETTING THE ARREARS OF HIS SALARY PAID AT PRAGUE BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AND CONTRACTING BRAIN FEVER ON THE JOURNEY DIED IN NOVEMBER
3032-19361-0012 AND MISFORTUNE AND PLACED HIMSELF IN THE VERY HIGHEST RANK OF SCIENTIFIC MEN HIS LAWS SO EXTRAORDINARILY DISCOVERED INTRODUCED ORDER AND SIMPLICITY
3032-19361-0013 INTO WHAT ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CHAOS OF DETAILED OBSERVATIONS AND THEY SERVED AS A SECURE BASIS FOR THE SPLENDID ERECTION MADE ON THEM BY NEWTON SEVEN PLANETS OF THE PTOLEMAIC SYSTEM
3032-19361-0014 BUT NOT ABOVE THE AVERAGE IN THEORETICAL AND MATHEMATICAL POWER THE OTHER POOR SICKLY DEVOID OF EXPERIMENTAL GIFTS AND UNFITTED BY NATURE FOR ACCURATE OBSERVATION
3032-19361-0015 BUT STRONG ALMOST BEYOND COMPETITION IN SPECULATIVE SUBTLETY AND INNATE MATHEMATICAL PERCEPTION THE ONE IS THE COMPLEMENT OF THE OTHER AND FROM THE FACT OF THEIR FOLLOWING EACH OTHER SO CLOSELY
3032-19361-0016 AND WAS REDUCED TO KEEPING A TAVERN YOUNG JOHN KEPLER WAS THEREUPON TAKEN FROM SCHOOL AND EMPLOYED AS POT BOY BETWEEN THE AGES OF NINE AND TWELVE HE WAS A SICKLY LAD
3032-19361-0017 SUBJECT TO VIOLENT ILLNESSES FROM THE CRADLE SO THAT HIS LIFE WAS FREQUENTLY DESPAIRED OF ULTIMATELY HE WAS SENT TO A MONASTIC SCHOOL AND THENCE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TUEBINGEN WHERE HE GRADUATED SECOND ON THE LIST
3032-19361-0018 MEANWHILE HOME AFFAIRS HAD GONE TO RACK AND RUIN HIS FATHER ABANDONED THE HOME AND LATER DIED ABROAD THE MOTHER QUARRELLED WITH ALL HER RELATIONS INCLUDING HER SON JOHN
3032-19361-0019 THOUGH STIPULATING THAT IT SHOULD NOT DEBAR HIM FROM SOME MORE BRILLIANT PROFESSION WHEN THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR ASTRONOMY IN THOSE DAYS SEEMS TO HAVE RANKED AS A MINOR SCIENCE LIKE MINERALOGY OR METEOROLOGY NOW
3032-19361-0020 AND AS HE HAD A MOST SINGULARLY RESTLESS AND INQUISITIVE MIND FULL OF APPRECIATION OF EVERYTHING RELATING TO NUMBER AND MAGNITUDE WAS A BORN SPECULATOR AND THINKER JUST AS MOZART WAS A BORN MUSICIAN
3032-19361-0021 OR BIDDER A BORN CALCULATOR HE WAS AGITATED BY QUESTIONS SUCH AS THESE WHY ARE THERE EXACTLY SIX PLANETS IS THERE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THEIR ORBITAL DISTANCES
3032-19361-0022 OR BETWEEN THEIR ORBITS AND THE TIMES OF DESCRIBING THEM THESE THINGS TORMENTED HIM AND HE THOUGHT ABOUT THEM DAY AND NIGHT IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES THIS QUESTIONING WHY THERE SHOULD BE SIX PLANETS
3032-19361-0023 IF YOU INSCRIBE IN A CIRCLE A LARGE NUMBER OF EQUILATERAL TRIANGLES THEY ENVELOP ANOTHER CIRCLE
3032-19361-0024 BROODING OVER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT THE IDEA OF TRYING SOLID FIGURES SUDDENLY STRIKES HIM WHAT HAVE PLANE FIGURES TO DO WITH THE CELESTIAL ORBITS HE CRIES OUT INSCRIBE THE REGULAR SOLIDS
3032-19361-0025 AND THEN BRILLIANT IDEA HE REMEMBERS THAT THERE ARE BUT FIVE EUCLID HAD SHOWN
3032-19361-0026 THE REASON OF THERE BEING ONLY SIX SEEMS TO BE ATTAINED THIS COINCIDENCE ASSURES HIM HE IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM AND HOPE HE REPRESENTS THE EARTH'S ORBIT BY A SPHERE
3032-19361-0027 AS THE NORM AND MEASURE OF ALL ROUND IT HE CIRCUMSCRIBES A DODECAHEDRON AND PUTS ANOTHER SPHERE ROUND THAT WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY THE ORBIT OF MARS ROUND THAT AGAIN A TETRAHEDRON
3032-19361-0028 AN OCTAHEDRON WHICH FIGURES HE TAKES TO INCLOSE THE SPHERES OF VENUS AND OF MERCURY RESPECTIVELY
3032-19361-0029 CAN NEVER BE TOLD IN WORDS I REGRETTED NO MORE THE TIME WASTED I TIRED OF NO LABOUR I SHUNNED NO TOIL OF RECKONING DAYS AND NIGHTS SPENT IN CALCULATION
3032-19361-0030 UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF THE EMPEROR RUDOLPH AND AS HE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE BY FAR THE BEST PLANETARY OBSERVATIONS OF ANY MAN LIVING KEPLER WROTE TO HIM TO KNOW IF HE MIGHT COME AND EXAMINE THEM SO AS TO PERFECT HIS THEORY
3032-19361-0031 TYCHO IMMEDIATELY REPLIED COME NOT AS A STRANGER BUT AS A VERY WELCOME FRIEND COME AND SHARE IN MY OBSERVATIONS WITH SUCH INSTRUMENTS AS I HAVE WITH ME AND AS A DEARLY BELOVED ASSOCIATE
3032-19361-0032 AFTER THIS VISIT TYCHO WROTE AGAIN OFFERING HIM THE POST OF MATHEMATICAL ASSISTANT WHICH AFTER HESITATION WAS ACCEPTED PART OF THE HESITATION KEPLER EXPRESSES BY SAYING THAT
3032-19361-0033 SO THAT HE HAD TO APPLY FOR HELP TO TYCHO IT IS CLEAR INDEED THAT FOR SOME TIME NOW HE SUBSISTED ENTIRELY ON THE BOUNTY OF TYCHO AND HE EXPRESSES HIMSELF
3032-19361-0034 I MUST READ YOU A LETTER WRITTEN TO HIM BY KEPLER IT SEEMS THAT KEPLER ON ONE OF HIS ABSENCES FROM PRAGUE DRIVEN HALF MAD WITH POVERTY AND TROUBLE FELL FOUL OF TYCHO
3032-19361-0035 WHOM HE THOUGHT TO BE BEHAVING BADLY IN MONEY MATTERS TO HIM AND HIS FAMILY AND WROTE HIM A VIOLENT LETTER FULL OF REPROACHES AND INSULTS
3032-19361-0036 POINTING OUT THE GROUNDLESSNESS AND INGRATITUDE OF THE ACCUSATION KEPLER REPENTS INSTANTLY AND REPLIES MOST NOBLE TYCHO THESE ARE THE WORDS OF HIS LETTER
3032-19361-0037 HOW SHALL I ENUMERATE OR RIGHTLY ESTIMATE YOUR BENEFITS CONFERRED ON ME FOR TWO MONTHS YOU HAVE LIBERALLY AND GRATUITOUSLY MAINTAINED ME AND MY WHOLE FAMILY YOU HAVE PROVIDED FOR ALL MY WISHES
3032-19361-0039 YOUR WIFE OR YOURSELF HAVE YOU SHOWN MORE INDULGENCE THAN TO ME THIS BEING SO AS I AM ANXIOUS TO PUT ON RECORD I CANNOT REFLECT WITHOUT CONSTERNATION
3032-19361-0040 THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO GIVEN UP BY GOD TO MY OWN INTEMPERANCE AS TO SHUT MY EYES ON ALL THESE BENEFITS THAT INSTEAD OF MODEST AND RESPECTFUL GRATITUDE I SHOULD INDULGE FOR THREE WEEKS IN CONTINUAL
3032-19361-0041 MOROSENESS TOWARDS ALL YOUR FAMILY IN HEADLONG PASSION AND THE UTMOST INSOLENCE TOWARDS YOURSELF WHO POSSESS SO MANY CLAIMS ON MY VENERATION FROM YOUR NOBLE FAMILY YOUR EXTRAORDINARY LEARNING
3032-19361-0042 AND DISTINGUISHED REPUTATION WHATEVER I HAVE SAID OR WRITTEN AGAINST THE PERSON THE FAME THE HONOUR AND THE LEARNING OF YOUR EXCELLENCY OR WHATEVER IN ANY OTHER WAY I HAVE INJURIOUSLY SPOKEN OR WRITTEN
3032-19361-0043 IN SIXTEEN O ONE KEPLER WAS APPOINTED IMPERIAL MATHEMATICIAN TO ASSIST TYCHO IN HIS CALCULATIONS THE EMPEROR RUDOLPH DID A GOOD PIECE OF WORK IN THUS MAINTAINING THESE TWO EMINENT MEN BUT IT IS QUITE CLEAR
3032-19361-0044 THAT IT WAS AS ASTROLOGERS THAT HE VALUED THEM AND ALL HE CARED FOR IN THE PLANETARY MOTIONS WAS LIMITED TO THEIR SUPPOSED EFFECT ON HIS OWN AND HIS KINGDOM'S DESTINY
3032-19361-0045 AND THE TABLES UPON WHICH TYCHO WAS NOW ENGAGED ARE WELL CALLED THE RUDOLPHINE TABLES THESE TABLES OF PLANETARY MOTION TYCHO HAD ALWAYS REGARDED AS THE MAIN WORK OF HIS LIFE BUT HE DIED BEFORE THEY WERE FINISHED
3032-19361-0046 AND ON HIS DEATH BED HE INTRUSTED THE COMPLETION OF THEM TO KEPLER WHO LOYALLY UNDERTOOK THEIR CHARGE THE IMPERIAL FUNDS WERE BY THIS TIME HOWEVER SO TAXED BY WARS AND OTHER DIFFICULTIES
3032-19361-0047 AND DRAFTS ON ESTATES FOR IT BUT WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR THEM TO BE HONOURED THEY WERE WORTHLESS AND HE HAD NO POWER TO ENFORCE HIS CLAIMS SO EVERYTHING BUT BROODING HAD TO BE ABANDONED AS TOO EXPENSIVE
3032-19361-0048 AND HE PROCEEDED TO STUDY OPTICS HE GAVE A VERY ACCURATE EXPLANATION OF THE ACTION OF THE HUMAN EYE AND MADE MANY HYPOTHESES SOME OF THEM SHREWD AND CLOSE TO THE MARK CONCERNING THE LAW OF REFRACTION OF LIGHT IN DENSE MEDIA
3032-19361-0049 BUT THOUGH SEVERAL MINOR POINTS OF INTEREST TURNED UP NOTHING OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE CAME OUT OF THIS LONG RESEARCH THE TRUE LAW OF REFRACTION WAS DISCOVERED SOME YEARS AFTER BY A DUTCH PROFESSOR
3032-19361-0050 WILLEBROD SNELL WE MUST NOW DEVOTE A LITTLE TIME TO THE MAIN WORK OF KEPLER'S LIFE ALL THE TIME HE HAD BEEN AT PRAGUE HE HAD BEEN MAKING A SEVERE STUDY OF THE MOTION OF THE PLANET MARS
3032-19361-0051 THE PLANETS DID NOT REVOLVE IN SIMPLE CIRCLES THEY DID NOT TRY OTHER CURVES AS WE SHOULD AT ONCE DO NOW BUT THEY TRIED COMBINATIONS OF CIRCLES
3032-19361-0052 HENCE WAS INTRODUCED THE IDEA OF AN EQUANT
3032-19361-0053 AN ARBITRARY POINT NOT THE EARTH ABOUT WHICH THE SPEED MIGHT BE UNIFORM COPERNICUS BY MAKING THE SUN THE CENTRE HAD BEEN ABLE TO SIMPLIFY A GOOD DEAL OF THIS
3032-19361-0054 AND TO ABOLISH THE EQUANT BUT NOW THAT KEPLER HAD THE ACCURATE OBSERVATIONS OF TYCHO TO REFER TO HE FOUND IMMENSE DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING THE TRUE POSITIONS OF THE PLANETS
3032-19361-0055 FOR A CONSIDERABLE COLLECTION OF DATA TO HAVE ACCUMULATED WITH RESPECT TO IT HE TRIED ALL MANNER OF CIRCULAR ORBITS FOR THE EARTH AND FOR MARS PLACING THEM IN ALL SORTS OF ASPECTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SUN
3032-19361-0056 BOTH BEING SUPPOSED EXCENTRIC WITH RESPECT TO THE SUN BUT HE COULD NOT GET ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENT TO WORK WITH UNIFORM MOTION ABOUT THE SUN SO HE REINTRODUCED THE EQUANT
3032-19361-0057 AND THUS HAD ANOTHER VARIABLE AT HIS DISPOSAL IN FACT TWO FOR HE HAD AN EQUANT FOR THE EARTH AND ANOTHER FOR MARS GETTING A PATTERN OF THE KIND SUGGESTED IN FIG TWENTY NINE
3032-19361-0058 THE EQUANTS MIGHT DIVIDE THE LINE IN ANY ARBITRARY RATIO ALL SORTS OF COMBINATIONS HAD TO BE TRIED THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE EARTH AND MARS TO BE WORKED OUT FOR EACH
3032-19361-0059 WITH UNEXAMPLED DILIGENCE AT LENGTH HE HIT UPON A POINT THAT SEEMED NEARLY RIGHT HE THOUGHT HE HAD FOUND THE TRUTH BUT NO BEFORE LONG THE POSITION OF THE PLANET AS CALCULATED
3032-19361-0060 AND AS RECORDED BY TYCHO
3032-19361-0061 OR ABOUT ONE EIGHTH OF A DEGREE
3032-19361-0062 HE WOULD YET FIND OUT THE LAW OF THE UNIVERSE HE PROCEEDED TO SEE IF BY MAKING THE PLANET LIBRATE OR THE PLANE OF ITS ORBIT TILT UP AND DOWN ANYTHING COULD BE DONE
3032-19361-0063 HE WAS REWARDED BY FINDING THAT AT ANY RATE THE PLANE OF THE ORBIT DID NOT TILT UP AND DOWN IT WAS FIXED
3032-19361-0064 HE DIVIDED THE ORBIT INTO TRIANGLES AND TRIED IF MAKING THE TRIANGLES EQUAL WOULD DO A GREAT PIECE OF LUCK THEY DID BEAUTIFULLY THE RATE OF DESCRIPTION OF AREAS NOT ARCS
3032-19361-0065 FRESH LITTLE ERRORS APPEARED AND GREW IN IMPORTANCE THUS HE ANNOUNCES IT HIMSELF WHILE THUS TRIUMPHING OVER MARS AND PREPARING FOR HIM AS FOR ONE ALREADY VANQUISHED
3032-19361-0066 A DESPISED CAPTIVE HAS BURST ALL THE CHAINS OF THE EQUATIONS AND BROKEN FORTH FROM THE PRISONS OF THE TABLES STILL A PART OF THE TRUTH HAD BEEN GAINED
3032-19361-0067 AND EVERY PHILOSOPHER SINCE ARISTOTLE HAD BEEN WRONG THAT CIRCULAR MOTION WAS NOT THE PERFECT AND NATURAL MOTION BUT THAT PLANETS MIGHT MOVE IN SOME OTHER CLOSED CURVE
3032-19361-0068 SUPPOSE HE TRIED AN OVAL WELL THERE ARE A GREAT VARIETY OF OVALS AND SEVERAL WERE TRIED WITH THE RESULT THAT THEY COULD BE MADE TO ANSWER BETTER THAN A CIRCLE BUT STILL WERE NOT RIGHT
3032-19361-0069 NOW HOWEVER THE GEOMETRICAL AND MATHEMATICAL DIFFICULTIES OF CALCULATION WHICH BEFORE HAD BEEN TEDIOUS AND OPPRESSIVE THREATENED TO BECOME OVERWHELMING
3032-19361-0070 THAT WHEN HE MADE THE CIRCUIT OVAL HIS LAW OF EQUABLE DESCRIPTION OF AREAS BROKE DOWN THAT SEEMED TO REQUIRE THE CIRCULAR ORBIT AND YET NO CIRCULAR ORBIT WAS QUITE ACCURATE
3032-19361-0071 AND HE REMEMBERED THAT THE OPTICAL INEQUALITY OF MARS
3032-19361-0072 THIS COINCIDENCE IN HIS OWN WORDS WOKE HIM OUT OF SLEEP AND FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER IMPELLED HIM INSTANTLY TO TRY MAKING THE PLANET OSCILLATE IN THE DIAMETER OF ITS EPICYCLE
3032-19361-0073 STRANGE THAT HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE IT WAS A FAMOUS CURVE FOR THE GREEK GEOMETERS HAD STUDIED IT AS ONE OF THE SECTIONS OF A CONE BUT IT WAS NOT SO WELL KNOWN IN KEPLER'S TIME
3032-19361-0074 IF THE SUN WAS IN ONE FOCUS SO MOVING THE PLANET IN A SELECTED ELLIPSE WITH THE SUN IN ONE FOCUS AT A SPEED GIVEN BY THE EQUABLE AREA DESCRIPTION
3032-19361-0075 OF THE STEPS BY WHICH KEPLER ROSE TO HIS GREAT GENERALIZATIONS THE TWO LAWS WHICH HAVE IMMORTALIZED HIS NAME ALL THE COMPLICATIONS OF EPICYCLE EQUANT DEFERENT EXCENTRIC
3032-19361-0076 HE HAD BEEN THERE ELEVEN YEARS BUT THEY HAD BEEN HARD YEARS OF POVERTY AND HE COULD LEAVE WITHOUT REGRET
3032-19361-0077 BUT IT WAS THE ONLY THING FOR WHICH PEOPLE WOULD PAY HIM AND ON IT AFTER A FASHION HE LIVED WE DO NOT FIND THAT HIS CIRCUMSTANCES WERE EVER PROSPEROUS
3032-19361-0078 AND THOUGH EIGHT THOUSAND CROWNS WERE DUE TO HIM FROM BOHEMIA HE COULD NOT MANAGE TO GET THEM PAID ABOUT THIS TIME OCCURRED A SINGULAR INTERRUPTION TO HIS WORK HIS OLD MOTHER
3032-19361-0079 OF WHOSE FIERCE TEMPER SOMETHING HAS ALREADY BEEN INDICATED HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN A LAW SUIT FOR SOME YEARS NEAR THEIR OLD HOME
3032-19361-0080 A CHANGE OF JUDGE HAVING IN PROCESS OF TIME OCCURRED THE DEFENDANT SAW HIS WAY TO TURN THE TABLES ON THE OLD LADY BY ACCUSING HER OF SORCERY SHE WAS SENT TO PRISON AND CONDEMNED TO THE TORTURE
3032-19361-0081 WITH THE USUAL INTELLIGENT IDEA OF EXTRACTING A VOLUNTARY CONFESSION KEPLER HAD TO HURRY FROM LINZ TO INTERPOSE HE SUCCEEDED IN SAVING HER FROM THE TORTURE
3032-19361-0082 HER SPIRIT HOWEVER WAS UNBROKEN FOR NO SOONER WAS SHE RELEASED THAN SHE COMMENCED A FRESH ACTION AGAINST HER ACCUSER BUT FRESH TROUBLE WAS AVERTED BY THE DEATH OF THE POOR OLD DAME
3032-19361-0083 AT THE AGE OF NEARLY EIGHTY THIS NARRATION RENDERS THE UNFLAGGING ENERGY SHOWN BY HER SON IN HIS MATHEMATICAL WRESTLINGS LESS SURPRISING INTERSPERSED WITH THESE DOMESTIC TROUBLES
3032-19361-0084 IT MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN THAT THERE WAS NO CONNECTION THAT IT WAS PURELY IMAGINARY LIKE HIS OLD IDEA OF THE LAW OF THE SUCCESSIVE DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS AND LIKE SO MANY OTHERS OF THE GUESSES AND FANCIES
3032-19361-0085 OF ITS DISTANCE FROM THE SUN OR ONCE MORE THE SPEED OF EACH PLANET IN ITS ORBIT IS AS THE INVERSE SQUARE ROOT OF ITS DISTANCE FROM THE SUN THE PRODUCT OF THE DISTANCE INTO THE SQUARE OF THE SPEED
3032-19361-0086 WHICH I NAMED BEFORE I WAS SURE OF MY DISCOVERY WHAT SIXTEEN YEARS AGO I URGED AS A THING TO BE SOUGHT
3032-19361-0087 BEYOND MY MOST SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS IT IS NOT EIGHTEEN MONTHS SINCE I GOT THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF LIGHT THREE MONTHS SINCE THE DAWN VERY FEW DAYS SINCE THE UNVEILED SUN
3032-19361-0088 MOST ADMIRABLE TO GAZE UPON BURST UPON ME NOTHING HOLDS ME I WILL INDULGE MY SACRED FURY I WILL TRIUMPH OVER MANKIND BY THE HONEST CONFESSION
3032-19361-0089 AS GOD HAS WAITED SIX THOUSAND YEARS FOR AN OBSERVER SOON AFTER THIS GREAT WORK HIS THIRD BOOK APPEARED IT WAS AN EPITOME OF THE COPERNICAN THEORY
3032-19361-0090 A CLEAR AND FAIRLY POPULAR EXPOSITION OF IT WHICH HAD THE HONOUR OF BEING AT ONCE SUPPRESSED AND PLACED ON THE LIST OF BOOKS PROHIBITED BY THE CHURCH SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE WORK OF COPERNICUS HIMSELF
3032-19361-0091 TO UNDERTAKE ANOTHER BOOK STILL HE WORKED ON AT THE RUDOLPHINE TABLES OF TYCHO AND ULTIMATELY WITH SOME SMALL HELP FROM VIENNA COMPLETED THEM BUT HE COULD NOT GET THE MEANS TO PRINT THEM
3032-19361-0092 THEY WERE THE FIRST REALLY ACCURATE TABLES WHICH NAVIGATORS EVER POSSESSED THEY WERE THE PRECURSORS OF OUR PRESENT NAUTICAL ALMANACK AFTER THIS THE GRAND DUKE OF TUSCANY
3032-19361-0093 ATTENDED THE IMPERIAL MEETING AND PLEADED HIS OWN CAUSE BUT IT WAS ALL FRUITLESS AND EXHAUSTED BY THE JOURNEY WEAKENED BY OVER STUDY AND DISHEARTENED BY THE FAILURE HE CAUGHT A FEVER
3032-19361-0094 AND DIED IN HIS FIFTY NINTH YEAR HIS BODY WAS BURIED AT RATISBON AND A CENTURY AGO A PROPOSAL WAS MADE TO ERECT A MARBLE MONUMENT TO HIS MEMORY BUT NOTHING WAS DONE
3032-19361-0095 IT MATTERS LITTLE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHETHER GERMANY HAVING ALMOST REFUSED HIM BREAD DURING HIS LIFE SHOULD
3032-19361-0096 THE TOOLS BY WHICH HE DID HIS WORK WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM FREDERICK AND SOPHIA OF DENMARK AND RUDOLPH OF BOHEMIA ARE THEREFORE TO BE REMEMBERED AS CO WORKERS WITH HIM KEPLER
3032-19361-0097 WITH HIS ILL HEALTH AND INFERIOR PHYSICAL ENERGY WAS UNABLE TO COMMAND THE LIKE ADVANTAGES MUCH NEVERTHELESS HE DID MORE ONE CANNOT BUT FEEL HE MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD HE BEEN PROPERLY HELPED
3032-19361-0098 OF ALL THE STEPS UNSUCCESSFUL AS WELL AS SUCCESSFUL BY WHICH HE TRAVELLED HE MAPS OUT HIS ROUTE LIKE A TRAVELLER IN FACT HE COMPARES HIMSELF TO COLUMBUS OR MAGELLAN
3032-19361-0099 VOYAGING INTO UNKNOWN LANDS AND RECORDING HIS WANDERING ROUTE THIS BEING REMEMBERED IT WILL BE FOUND THAT HIS METHODS DO NOT DIFFER SO UTTERLY FROM THOSE USED BY OTHER PHILOSOPHERS IN LIKE CASE
3032-19361-0100 HIS IMAGINATION WAS PERHAPS MORE LUXURIANT AND WAS ALLOWED FREER PLAY THAN MOST MEN'S BUT IT WAS NEVERTHELESS ALWAYS CONTROLLED BY RIGID EXAMINATION
3032-19361-0101 AND COMPARISON OF HYPOTHESES WITH FACT BREWSTER SAYS OF HIM ARDENT RESTLESS BURNING TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF BY DISCOVERY HE ATTEMPTED EVERYTHING
3032-19361-0102 AND ONCE HAVING OBTAINED A GLIMPSE OF A CLUE NO LABOUR WAS TOO HARD IN FOLLOWING OR VERIFYING IT A FEW OF HIS ATTEMPTS SUCCEEDED A MULTITUDE FAILED
3032-19361-0103 THOSE WHICH FAILED SEEM TO US NOW FANCIFUL THOSE WHICH SUCCEEDED APPEAR TO US SUBLIME BUT HIS METHODS WERE THE SAME WHEN IN SEARCH OF WHAT REALLY EXISTED HE SOMETIMES FOUND IT
3032-19361-0104 IT IS NECESSARY FOR US NOW TO CONSIDER SOME SCIENCE STILL IN ITS INFANCY ASTRONOMY IS SO CLEAR AND SO THOROUGHLY EXPLORED NOW THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO PUT ONESELF INTO A CONTEMPORARY ATTITUDE
3032-19361-0105 TO SUPERNATURAL AGENCY WE HAVE HAD OUR COPERNICAN ERA NOT PERHAPS BROUGHT ABOUT BY A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL BUT STILL ACHIEVED
3032-19361-0106 AND RUDE WEATHER PREDICTIONS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC ARE ROUGHLY POSSIBLE BAROMETERS AND THERMOMETERS AND ANEMOMETERS AND ALL THEIR TRIBE REPRESENT THE ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE ISLAND OF HUEN
3032-19361-0107 AND OUR NUMEROUS METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATORIES WITH THEIR CONTINUAL RECORD OF EVENTS
3032-19361-0108 OBSERVATION IS HEAPED ON OBSERVATION TABLES ARE COMPILED VOLUMES ARE FILLED WITH DATA THE HOURS OF SUNSHINE ARE RECORDED THE FALL OF RAIN
3032-19361-0109 IN EVOLVING THE BEGINNINGS OF LAW AND ORDER FROM THE MIDST OF ALL THIS CHAOS PERHAPS AS A MAN HE MAY NOT COME BUT HIS ERA WILL COME THROUGH THIS STAGE THE SCIENCE MUST PASS
3032-19361-0110 ERE IT IS READY FOR THE COMMANDING INTELLECT OF A NEWTON BUT WHAT A WORK IT WILL BE FOR THE MAN WHOEVER HE BE THAT UNDERTAKES IT A FEARFUL MONOTONOUS GRIND OF CALCULATION
3032-19361-0111 HYPOTHESIS HYPOTHESIS CALCULATION A DESPERATE AND GROPING ENDEAVOUR TO RECONCILE THEORIES WITH FACTS A LIFE OF SUCH LABOUR CROWNED BY THREE BRILLIANT DISCOVERIES
3328-166436-0000 YOU LOVE US AS THE WHEAT FIELD LOVES THE HAIL WE ARE AS WELCOME TO YOU AS THE DEATH CORD TO THE CONDEMNED LO A DOOR OPENED INTO A LAND OF UNPLEASANT DREAMS YOU THOUGHT SEALED AND WE CAME THROUGH
3328-166436-0001 ANSWER MY QUESTIONS TRUTHFULLY AND IT MAY BE THAT WE SHALL RETURN THROUGH THAT DOOR INTEREST WELLED UP IN THE DEPTHS OF THE BLACK EYES
3328-166436-0002 HE MUTTERED NOR DOES IT PASS THROUGH THEM I CAN SHOW IT TO YOU I HAD NOT BEEN BLIND TO THE FLASH OF MALICE OF CUNNING THAT HAD SHOT ACROSS THE WRINKLED FACE
3328-166436-0003 THE LASHLESS LIDS HALF CLOSED YES HE SAID SULLENLY
3328-166436-0004 TO THEIR PLACE BUT WILL IT NOT BE SAFER FOR YOU THERE AMONG YOUR KIND I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WILL I ANSWERED PROMPTLY THOSE WHO ARE UNLIKE US
3328-166436-0005 HE SAID IF YOU GAVE THEM HER HE THRUST A LONG THUMB BACKWARD TOWARD SLEEPING RUTH CHERKIS WOULD FORGIVE MUCH FOR HER AND WHY SHOULD YOU NOT
3328-166436-0006 SHE IS ONLY A WOMAN HE SPAT IN A WAY THAT MADE ME WANT TO KILL HIM BESIDES HE ENDED HAVE YOU NO ARTS TO AMUSE HIM CHERKIS I ASKED
3328-166436-0007 IS YURUK A FOOL NOT TO KNOW THAT IN THE WORLD WITHOUT
3328-166436-0008 WHAT HAVE YOU TO BEGUILE CHERKIS BEYOND THIS WOMAN FLESH MUCH I THINK GO THEN TO HIM UNAFRAID CHERKIS
3328-166436-0009 THERE WAS A FAMILIAR SOUND TO THAT CHERKIS OF COURSE IT WAS THE NAME OF XERXES THE PERSIAN CONQUEROR CORRUPTED BY TIME INTO THIS CHERKIS AND ISKANDER
3328-166436-0010 EQUALLY OF COURSE ALEXANDER VENTNOR HAD BEEN RIGHT YURUK I DEMANDED DIRECTLY IS SHE WHOM YOU CALL GODDESS NORHALA OF THE PEOPLE OF CHERKIS
3328-166436-0011 HE ANSWERED LONG LONG AGO THERE WAS TROUBLE IN THEIR CITY EVEN IN THE GREAT DWELLING PLACE OF CHERKIS I FLED WITH HER WHO WAS THE MOTHER OF THE GODDESS THERE WERE TWENTY OF US AND WE FLED HERE
3328-166436-0012 HE WENT ON BUT AFTER A TIME SHE GREW OLD AND UGLY AND WITHERED SO HE SLEW HER LIKE A LITTLE MOUND OF DUST SHE DANCED AND BLEW AWAY AFTER HE HAD SLAIN HER
3328-166436-0013 AND ALSO HE SLEW OTHERS WHO HAD GROWN DISPLEASING TO HIM HE BLASTED ME AS HE WAS BLASTED HE POINTED TO VENTNOR
3328-166436-0014 WAS NOT THE FATHER OF ISKANDER THE GOD ZEUS AMMON WHO CAME TO ISKANDER'S MOTHER IN THE FORM OF A GREAT SNAKE
3328-166436-0015 AT ANY RATE THE GODDESS WAS BORN SHEDDER OF THE LIGHTNINGS EVEN FROM HER BIRTH
3328-166436-0016 CLEAVE TO YOUR KIND CLEAVE TO YOUR KIND SUDDENLY HE SHRILLED
3328-166436-0017 I WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY TO THEM HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET CLASPED MY WRIST IN ONE OF HIS LONG HANDS LED ME THROUGH THE CURTAINED OVAL INTO THE CYLINDRICAL HALL
3328-166436-0018 AN OVOID SLICE OF THE GEMLIKE MATERIAL SLID ASIDE REVEALING A DOORWAY I GLIMPSED A PATH A TRAIL LEADING INTO A FOREST PALLID GREEN BENEATH THE WAN LIGHT
3328-166436-0019 FOLLOW IT HE POINTED TAKE THOSE WHO CAME WITH YOU AND FOLLOW IT
3328-166436-0020 YOU WILL TAKE THEM AND GO BY THAT PATH NOT YET I ANSWERED ABSENTLY NOT YET AND WAS BROUGHT ABRUPTLY TO FULL ALERTNESS VIGILANCE
3328-166436-0021 I FOLLOWED WONDERING WHAT WERE THE SOURCES OF THE BITTER HATRED HE SO PLAINLY BORE FOR US THE REASONS FOR HIS EAGERNESS TO BE RID OF US DESPITE THE COMMANDS OF THIS WOMAN WHO TO HIM AT LEAST WAS GODDESS
3328-166436-0022 AND BY THAT CURIOUS HUMAN HABIT OF SEEKING FOR THE COMPLEX WHEN THE SIMPLE ANSWER LIES CLOSE FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT WAS JEALOUSY OF US THAT WAS THE ROOT OF HIS BEHAVIOR
3328-166436-0023 THAT HE WISHED TO BE AS IT WOULD SEEM HE HAD BEEN FOR YEARS THE ONLY HUMAN THING NEAR NORHALA FAILED TO REALIZE THIS AND WITH RUTH AND DRAKE WAS TERRIBLY TO PAY FOR THIS FAILURE
3328-166436-0024 I LOOKED DOWN UPON THE PAIR SLEEPING SOUNDLY UPON VENTNOR LOST STILL IN TRANCE SIT I ORDERED THE EUNUCH AND TURN YOUR BACK TO ME I DROPPED DOWN BESIDE DRAKE
3328-166436-0025 NOW I FACED IT KNOWING IT TO BE THE VERY CRUX OF THESE INCREDIBLE PHENOMENA ADMITTING TOO THAT DESPITE ALL MY SPECIAL PLEADING ABOUT THAT POINT SWIRLED IN MY OWN MIND THE THICKEST MISTS OF
3328-166436-0026 UNCERTAINTY THAT THEIR SENSE OF ORDER WAS IMMENSELY BEYOND A MAN'S WAS PLAIN AS PLAIN WAS IT THAT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF MAGNETIC FORCE AND ITS MANIPULATION WERE FAR BEYOND THE SPHERE OF HUMANITY
3328-166436-0027 AND NO HUMAN IMAGINATION COULD HAVE CONCEIVED IT NOR HUMAN HANDS HAVE MADE ITS THOUGHT OF BEAUTY REAL WHAT WERE THEIR SENSES THROUGH WHICH THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS FED
3328-166436-0028 NINE IN NUMBER HAD BEEN THE SAPPHIRE OVALS SET WITHIN THE GOLDEN ZONE OF THE DISK CLEARLY IT CAME TO ME THAT THESE WERE SENSE ORGANS BUT NINE SENSES
3328-166436-0029 AND THE GREAT STARS HOW MANY HAD THEY AND THE CUBES DID THEY OPEN AS DID GLOBE AND PYRAMID CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF AFTER ALL WHAT IS IT A SECRETION OF THE BRAIN
3328-166436-0030 THE CUMULATIVE EXPRESSION WHOLLY CHEMICAL OF THE MULTITUDES OF CELLS THAT FORM US THE INEXPLICABLE GOVERNOR OF THE CITY OF THE BODY OF WHICH
3328-166436-0031 A SELF REALIZING FORCE WHICH USES THE BODY AS ITS VEHICLE JUST AS OTHER FORCES USE FOR THEIR VESTMENTS OTHER MACHINES AFTER ALL I THOUGHT WHAT IS THIS CONSCIOUS SELF OF OURS
3328-166436-0032 THE EGO BUT A SPARK OF REALIZATION RUNNING CONTINUOUSLY ALONG THE PATH OF TIME WITHIN THE MECHANISM WE CALL THE BRAIN MAKING CONTACT ALONG THAT PATH AS THE ELECTRIC SPARK AT THE END OF A WIRE
3328-166436-0033 LIMITED IN ITS EXPRESSION ONLY BY THE LIMITATIONS OF THAT WHICH ANIMATES AND IN ESSENCE THE SAME IN ALL IF SO
3328-166436-0034 CEASED TO BE A PROBLEM WAS ANSWERED SO THINKING I BECAME AWARE OF INCREASING LIGHT STRODE PAST YURUK TO THE DOOR AND PEEPED OUT DAWN WAS PALING THE SKY
3328-166436-0035 WHY IT'S DAWN HE WHISPERED GOODWIN YOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE LET ME SLEEP SO LONG I FEEL LIKE A DAMNED PIG NEVER MIND I SAID BUT WATCH THE EUNUCH CLOSELY
3328-168626-0000 THE LITTLE ONE ALL ALONE AS THE THENARDIER HOSTELRY WAS IN THAT PART OF THE VILLAGE WHICH IS NEAR THE CHURCH IT WAS TO THE SPRING IN THE FOREST IN THE DIRECTION OF CHELLES THAT COSETTE WAS OBLIGED TO GO FOR HER WATER
3328-168626-0001 SHE MADE AS MUCH MOTION AS POSSIBLE WITH THE HANDLE OF THE BUCKET AS SHE WALKED ALONG THIS MADE A NOISE WHICH AFFORDED HER COMPANY THE FURTHER SHE WENT THE DENSER THE DARKNESS BECAME THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE STREETS
3328-168626-0002 HOWEVER SHE DID ENCOUNTER A WOMAN WHO TURNED AROUND ON SEEING HER
3328-168626-0003 IS IT A WEREWOLF CHILD THEN THE WOMAN RECOGNIZED COSETTE WELL SAID SHE IT'S THE LARK
3328-168626-0004 SO LONG AS SHE HAD THE HOUSES OR EVEN THE WALLS ONLY ON BOTH SIDES OF HER PATH SHE PROCEEDED WITH TOLERABLE BOLDNESS FROM TIME TO TIME SHE CAUGHT THE FLICKER OF A CANDLE THROUGH THE CRACK OF A SHUTTER THIS WAS LIGHT AND LIFE
3328-168626-0005 THERE WERE PEOPLE THERE AND IT REASSURED HER BUT IN PROPORTION AS SHE ADVANCED HER PACE SLACKENED MECHANICALLY AS IT WERE WHEN SHE HAD PASSED THE CORNER OF THE LAST HOUSE COSETTE PAUSED
3328-168626-0006 IT HAD BEEN HARD TO ADVANCE FURTHER THAN THE LAST STALL IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED FURTHER THAN THE LAST HOUSE SHE SET HER BUCKET ON THE GROUND THRUST HER HAND INTO HER HAIR AND BEGAN SLOWLY TO SCRATCH HER HEAD
3328-168626-0007 A GESTURE PECULIAR TO CHILDREN WHEN TERRIFIED AND UNDECIDED WHAT TO DO
3328-168626-0008 IT WAS THE OPEN FIELDS BLACK AND DESERT SPACE WAS BEFORE HER SHE GAZED IN DESPAIR AT THAT DARKNESS WHERE THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ONE WHERE THERE WERE BEASTS
3328-168626-0009 WHERE THERE WERE SPECTRES POSSIBLY SHE TOOK A GOOD LOOK AND HEARD THE BEASTS WALKING ON THE GRASS AND SHE DISTINCTLY SAW SPECTRES MOVING IN THE TREES THEN SHE SEIZED HER BUCKET AGAIN
3328-168626-0010 FEAR HAD LENT HER AUDACITY BAH SAID SHE I WILL TELL HIM THAT THERE WAS NO MORE WATER
3328-168626-0011 HARDLY HAD SHE GONE A HUNDRED PACES WHEN SHE PAUSED AND BEGAN TO SCRATCH HER HEAD AGAIN NOW IT WAS THE THENARDIER WHO APPEARED TO HER WITH HER HIDEOUS HYENA MOUTH AND WRATH FLASHING IN HER EYES
3328-168626-0012 THE CHILD CAST A MELANCHOLY GLANCE BEFORE HER AND BEHIND HER WHAT WAS SHE TO DO WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF HER WHERE WAS SHE TO GO IN FRONT OF HER WAS THE SPECTRE OF THE THENARDIER
3328-168626-0013 SHE ENTERED THE FOREST AT A RUN NO LONGER LOOKING AT OR LISTENING TO ANYTHING SHE ONLY PAUSED IN HER COURSE WHEN HER BREATH FAILED HER BUT SHE DID NOT HALT IN HER ADVANCE SHE WENT STRAIGHT BEFORE HER IN DESPERATION
3328-168626-0014 AS SHE RAN SHE FELT LIKE CRYING THE NOCTURNAL QUIVERING OF THE FOREST SURROUNDED HER COMPLETELY SHE NO LONGER THOUGHT SHE NO LONGER SAW THE IMMENSITY OF NIGHT WAS FACING THIS TINY CREATURE
3328-168626-0015 ON THE ONE HAND ALL SHADOW ON THE OTHER AN ATOM IT WAS ONLY SEVEN OR EIGHT MINUTES WALK FROM THE EDGE OF THE WOODS TO THE SPRING COSETTE KNEW THE WAY THROUGH HAVING GONE OVER IT MANY TIMES IN DAYLIGHT
3328-168626-0016 STRANGE TO SAY SHE DID NOT GET LOST A REMNANT OF INSTINCT GUIDED HER VAGUELY BUT SHE DID NOT TURN HER EYES EITHER TO RIGHT OR TO LEFT FOR FEAR OF SEEING THINGS IN THE BRANCHES AND IN THE BRUSHWOOD
3328-168626-0017 IN THIS MANNER SHE REACHED THE SPRING IT WAS A NARROW NATURAL BASIN HOLLOWED OUT BY THE WATER IN A CLAYEY SOIL ABOUT TWO FEET DEEP
3328-168626-0018 AND PAVED WITH SEVERAL LARGE STONES A BROOK RAN OUT OF IT WITH A TRANQUIL LITTLE NOISE COSETTE DID NOT TAKE TIME TO BREATHE IT WAS VERY DARK BUT SHE WAS IN THE HABIT OF COMING TO THIS SPRING
3328-168626-0019 FOUND ONE OF ITS BRANCHES CLUNG TO IT
3328-168626-0020 SHE WAS IN A STATE OF SUCH VIOLENT EXCITEMENT THAT HER STRENGTH WAS TREBLED WHILE THUS BENT OVER SHE DID NOT NOTICE THAT THE POCKET OF HER APRON HAD EMPTIED ITSELF INTO THE SPRING
3328-168626-0021 COSETTE NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD IT FALL SHE DREW OUT THE BUCKET NEARLY FULL AND SET IT ON THE GRASS THAT DONE SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE
3328-168626-0022 SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SET OUT AGAIN AT ONCE BUT THE EFFORT REQUIRED TO FILL THE BUCKET HAD BEEN SUCH THAT SHE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A STEP SHE WAS FORCED TO SIT DOWN SHE DROPPED ON THE GRASS AND REMAINED CROUCHING THERE
3328-168626-0023 WITHOUT KNOWING WHY BUT BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THE AGITATED WATER IN THE BUCKET BESIDE HER WAS DESCRIBING CIRCLES WHICH RESEMBLED TIN SERPENTS OVERHEAD THE SKY WAS COVERED WITH VAST BLACK CLOUDS
3328-168626-0025 WITH WHICH SHE WAS UNFAMILIAR AND WHICH TERRIFIED HER THE PLANET WAS IN FACT VERY NEAR THE HORIZON AND WAS TRAVERSING A DENSE LAYER OF MIST WHICH IMPARTED TO IT A HORRIBLE RUDDY HUE
3328-168626-0026 THE MIST GLOOMILY EMPURPLED MAGNIFIED THE STAR ONE WOULD HAVE CALLED IT A LUMINOUS WOUND A COLD WIND WAS BLOWING FROM THE PLAIN THE FOREST WAS DARK NOT A LEAF WAS MOVING
3328-168626-0027 THERE WERE NONE OF THE VAGUE FRESH GLEAMS OF SUMMERTIDE GREAT BOUGHS UPLIFTED THEMSELVES IN FRIGHTFUL WISE SLENDER AND MISSHAPEN BUSHES WHISTLED IN THE CLEARINGS THE TALL GRASSES UNDULATED LIKE EELS UNDER THE NORTH WIND
3328-168626-0028 THE NETTLES SEEMED TO TWIST LONG ARMS FURNISHED WITH CLAWS IN SEARCH OF PREY SOME BITS OF DRY HEATHER TOSSED BY THE BREEZE FLEW RAPIDLY BY AND HAD THE AIR OF FLEEING IN TERROR BEFORE SOMETHING WHICH WAS COMING AFTER
3328-168626-0029 ON ALL SIDES THERE WERE LUGUBRIOUS STRETCHES THE DARKNESS WAS BEWILDERING MAN REQUIRES LIGHT WHOEVER BURIES HIMSELF IN THE OPPOSITE OF DAY FEELS HIS HEART CONTRACT
3328-168626-0030 WHEN THE EYE SEES BLACK THE HEART SEES TROUBLE IN AN ECLIPSE IN THE NIGHT IN THE SOOTY OPACITY THERE IS ANXIETY EVEN FOR THE STOUTEST OF HEARTS NO ONE WALKS ALONE IN THE FOREST AT NIGHT WITHOUT TREMBLING
3328-168626-0031 SHADOWS AND TREES TWO FORMIDABLE DENSITIES
3328-168626-0032 APPEARS IN THE INDISTINCT DEPTHS THE INCONCEIVABLE IS OUTLINED A FEW PACES DISTANT FROM YOU WITH A SPECTRAL CLEARNESS ONE BEHOLDS FLOATING EITHER IN SPACE OR IN ONE'S OWN BRAIN
3328-168626-0033 ONE KNOWS NOT WHAT VAGUE AND INTANGIBLE THING LIKE THE DREAMS OF SLEEPING FLOWERS THERE ARE FIERCE ATTITUDES ON THE HORIZON
3328-168626-0034 ONE IS AFRAID TO GLANCE BEHIND HIM YET DESIROUS OF DOING SO THE CAVITIES OF NIGHT THINGS GROWN HAGGARD TACITURN PROFILES WHICH VANISH WHEN ONE ADVANCES OBSCURE DISHEVELMENTS IRRITATED TUFTS
3328-168626-0035 LIVID POOLS THE LUGUBRIOUS REFLECTED IN THE FUNEREAL
3328-168626-0036 OF SILENCE UNKNOWN BUT POSSIBLE BEINGS BENDINGS OF MYSTERIOUS BRANCHES ALARMING TORSOS OF TREES LONG HANDFULS OF QUIVERING PLANTS AGAINST ALL THIS ONE HAS NO PROTECTION
3328-168626-0037 THIS PENETRATION OF THE SHADOWS IS INDESCRIBABLY SINISTER IN THE CASE OF A CHILD
3328-168626-0038 WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING HER SENSATIONS COSETTE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT SHE WAS SEIZED UPON BY THAT BLACK ENORMITY OF NATURE IT WAS NO LONGER TERROR ALONE WHICH WAS GAINING POSSESSION OF HER IT WAS SOMETHING MORE TERRIBLE
3328-168626-0039 EVEN THAN TERROR SHE SHIVERED THERE ARE NO WORDS TO EXPRESS THE STRANGENESS OF THAT SHIVER
3328-168626-0040 THEN BY A SORT OF INSTINCT SHE BEGAN TO COUNT ALOUD ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND SO ON UP TO TEN IN ORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THAT SINGULAR STATE WHICH SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND BUT WHICH TERRIFIED HER
3328-168626-0041 AND WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE BEGAN AGAIN THIS RESTORED HER TO A TRUE PERCEPTION OF THE THINGS ABOUT HER HER HANDS WHICH SHE HAD WET IN DRAWING THE WATER FELT COLD SHE ROSE
3328-168626-0042 HER TERROR A NATURAL AND UNCONQUERABLE TERROR HAD RETURNED SHE HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT NOW TO FLEE AT FULL SPEED THROUGH THE FOREST ACROSS THE FIELDS TO THE HOUSES TO THE WINDOWS TO THE LIGHTED CANDLES
3328-168626-0043 HER GLANCE FELL UPON THE WATER WHICH STOOD BEFORE HER SUCH WAS THE FRIGHT WHICH THE THENARDIER INSPIRED IN HER THAT SHE DARED NOT FLEE WITHOUT THAT BUCKET OF WATER SHE SEIZED THE HANDLE WITH BOTH HANDS SHE COULD HARDLY LIFT THE PAIL
3328-168626-0044 IN THIS MANNER SHE ADVANCED A DOZEN PACES BUT THE BUCKET WAS FULL IT WAS HEAVY SHE WAS FORCED TO SET IT ON THE GROUND ONCE MORE SHE TOOK BREATH FOR AN INSTANT THEN LIFTED THE HANDLE OF THE BUCKET AGAIN
3328-168626-0045 AGAIN SHE WAS OBLIGED TO PAUSE AFTER SOME SECONDS OF REPOSE SHE SET OUT AGAIN SHE WALKED BENT FORWARD WITH DROOPING HEAD LIKE AN OLD WOMAN THE WEIGHT OF THE BUCKET STRAINED AND STIFFENED HER THIN ARMS
3328-168626-0046 THE IRON HANDLE COMPLETED THE BENUMBING AND FREEZING OF HER WET AND TINY HANDS SHE WAS FORCED TO HALT FROM TIME TO TIME AND EACH TIME THAT SHE DID SO THE COLD WATER WHICH SPLASHED FROM THE PAIL FELL ON HER BARE LEGS
3328-168626-0047 THIS TOOK PLACE IN THE DEPTHS OF A FOREST AT NIGHT IN WINTER FAR FROM ALL HUMAN SIGHT SHE WAS A CHILD OF EIGHT
3328-168626-0048 AND HER MOTHER NO DOUBT ALAS FOR THERE ARE THINGS THAT MAKE THE DEAD OPEN THEIR EYES IN THEIR GRAVES SHE PANTED WITH A SORT OF PAINFUL RATTLE SOBS CONTRACTED HER THROAT BUT SHE DARED NOT WEEP
3328-168626-0049 IN SPITE OF DIMINISHING THE LENGTH OF HER STOPS AND OF WALKING AS LONG AS POSSIBLE BETWEEN THEM
3328-168626-0050 AND THAT THE THENARDIER WOULD BEAT HER THIS ANGUISH WAS MINGLED WITH HER TERROR AT BEING ALONE IN THE WOODS AT NIGHT SHE WAS WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE AND HAD NOT YET EMERGED FROM THE FOREST
3328-168626-0051 ON ARRIVING NEAR AN OLD CHESTNUT TREE WITH WHICH SHE WAS ACQUAINTED MADE A LAST HALT LONGER THAN THE REST IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT GET WELL RESTED
3328-168626-0052 THEN SHE SUMMONED UP ALL HER STRENGTH PICKED UP HER BUCKET AGAIN AND COURAGEOUSLY RESUMED HER MARCH
3328-168626-0053 AT THAT MOMENT SHE SUDDENLY BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT HER BUCKET NO LONGER WEIGHED ANYTHING AT ALL A HAND WHICH SEEMED TO HER ENORMOUS HAD JUST SEIZED THE HANDLE AND LIFTED IT VIGOROUSLY SHE RAISED HER HEAD
3328-168626-0054 A LARGE BLACK FORM STRAIGHT AND ERECT WAS WALKING BESIDE HER THROUGH THE DARKNESS IT WAS A MAN WHO HAD COME UP BEHIND HER AND WHOSE APPROACH SHE HAD NOT HEARD THIS MAN WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HAD SEIZED THE HANDLE OF THE BUCKET WHICH SHE WAS CARRYING
3328-168626-0055 THERE ARE INSTINCTS FOR ALL THE ENCOUNTERS OF LIFE
3328-168638-0000 THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK WHO REGRETS THE NECESSITY OF MENTIONING HIMSELF HAS BEEN ABSENT FROM PARIS FOR MANY YEARS PARIS HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED SINCE HE QUITTED IT A NEW CITY HAS ARISEN WHICH IS AFTER A FASHION
3328-168638-0001 UNKNOWN TO HIM THERE IS NO NEED FOR HIM TO SAY THAT HE LOVES PARIS PARIS IS HIS MIND'S NATAL CITY IN CONSEQUENCE OF DEMOLITIONS AND RECONSTRUCTIONS
3328-168638-0002 THE PARIS OF HIS YOUTH THAT PARIS WHICH HE BORE AWAY RELIGIOUSLY IN HIS MEMORY IS NOW A PARIS OF DAYS GONE BY HE MUST BE PERMITTED TO SPEAK OF THAT PARIS AS THOUGH IT STILL EXISTED
3328-168638-0003 NEITHER STREET NOR HOUSE WILL ANY LONGER EXIST IN THAT LOCALITY READERS MAY VERIFY THE FACTS IF THEY CARE TO TAKE THE TROUBLE FOR HIS OWN PART
3328-168638-0004 HE IS UNACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW PARIS AND HE WRITES WITH THE OLD PARIS BEFORE HIS EYES IN AN ILLUSION WHICH IS PRECIOUS TO HIM IT IS A DELIGHT TO HIM TO DREAM THAT THERE STILL LINGERS BEHIND HIM SOMETHING OF THAT WHICH HE BEHELD
3328-168638-0005 WHEN HE WAS IN HIS OWN COUNTRY AND THAT ALL HAS NOT VANISHED SO LONG AS YOU GO AND COME IN YOUR NATIVE LAND YOU IMAGINE THAT THOSE STREETS ARE A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO YOU
3328-168638-0006 THAT THOSE WALLS ARE STRANGERS TO YOU THAT THOSE TREES ARE MERELY THE FIRST ENCOUNTERED HAPHAZARD THAT THOSE HOUSES WHICH YOU DO NOT ENTER ARE USELESS TO YOU THAT THE PAVEMENTS WHICH YOU TREAD ARE MERELY STONES
3328-168638-0007 LATER ON WHEN YOU ARE NO LONGER THERE YOU PERCEIVE THAT THE STREETS ARE DEAR TO YOU
3328-168638-0008 THOSE TREES ARE WELL BELOVED BY YOU THAT YOU ENTERED THOSE HOUSES WHICH YOU NEVER ENTERED EVERY DAY AND THAT YOU HAVE LEFT A PART OF YOUR HEART OF YOUR BLOOD OF YOUR SOUL IN THOSE PAVEMENTS
3328-168638-0009 ALL THOSE PLACES WHICH YOU NO LONGER BEHOLD WHICH YOU MAY NEVER BEHOLD AGAIN PERCHANCE AND WHOSE MEMORY YOU HAVE CHERISHED TAKE ON A MELANCHOLY CHARM RECUR TO YOUR MIND WITH THE MELANCHOLY OF AN APPARITION
3328-168638-0010 MAKE THE HOLY LAND VISIBLE TO YOU AND ARE SO TO SPEAK THE VERY FORM OF FRANCE AND YOU LOVE THEM AND YOU CALL THEM UP AS THEY ARE AS THEY WERE AND YOU PERSIST IN THIS AND YOU WILL SUBMIT TO NO CHANGE
3328-168638-0011 FOR YOU ARE ATTACHED TO THE FIGURE OF YOUR FATHERLAND AS TO THE FACE OF YOUR MOTHER MAY WE THEN BE PERMITTED TO SPEAK OF THE PAST IN THE PRESENT THAT SAID WE BEG THE READER TO TAKE NOTE OF IT
3328-168638-0012 THE MOON WAS FULL THAT NIGHT JEAN VALJEAN WAS NOT SORRY FOR THIS THE MOON STILL VERY CLOSE TO THE HORIZON CAST GREAT MASSES OF LIGHT AND SHADOW IN THE STREETS
3328-168638-0013 JEAN VALJEAN COULD GLIDE ALONG CLOSE TO THE HOUSES ON THE DARK SIDE AND YET KEEP WATCH ON THE LIGHT SIDE HE DID NOT PERHAPS TAKE SUFFICIENTLY INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT THE DARK SIDE ESCAPED HIM STILL
3328-168638-0014 MOREOVER AND THIS IS A REMARK TO WHICH WE SHALL FREQUENTLY HAVE OCCASION TO RECUR SHE HAD GROWN USED WITHOUT BEING HERSELF AWARE OF IT TO THE PECULIARITIES OF THIS GOOD MAN AND TO THE FREAKS OF DESTINY
3328-168638-0015 AND THEN SHE WAS WITH HIM AND SHE FELT SAFE JEAN VALJEAN KNEW NO MORE WHERE HE WAS GOING THAN DID COSETTE HE TRUSTED IN GOD AS SHE TRUSTED IN HIM
3328-168638-0016 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE ALSO WERE CLINGING TO THE HAND OF SOME ONE GREATER THAN HIMSELF HE THOUGHT HE FELT A BEING LEADING HIM THOUGH INVISIBLE HOWEVER HE HAD NO SETTLED IDEA NO PLAN NO PROJECT
3328-168638-0017 HE WAS NOT EVEN ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT IT WAS JAVERT AND THEN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN JAVERT WITHOUT JAVERT KNOWING THAT HE WAS JEAN VALJEAN WAS NOT HE DISGUISED WAS NOT HE BELIEVED TO BE DEAD
3328-168638-0018 AS THOUGH THE DISCIPLINE OF THE MIDDLE AGES AND THE YOKE OF THE CURFEW STILL EXISTED HE COMBINED IN VARIOUS MANNERS WITH CUNNING STRATEGY THE RUE CENSIER AND THE RUE COPEAU
3328-168638-0019 FINDING NOTHING WHICH SUITED HIM HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT IF ANY ONE HAD CHANCED TO BE UPON HIS TRACK THEY WOULD HAVE LOST IT
3328-168638-0020 THREE MEN WHO WERE FOLLOWING HIM CLOSELY PASS ONE AFTER THE OTHER UNDER THAT LANTERN ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE STREET ONE OF THE THREE ENTERED THE ALLEY LEADING TO THE COMMISSARY'S HOUSE
3328-168638-0021 THE ONE WHO MARCHED AT THEIR HEAD STRUCK HIM AS DECIDEDLY SUSPICIOUS COME CHILD HE SAID TO COSETTE AND HE MADE HASTE TO QUIT
3328-168638-0022 AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A SQUARE FORMED BY THE INTERSECTION OF STREETS
3328-168638-0023 STANDS TO DAY AND WHERE THE RUE
3328-168638-0024 TURNS OFF IT IS UNDERSTOOD OF COURSE THAT THE RUE
3328-168638-0025 THE MOON CAST A LIVID LIGHT INTO THIS OPEN SPACE
3328-168638-0026 HE COULD NOT FAIL TO GET A GOOD LOOK AT THEM AS THEY TRAVERSED THIS ILLUMINATED SPACE IN POINT OF FACT THREE MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED WHEN THE MEN MADE THEIR APPEARANCE THERE WERE FOUR OF THEM NOW
3328-168638-0027 ALL WERE TALL DRESSED IN LONG BROWN COATS WITH ROUND HATS AND HUGE CUDGELS IN THEIR HANDS THEIR GREAT STATURE AND THEIR VAST FISTS RENDERED THEM NO LESS ALARMING THAN DID THEIR SINISTER STRIDE THROUGH THE DARKNESS
3328-168638-0028 THE ONE WHO APPEARED TO BE THEIR LEADER TURNED ROUND AND POINTED HASTILY WITH HIS RIGHT HAND IN THE DIRECTION WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAD TAKEN ANOTHER SEEMED TO INDICATE THE CONTRARY DIRECTION WITH CONSIDERABLE OBSTINACY
3328-168638-0029 AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE FIRST MAN WHEELED ROUND THE MOON FELL FULL IN HIS FACE
3330-170956-0000 HERE ADEIMANTUS INTERPOSED A QUESTION HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER SOCRATES SAID HE IF A PERSON WERE TO SAY THAT YOU ARE MAKING THESE PEOPLE MISERABLE AND THAT THEY ARE THE CAUSE OF THEIR OWN UNHAPPINESS
3330-170956-0001 THE CITY IN FACT BELONGS TO THEM BUT THEY ARE NONE THE BETTER FOR IT WHEREAS OTHER MEN ACQUIRE LANDS AND BUILD LARGE AND HANDSOME HOUSES AND HAVE EVERYTHING HANDSOME ABOUT THEM OFFERING SACRIFICES TO THE GODS ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT
3330-170956-0002 AND PRACTISING HOSPITALITY MOREOVER AS YOU WERE SAYING JUST NOW THEY HAVE GOLD AND SILVER AND ALL THAT IS USUAL AMONG THE FAVOURITES OF FORTUNE BUT OUR POOR CITIZENS ARE NO BETTER THAN MERCENARIES WHO ARE QUARTERED IN THE CITY
3330-170956-0003 AND ARE ALWAYS MOUNTING GUARD YES I SAID AND YOU MAY ADD THAT THEY ARE ONLY FED AND NOT PAID IN ADDITION TO THEIR FOOD LIKE OTHER MEN AND THEREFORE THEY CANNOT IF THEY WOULD TAKE A JOURNEY OF PLEASURE
3330-170956-0004 THEY HAVE NO MONEY TO SPEND ON A MISTRESS OR ANY OTHER LUXURIOUS FANCY WHICH AS THE WORLD GOES IS THOUGHT TO BE HAPPINESS AND MANY OTHER ACCUSATIONS OF THE SAME NATURE MIGHT BE ADDED BUT
3330-170956-0005 YOU MEAN TO ASK I SAID WHAT WILL BE OUR ANSWER YES IF WE PROCEED ALONG THE OLD PATH MY BELIEF I SAID IS THAT WE SHALL FIND THE ANSWER AND OUR ANSWER WILL BE THAT
3330-170956-0006 EVEN AS THEY ARE OUR GUARDIANS MAY VERY LIKELY BE THE HAPPIEST OF MEN BUT THAT OUR AIM IN FOUNDING THE STATE WAS NOT THE DISPROPORTIONATE HAPPINESS OF ANY ONE CLASS BUT THE GREATEST HAPPINESS OF THE WHOLE
3330-170956-0007 WE THOUGHT THAT IN A STATE WHICH IS ORDERED WITH A VIEW TO THE GOOD OF THE WHOLE WE SHOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO FIND JUSTICE AND IN THE ILL ORDERED STATE INJUSTICE AND HAVING FOUND THEM
3330-170956-0008 WE MIGHT THEN DECIDE WHICH OF THE TWO IS THE HAPPIER AT PRESENT I TAKE IT WE ARE FASHIONING THE HAPPY STATE NOT PIECEMEAL OR WITH A VIEW OF MAKING A FEW HAPPY CITIZENS BUT AS A WHOLE
3330-170956-0009 AND BY AND BY WE WILL PROCEED TO VIEW THE OPPOSITE KIND OF STATE SUPPOSE THAT WE WERE PAINTING A STATUE AND SOME ONE CAME UP TO US AND SAID
3330-170956-0010 WHETHER BY GIVING THIS AND THE OTHER FEATURES THEIR DUE PROPORTION WE MAKE THE WHOLE BEAUTIFUL AND SO I SAY TO YOU DO NOT COMPEL US TO ASSIGN TO THE GUARDIANS A SORT OF HAPPINESS WHICH WILL MAKE THEM ANYTHING BUT GUARDIANS
3330-170956-0011 WHILE THEIR WHEEL IS CONVENIENTLY AT HAND AND WORKING AT POTTERY ONLY AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE IN THIS WAY WE MIGHT MAKE EVERY CLASS HAPPY AND THEN AS YOU IMAGINE THE WHOLE STATE WOULD BE HAPPY
3330-170956-0012 BUT DO NOT PUT THIS IDEA INTO OUR HEADS FOR IF WE LISTEN TO YOU THE HUSBANDMAN WILL BE NO LONGER A HUSBANDMAN THE POTTER WILL CEASE TO BE A POTTER
3330-170956-0013 AND NO ONE WILL HAVE THE CHARACTER OF ANY DISTINCT CLASS IN THE STATE NOW THIS IS NOT OF MUCH CONSEQUENCE WHERE THE CORRUPTION OF SOCIETY
3330-170956-0014 WE MEAN OUR GUARDIANS TO BE TRUE SAVIOURS AND NOT THE DESTROYERS OF THE STATE WHEREAS OUR OPPONENT IS THINKING OF PEASANTS AT A FESTIVAL WHO ARE ENJOYING A LIFE OF REVELRY NOT OF CITIZENS WHO ARE DOING THEIR DUTY TO THE STATE
3330-170956-0015 BUT IF SO WE MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS AND HE IS SPEAKING OF SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT A STATE AND THEREFORE WE MUST CONSIDER WHETHER IN APPOINTING OUR GUARDIANS WE WOULD LOOK TO THEIR GREATEST HAPPINESS INDIVIDUALLY
3330-170956-0016 OR WHETHER THIS PRINCIPLE OF HAPPINESS DOES NOT RATHER RESIDE IN THE STATE AS A WHOLE BUT IF THE LATTER BE THE TRUTH THEN THE GUARDIANS AND AUXILIARIES AND ALL OTHERS EQUALLY WITH THEM
3330-170956-0017 I THINK THAT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT I WONDER WHETHER YOU WILL AGREE WITH ANOTHER REMARK WHICH OCCURS TO ME WHAT MAY THAT BE THERE SEEM TO BE TWO CAUSES OF THE DETERIORATION OF THE ARTS WHAT ARE THEY
3330-170956-0018 WEALTH I SAID AND POVERTY HOW DO THEY ACT THE PROCESS IS AS FOLLOWS WHEN A POTTER BECOMES RICH WILL HE THINK YOU ANY LONGER TAKE THE SAME PAINS WITH HIS ART
3330-170956-0019 CERTAINLY NOT HE WILL GROW MORE AND MORE INDOLENT AND CARELESS VERY TRUE AND THE RESULT WILL BE THAT HE BECOMES A WORSE POTTER YES HE GREATLY DETERIORATES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
3330-170956-0020 IF HE HAS NO MONEY AND CANNOT PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH TOOLS OR INSTRUMENTS HE WILL NOT WORK EQUALLY WELL HIMSELF NOR WILL HE TEACH HIS SONS OR APPRENTICES TO WORK EQUALLY WELL CERTAINLY NOT
3330-170956-0021 WORKMEN AND THEIR WORK ARE EQUALLY LIABLE TO DEGENERATE THAT IS EVIDENT HERE THEN IS A DISCOVERY OF NEW EVILS I SAID AGAINST WHICH THE GUARDIANS WILL HAVE TO WATCH
3330-170956-0022 OR THEY WILL CREEP INTO THE CITY UNOBSERVED WHAT EVILS WEALTH I SAID AND POVERTY THE ONE IS THE PARENT OF LUXURY AND INDOLENCE AND THE OTHER OF MEANNESS AND VICIOUSNESS
3330-170956-0023 AND BOTH OF DISCONTENT THAT IS VERY TRUE HE REPLIED BUT STILL I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW SOCRATES HOW OUR CITY WILL BE ABLE TO GO TO WAR ESPECIALLY AGAINST AN ENEMY WHO IS RICH AND POWERFUL IF DEPRIVED OF THE SINEWS OF WAR
3330-170956-0024 THERE WOULD CERTAINLY BE A DIFFICULTY I REPLIED IN GOING TO WAR WITH ONE SUCH ENEMY BUT THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE ARE TWO OF THEM HOW SO HE ASKED IN THE FIRST PLACE I SAID
3330-170956-0025 IF WE HAVE TO FIGHT OUR SIDE WILL BE TRAINED WARRIORS FIGHTING AGAINST AN ARMY OF RICH MEN THAT IS TRUE HE SAID AND DO YOU NOT SUPPOSE ADEIMANTUS THAT A SINGLE BOXER
3330-170956-0026 WHO WAS PERFECT IN HIS ART WOULD EASILY BE A MATCH FOR TWO STOUT AND WELL TO DO GENTLEMEN WHO WERE NOT BOXERS HARDLY IF THEY CAME UPON HIM AT ONCE WHAT NOW I SAID IF HE WERE ABLE TO RUN AWAY
3330-170956-0028 CERTAINLY HE SAID THERE WOULD BE NOTHING WONDERFUL IN THAT AND YET RICH MEN PROBABLY HAVE A GREATER SUPERIORITY IN THE SCIENCE AND PRACTISE OF BOXING THAN THEY HAVE IN MILITARY QUALITIES
3330-170956-0029 LIKELY ENOUGH THEN WE MAY ASSUME THAT OUR ATHLETES WILL BE ABLE TO FIGHT WITH TWO OR THREE TIMES THEIR OWN NUMBER I AGREE WITH YOU FOR I THINK YOU RIGHT
3330-170956-0030 WHAT IS THE TRUTH SILVER AND GOLD WE NEITHER HAVE NOR ARE PERMITTED TO HAVE BUT YOU MAY DO YOU THEREFORE COME AND HELP US IN WAR AND TAKE THE SPOILS OF THE OTHER CITY
3330-170956-0031 WHO ON HEARING THESE WORDS WOULD CHOOSE TO FIGHT AGAINST LEAN WIRY DOGS RATHER THAN WITH THE DOGS ON THEIR SIDE AGAINST FAT AND TENDER SHEEP THAT IS NOT LIKELY
3330-170956-0032 AND YET THERE MIGHT BE A DANGER TO THE POOR STATE IF THE WEALTH OF MANY STATES WERE TO BE GATHERED INTO ONE BUT HOW SIMPLE OF YOU TO USE THE TERM STATE AT ALL OF ANY BUT OUR OWN WHY SO
3330-170956-0033 YOU OUGHT TO SPEAK OF OTHER STATES IN THE PLURAL NUMBER NOT ONE OF THEM IS A CITY BUT MANY CITIES AS THEY SAY IN THE GAME FOR INDEED ANY CITY HOWEVER SMALL IS IN FACT DIVIDED INTO TWO
3330-170956-0034 ONE THE CITY OF THE POOR THE OTHER OF THE RICH THESE ARE AT WAR WITH ONE ANOTHER AND IN EITHER THERE ARE MANY SMALLER DIVISIONS AND YOU WOULD BE ALTOGETHER BESIDE THE MARK IF YOU TREATED THEM ALL AS A SINGLE STATE
3330-170956-0035 BUT IF YOU DEAL WITH THEM AS MANY AND GIVE THE WEALTH OR POWER OR PERSONS OF THE ONE TO THE OTHERS YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE A GREAT MANY FRIENDS AND NOT MANY ENEMIES AND YOUR STATE
3330-170956-0036 WHILE THE WISE ORDER WHICH HAS NOW BEEN PRESCRIBED CONTINUES TO PREVAIL IN HER WILL BE THE GREATEST OF STATES I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY IN REPUTATION OR APPEARANCE BUT IN DEED AND TRUTH
3330-170956-0037 THOUGH SHE NUMBER NOT MORE THAN A THOUSAND DEFENDERS A SINGLE STATE WHICH IS HER EQUAL YOU WILL HARDLY FIND EITHER AMONG HELLENES OR BARBARIANS THOUGH MANY THAT APPEAR TO BE AS GREAT AND MANY TIMES GREATER
3330-170956-0038 THAT IS MOST TRUE HE SAID AND WHAT I SAID WILL BE THE BEST LIMIT FOR OUR RULERS TO FIX WHEN THEY ARE CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE STATE AND THE AMOUNT OF TERRITORY WHICH THEY ARE TO INCLUDE AND BEYOND WHICH THEY WILL NOT GO
3330-170956-0039 WHAT LIMIT WOULD YOU PROPOSE I WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO INCREASE SO FAR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH UNITY THAT I THINK IS THE PROPER LIMIT VERY GOOD HE SAID
3330-170956-0040 HERE THEN I SAID IS ANOTHER ORDER WHICH WILL HAVE TO BE CONVEYED TO OUR GUARDIANS LET OUR CITY BE ACCOUNTED NEITHER LARGE NOR SMALL BUT ONE AND SELF SUFFICING
3330-170956-0041 THE OFFSPRING OF THE LOWER CLASSES WHEN NATURALLY SUPERIOR THE INTENTION WAS THAT IN THE CASE OF THE CITIZENS GENERALLY EACH INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE PUT TO THE USE FOR WHICH NATURE INTENDED HIM ONE TO ONE WORK
3330-170956-0042 AND THEN EVERY MAN WOULD DO HIS OWN BUSINESS AND BE ONE AND NOT MANY AND SO THE WHOLE CITY WOULD BE ONE AND NOT MANY YES HE SAID THAT IS NOT SO DIFFICULT
3330-170956-0043 THE REGULATIONS WHICH WE ARE PRESCRIBING MY GOOD ADEIMANTUS ARE NOT AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED A NUMBER OF GREAT PRINCIPLES BUT TRIFLES ALL IF CARE BE TAKEN AS THE SAYING IS OF THE ONE GREAT THING
3330-170956-0044 A THING HOWEVER WHICH I WOULD RATHER CALL NOT GREAT BUT SUFFICIENT FOR OUR PURPOSE WHAT MAY THAT BE HE ASKED EDUCATION I SAID AND NURTURE
3330-170956-0045 IF OUR CITIZENS ARE WELL EDUCATED AND GROW INTO SENSIBLE MEN THEY WILL EASILY SEE THEIR WAY THROUGH ALL THESE AS WELL AS OTHER MATTERS WHICH I OMIT SUCH FOR EXAMPLE AS MARRIAGE THE POSSESSION OF WOMEN AND THE PROCREATION OF CHILDREN
3330-170956-0046 THAT WILL BE THE BEST WAY OF SETTLING THEM ALSO I SAID THE STATE IF ONCE STARTED WELL MOVES WITH ACCUMULATING FORCE LIKE A WHEEL
3330-170956-0047 FOR GOOD NURTURE AND EDUCATION IMPLANT GOOD CONSTITUTIONS AND THESE GOOD CONSTITUTIONS TAKING ROOT IN A GOOD EDUCATION IMPROVE MORE AND MORE AND THIS IMPROVEMENT AFFECTS THE BREED IN MAN AS IN OTHER ANIMALS
3330-170956-0048 VERY POSSIBLY HE SAID THEN TO SUM UP THIS IS THE POINT TO WHICH ABOVE ALL THE ATTENTION OF OUR RULERS SHOULD BE DIRECTED THAT MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC BE PRESERVED IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM AND NO INNOVATION MADE
3330-170956-0049 THEY MUST DO THEIR UTMOST TO MAINTAIN THEM INTACT AND WHEN ANY ONE SAYS THAT MANKIND MOST REGARD THE NEWEST SONG WHICH THE SINGERS HAVE THEY WILL BE AFRAID THAT HE MAY BE PRAISING NOT NEW SONGS BUT A NEW KIND OF SONG
3330-170956-0050 HE SAYS THAT WHEN MODES OF MUSIC CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE STATE ALWAYS CHANGE WITH THEM YES SAID ADEIMANTUS AND YOU MAY ADD MY SUFFRAGE TO DAMON'S AND YOUR OWN THEN I SAID
3330-170956-0051 OUR GUARDIANS MUST LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF THEIR FORTRESS IN MUSIC YES HE SAID THE LAWLESSNESS OF WHICH YOU SPEAK TOO EASILY STEALS IN YES I REPLIED
3330-170956-0052 IN THE FORM OF AMUSEMENT AND AT FIRST SIGHT IT APPEARS HARMLESS WHY YES HE SAID AND THERE IS NO HARM WERE IT NOT THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE THIS SPIRIT OF LICENCE FINDING A HOME IMPERCEPTIBLY PENETRATES INTO MANNERS AND CUSTOMS
3330-170956-0053 WHENCE ISSUING WITH GREATER FORCE IT INVADES CONTRACTS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN AND FROM CONTRACTS GOES ON TO LAWS AND CONSTITUTIONS
3330-170956-0054 IN UTTER RECKLESSNESS ENDING AT LAST SOCRATES BY AN OVERTHROW OF ALL RIGHTS PRIVATE AS WELL AS PUBLIC IS THAT TRUE I SAID THAT IS MY BELIEF HE REPLIED THEN AS I WAS SAYING
3330-170956-0055 OUR YOUTH SHOULD BE TRAINED FROM THE FIRST IN A STRICTER SYSTEM FOR IF AMUSEMENTS BECOME LAWLESS AND THE YOUTHS THEMSELVES BECOME LAWLESS THEY CAN NEVER GROW UP INTO WELL CONDUCTED AND VIRTUOUS CITIZENS VERY TRUE HE SAID
3330-170956-0056 AND WHEN THEY HAVE MADE A GOOD BEGINNING IN PLAY AND BY THE HELP OF MUSIC HAVE GAINED THE HABIT OF GOOD ORDER THEN THIS HABIT OF ORDER IN A MANNER
3330-170956-0057 HOW UNLIKE THE LAWLESS PLAY OF THE OTHERS WILL ACCOMPANY THEM IN ALL THEIR ACTIONS AND BE A PRINCIPLE OF GROWTH TO THEM AND IF THERE BE ANY FALLEN PLACES IN THE STATE WILL RAISE THEM UP AGAIN VERY TRUE HE SAID
3330-170956-0058 THUS EDUCATED THEY WILL INVENT FOR THEMSELVES ANY LESSER RULES WHICH THEIR PREDECESSORS HAVE ALTOGETHER NEGLECTED WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN SUCH THINGS AS THESE WHEN THE YOUNG ARE TO BE SILENT BEFORE THEIR ELDERS
3330-170956-0059 HOW THEY ARE TO SHOW RESPECT TO THEM BY STANDING AND MAKING THEM SIT WHAT HONOUR IS DUE TO PARENTS WHAT GARMENTS OR SHOES ARE TO BE WORN THE MODE OF DRESSING THE HAIR DEPORTMENT AND MANNERS IN GENERAL YOU WOULD AGREE WITH ME YES
3330-170956-0060 BUT THERE IS I THINK SMALL WISDOM IN LEGISLATING ABOUT SUCH MATTERS I DOUBT IF IT IS EVER DONE NOR ARE ANY PRECISE WRITTEN ENACTMENTS ABOUT THEM LIKELY TO BE LASTING IMPOSSIBLE IT WOULD SEEM ADEIMANTUS
3330-170956-0061 WILL DETERMINE HIS FUTURE LIFE DOES NOT LIKE ALWAYS ATTRACT LIKE TO BE SURE UNTIL SOME ONE RARE AND GRAND RESULT IS REACHED WHICH MAY BE GOOD AND MAY BE THE REVERSE OF GOOD THAT IS NOT TO BE DENIED
3330-170956-0062 AND FOR THIS REASON I SAID I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO LEGISLATE FURTHER ABOUT THEM
3330-172156-0000 WHO HURRIED HIM TO THE BAPTISMAL FOUNT AND SO SAVED HIM FROM SHARING THE LOT OF HIS FATHER THOUGH HE RETAINED MANY MARKS OF HIS UNEARTHLY ORIGIN AT THIS TIME VORTIGERN REIGNED IN BRITAIN
3330-172156-0001 HE WAS A USURPER WHO HAD CAUSED THE DEATH OF HIS SOVEREIGN MOINES AND DRIVEN THE TWO BROTHERS OF THE LATE KING WHOSE NAMES WERE UTHER AND PENDRAGON INTO BANISHMENT VORTIGERN
3330-172156-0002 WHO LIVED IN CONSTANT FEAR OF THE RETURN OF THE RIGHTFUL HEIRS OF THE KINGDOM BEGAN TO ERECT A STRONG TOWER FOR DEFENCE THE EDIFICE WHEN BROUGHT BY THE WORKMEN TO A CERTAIN HEIGHT THREE TIMES FELL TO THE GROUND WITHOUT ANY APPARENT CAUSE
3330-172156-0003 THE KING CONSULTED HIS ASTROLOGERS ON THIS WONDERFUL EVENT AND LEARNED FROM THEM THAT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO BATHE THE CORNER STONE OF THE FOUNDATION WITH THE BLOOD OF A CHILD BORN WITHOUT A MORTAL FATHER
3330-172156-0004 IN SEARCH OF SUCH AN INFANT VORTIGERN SENT HIS MESSENGERS ALL OVER THE KINGDOM AND THEY BY ACCIDENT DISCOVERED MERLIN WHOSE LINEAGE SEEMED TO POINT HIM OUT AS THE INDIVIDUAL WANTED THEY TOOK HIM TO THE KING BUT MERLIN
3330-172156-0005 YOUNG AS HE WAS EXPLAINED TO THE KING THE ABSURDITY OF ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE THE FABRIC BY SUCH MEANS FOR HE TOLD HIM THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE INSTABILITY OF THE TOWER WAS ITS BEING PLACED OVER THE DEN OF TWO IMMENSE DRAGONS
3330-172156-0006 WHOSE COMBATS SHOOK THE EARTH ABOVE THEM THE KING ORDERED HIS WORKMEN TO DIG BENEATH THE TOWER AND WHEN THEY HAD DONE SO THEY DISCOVERED TWO ENORMOUS SERPENTS THE ONE WHITE AS MILK THE OTHER RED AS FIRE
3330-172156-0007 THE MULTITUDE LOOKED ON WITH AMAZEMENT TILL THE SERPENTS SLOWLY RISING FROM THEIR DEN AND EXPANDING THEIR ENORMOUS FOLDS BEGAN THE COMBAT WHEN EVERY ONE FLED IN TERROR EXCEPT MERLIN
3330-172156-0008 WHO STOOD BY CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND CHEERING ON THE CONFLICT THE RED DRAGON WAS SLAIN AND THE WHITE ONE GLIDING THROUGH A CLEFT IN THE ROCK DISAPPEARED THESE ANIMALS TYPIFIED AS MERLIN AFTERWARDS EXPLAINED
3330-172156-0009 THE INVASION OF UTHER AND PENDRAGON THE RIGHTFUL PRINCES WHO SOON AFTER LANDED WITH A GREAT ARMY VORTIGERN WAS DEFEATED AND AFTERWARDS BURNED ALIVE IN THE CASTLE HE HAD TAKEN SUCH PAINS TO CONSTRUCT
3330-172156-0010 ON THE DEATH OF VORTIGERN PENDRAGON ASCENDED THE THRONE MERLIN BECAME HIS CHIEF ADVISER AND OFTEN ASSISTED THE KING BY HIS MAGICAL ARTS MERLIN WHO KNEW THE RANGE OF ALL THEIR ARTS
3330-172156-0011 HAD BUILT THE KING HIS HAVENS SHIPS AND HALLS VIVIAN AMONG OTHER ENDOWMENTS HE HAD THE POWER OF TRANSFORMING HIMSELF INTO ANY SHAPE HE PLEASED AT ONE TIME HE APPEARED AS A DWARF
3330-172156-0012 AT OTHERS AS A DAMSEL A PAGE OR EVEN A GREYHOUND OR A STAG THIS FACULTY HE OFTEN EMPLOYED FOR THE SERVICE OF THE KING AND SOMETIMES ALSO FOR THE DIVERSION OF THE COURT AND THE SOVEREIGN
3330-172156-0013 MERLIN CONTINUED TO BE A FAVORITE COUNSELLOR THROUGH THE REIGNS OF PENDRAGON UTHER AND ARTHUR AND AT LAST DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW AND WAS NO MORE FOUND AMONG MEN
3330-172156-0014 THROUGH THE TREACHERY OF HIS MISTRESS VIVIANE THE FAIRY WHICH HAPPENED IN THIS WISE MERLIN HAVING BECOME ENAMOURED OF THE FAIR VIVIANE THE LADY OF THE LAKE WAS WEAK ENOUGH TO IMPART TO HER VARIOUS IMPORTANT SECRETS OF HIS ART
3330-172156-0015 BEING IMPELLED BY FATAL DESTINY OF WHICH HE WAS AT THE SAME TIME FULLY AWARE THE LADY HOWEVER WAS NOT CONTENT WITH HIS DEVOTION UNBOUNDED AS IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN
3330-172156-0016 BUT CAST ABOUT THE ROMANCE TELLS US HOW SHE MIGHT DETAIN HIM FOR EVERMORE AND ONE DAY ADDRESSED HIM IN THESE TERMS SIR I WOULD THAT WE SHOULD MAKE A FAIR PLACE AND A SUITABLE
3330-172156-0017 SO CONTRIVED BY ART AND BY CUNNING THAT IT MIGHT NEVER BE UNDONE AND THAT YOU AND I SHOULD BE THERE IN JOY AND SOLACE MY LADY SAID MERLIN I WILL DO ALL THIS
3330-172156-0018 AND I WILL DO IT AND THEN IT WILL BE MORE TO MY MIND I GRANT YOU THIS SAID MERLIN THEN HE BEGAN TO DEVISE AND THE DAMSEL PUT IT ALL IN WRITING AND WHEN HE HAD DEVISED THE WHOLE
3330-172156-0019 THEN HAD THE DAMSEL FULL GREAT JOY AND SHOWED HIM GREATER SEMBLANCE OF LOVE THAN SHE HAD EVER BEFORE MADE AND THEY SOJOURNED TOGETHER A LONG WHILE
3330-172156-0020 AT LENGTH IT FELL OUT THAT AS THEY WERE GOING ONE DAY HAND IN HAND THROUGH THE FOREST OF BRECELIANDE THEY FOUND A BUSH OF WHITE THORN WHICH WAS LADEN WITH FLOWERS AND THEY SEATED THEMSELVES UNDER THE SHADE OF THIS WHITE THORN
3330-172156-0021 UPON THE GREEN GRASS AND MERLIN LAID HIS HEAD UPON THE DAMSEL'S LAP AND FELL ASLEEP THEN THE DAMSEL ROSE AND MADE A RING WITH HER WIMPLE ROUND THE BUSH AND ROUND MERLIN AND BEGAN HER ENCHANTMENTS SUCH AS HE HIMSELF HAD TAUGHT HER
3330-172156-0022 AND NINE TIMES SHE MADE THE RING AND NINE TIMES SHE MADE THE ENCHANTMENT AND THEN SHE WENT AND SAT DOWN BY HIM AND PLACED HIS HEAD AGAIN UPON HER LAP AND A SLEEP FELL UPON MERLIN MORE LIKE DEATH
3330-172156-0023 THEN VIVIAN ROSE AND FROM HER BROWN LOCKED HEAD THE WIMPLE THROWS AND TAKES IT IN HER HAND AND WAVES IT OVER THE BLOSSOMED THORN TREE AND HER SLEEPING LOVER
3330-172156-0024 NINE TIMES SHE WAVED THE FLUTTERING WIMPLE ROUND AND MADE A LITTLE PLOT OF MAGIC GROUND
3330-172156-0025 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS ENCLOSED IN THE STRONGEST TOWER IN THE WORLD AND LAID UPON A FAIR BED
3330-172156-0026 MY LADY YOU HAVE DECEIVED ME UNLESS YOU ABIDE WITH ME FOR NO ONE HATH POWER TO UNMAKE THIS TOWER BUT YOU ALONE
3330-172156-0027 AND IN THIS SHE HELD HER COVENANT WITH HIM AND MERLIN NEVER WENT OUT OF THAT TOWER WHERE HIS MISTRESS VIVIANE HAD ENCLOSED HIM BUT SHE ENTERED AND WENT OUT AGAIN WHEN SHE LISTED
3330-172156-0028 AFTER THIS EVENT MERLIN WAS NEVER MORE KNOWN TO HOLD CONVERSE WITH ANY MORTAL BUT VIVIANE EXCEPT ON ONE OCCASION ARTHUR HAVING FOR SOME TIME MISSED HIM FROM HIS COURT
3330-172156-0029 WHO MET WITH A VERY UNPLEASANT ADVENTURE WHILE ENGAGED IN THIS QUEST
3330-172156-0030 WHEN SUDDENLY HE HEARD THE VOICE OF ONE GROANING ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND LOOKING THAT WAY HE COULD SEE NOTHING SAVE A KIND OF SMOKE WHICH SEEMED LIKE AIR AND THROUGH WHICH HE COULD NOT PASS
3330-172156-0031 BY WHAT MISADVENTURE HE WAS IMPRISONED THERE AH SIR HE ADDED YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME MORE AND THAT GRIEVES ME BUT I CANNOT REMEDY IT I SHALL NEVER MORE SPEAK TO YOU NOR TO ANY OTHER PERSON SAVE ONLY MY MISTRESS
3330-172156-0032 BUT DO THOU HASTEN TO KING ARTHUR AND CHARGE HIM FROM ME TO UNDERTAKE WITHOUT DELAY THE QUEST OF THE SACRED GRAAL THE KNIGHT IS ALREADY BORN AND HAS RECEIVED KNIGHTHOOD AT HIS HANDS
3330-172156-0033 ASSURING HIM THAT HE SHOULD SPEEDILY BE DISENCHANTED AND HE PREDICTED TO HIM
3330-172156-0034 BUT IT IS CHIEFLY ON GREAT OCCASIONS AND AT A PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO HIS DEATH OR MAGICAL DISAPPEARANCE IN THE ROMANTIC POEMS OF ITALY AND IN SPENSER MERLIN IS CHIEFLY REPRESENTED AS A MAGICAL ARTIST
3330-172156-0035 SPENSER REPRESENTS HIM AS THE ARTIFICER OF THE IMPENETRABLE SHIELD AND OTHER ARMOR OF PRINCE ARTHUR
3330-172156-0036 AND OF A MIRROR IN WHICH A DAMSEL VIEWED HER LOVER'S SHADE THE FOUNTAIN OF LOVE IN THE ORLANDO INNAMORATA IS DESCRIBED AS HIS WORK AND IN THE POEM OF ARIOSTO
3330-172156-0037 WE ARE TOLD OF A HALL ADORNED WITH PROPHETIC PAINTINGS WHICH DEMONS HAD EXECUTED IN A SINGLE NIGHT UNDER THE DIRECTION OF MERLIN THE FOLLOWING LEGEND IS FROM SPENSER'S FAERY QUEENE BOOK THREE
3330-172156-0038 OR CAERMARTHEN IN WALES MERLIN'S TOWER AND THE IMPRISONED FIENDS FORTHWITH THEMSELVES
3330-172156-0039 THAT NONE MIGHT THEM BEWRAY
3330-172156-0040 THEY TOOK THEIR WAY THERE THE WISE MERLIN WHYLOME WONT THEY SAY
3330-172156-0041 LOW UNDERNEATH THE GROUND
3330-172156-0042 THAT OF NO LIVING WIGHT HE MOTE BE FOUND WHENSO HE COUNSELLED WITH HIS SPRIGHTS ENCOMPASSED ROUND AND IF THOU EVER HAPPEN THAT SAME WAY TO TRAVEL GO TO SEE THAT DREADFUL PLACE IT IS A HIDEOUS HOLLOW CAVE THEY SAY
3330-172156-0043 BUT DARE NOT THOU I CHARGE IN ANY CASE TO ENTER INTO THAT SAME BALEFUL BOWER FOR FEAR THE CRUEL FIENDS SHOULD THEE UNWARES DEVOUR BUT STANDING HIGH ALOFT LOW LAY THINE EAR
3330-172156-0044 AND THERE SUCH GHASTLY NOISE OF IRON CHAINS AND BRAZEN CAULDRONS THOU SHALT RUMBLING HEAR WHICH THOUSAND SPRITES WITH LONG ENDURING PAINS DO TOSS THAT IT WILL STUN THY FEEBLE BRAINS
3330-172156-0045 AND OFTENTIMES LOUD STROKES AND RINGING SOUNDS FROM UNDER THAT DEEP ROCK MOST HORRIBLY REBOUNDS THE CAUSE SOME SAY IS THIS A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE THAT MERLIN DIED
3330-172156-0046 HE DID INTEND A BRAZEN WALL IN COMPAS TO COMPILE ABOUT CAERMERDIN AND DID IT COMMEND UNTO THESE SPRITES TO BRING TO PERFECT END DURING WHICH WORK THE LADY OF THE LAKE
3330-172156-0047 WHOM LONG HE LOVED FOR HIM IN HASTE DID SEND WHO THEREBY FORCED HIS WORKMEN TO FORSAKE THEM BOUND TILL HIS RETURN THEIR LABOR NOT TO SLACK
3330-172156-0048 IN THE MEAN TIME THROUGH THAT FALSE LADY'S TRAIN HE WAS SURPRISED AND BURIED UNDER BEARE HE EVER TO HIS WORK RETURNED AGAIN NATHLESS THOSE FIENDS MAY NOT THEIR WORK FORBEAR SO GREATLY HIS COMMANDEMENT THEY FEAR
3330-172156-0049 BUT THERE DO TOIL AND TRAVAIL DAY AND NIGHT UNTIL THAT BRAZEN WALL THEY UP DO REAR FOR MERLIN HAD IN MAGIC MORE INSIGHT THAN EVER HIM BEFORE OR AFTER LIVING WIGHT FOOTNOTE BURIED UNDER BEARE
3340-169293-0000 THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION AT WHICH I HAD BEEN ASKED TO MAKE AN ADDRESS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NEGRO RACE AS STATED IN THE LAST CHAPTER WAS OPENED WITH A SHORT ADDRESS FROM GOVERNOR BULLOCK AFTER OTHER INTERESTING EXERCISES INCLUDING AN INVOCATION FROM BISHOP NELSON OF GEORGIA
3340-169293-0001 AS I REMEMBER IT NOW THE THING THAT WAS UPPERMOST IN MY MIND WAS THE DESIRE TO SAY SOMETHING THAT WOULD CEMENT THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE RACES AND BRING ABOUT HEARTY COOPERATION BETWEEN THEM
3340-169293-0002 I BUT CONVEY TO YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND DIRECTORS THE SENTIMENT OF THE MASSES OF MY RACE WHEN I SAY THAT IN NO WAY HAVE THE VALUE AND MANHOOD OF THE AMERICAN NEGRO BEEN MORE FITTINGLY AND GENEROUSLY RECOGNIZED
3340-169293-0003 THAN BY THE MANAGERS OF THIS MAGNIFICENT EXPOSITION AT EVERY STAGE OF ITS PROGRESS IT IS A RECOGNITION THAT WILL DO MORE TO CEMENT THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE TWO RACES THAN ANY OCCURRENCE SINCE THE DAWN OF OUR FREEDOM
3340-169293-0004 NOT ONLY THIS BUT THE OPPORTUNITY HERE AFFORDED WILL AWAKEN AMONG US A NEW ERA OF INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS IGNORANT AND INEXPERIENCED IT IS NOT STRANGE THAT IN THE FIRST YEARS OF OUR NEW LIFE WE BEGAN AT THE TOP INSTEAD OF AT THE BOTTOM
3340-169293-0005 THAT A SEAT IN CONGRESS OR THE STATE LEGISLATURE WAS MORE SOUGHT THAN REAL ESTATE OR INDUSTRIAL SKILL THAT THE POLITICAL CONVENTION OR STUMP SPEAKING HAD MORE ATTRACTIONS THAN STARTING A DAIRY FARM OR TRUCK GARDEN
3340-169293-0006 CAST DOWN YOUR BUCKET WHERE YOU ARE A SECOND TIME THE SIGNAL WATER WATER SEND US WATER RAN UP FROM THE DISTRESSED VESSEL AND WAS ANSWERED CAST DOWN YOUR BUCKET WHERE YOU ARE AND A THIRD AND FOURTH SIGNAL FOR WATER WAS ANSWERED CAST DOWN YOUR BUCKET WHERE YOU ARE
3340-169293-0007 THE CAPTAIN OF THE DISTRESSED VESSEL AT LAST HEADING THE INJUNCTION CAST DOWN HIS BUCKET AND IT CAME UP FULL OF FRESH SPARKLING WATER FROM THE MOUTH OF THE AMAZON RIVER
3340-169293-0008 TO THOSE OF MY RACE WHO DEPEND ON BETTERING THEIR CONDITION IN A FOREIGN LAND OR WHO UNDERESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTIVATING FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE SOUTHERN WHITE MAN WHO IS THEIR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR I WOULD SAY
3340-169293-0009 NO RACE CAN PROSPER TILL IT LEARNS THAT THERE IS AS MUCH DIGNITY IN TILLING A FIELD AS IN WRITING A POEM IT IS AT THE BOTTOM OF LIFE WE MUST BEGIN
3340-169293-0010 BUILDED YOUR RAILROADS AND CITIES AND BROUGHT FORTH TREASURES FROM THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH AND HELPED MAKE POSSIBLE THIS MAGNIFICENT REPRESENTATION OF THE PROGRESS OF THE SOUTH CASTING DOWN YOUR BUCKET AMONG MY PEOPLE HELPING AND ENCOURAGING THEM AS YOU ARE DOING ON THESE GROUNDS
3340-169293-0011 AND TO EDUCATION OF HEAD HAND AND HEART YOU WILL FIND THAT THEY WILL BUY YOUR SURPLUS LAND MAKE BLOSSOM THE WASTE PLACES IN YOUR FIELDS AND RUN YOUR FACTORIES
3340-169293-0012 WHILE DOING THIS YOU CAN BE SURE IN THE FUTURE AS IN THE PAST THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES WILL BE SURROUNDED BY THE MOST PATIENT FAITHFUL LAW ABIDING AND UNRESENTFUL PEOPLE THAT THE WORLD HAS SEEN
3340-169293-0013 AS WE HAVE PROVED OUR LOYALTY TO YOU IN THE PAST NURSING YOUR CHILDREN WATCHING BY THE SICK BED OF YOUR MOTHERS AND FATHERS
3340-169293-0014 THERE IS NO DEFENCE OR SECURITY FOR ANY OF US EXCEPT IN THE HIGHEST INTELLIGENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF ALL IF ANYWHERE THERE ARE EFFORTS TENDING TO CURTAIL THE FULLEST GROWTH OF THE NEGRO LET THESE EFFORTS BE TURNED INTO STIMULATING ENCOURAGING AND MAKING HIM THE MOST USEFUL AND INTELLIGENT CITIZEN
3340-169293-0015 THE LAWS OF CHANGELESS JUSTICE BIND OPPRESSOR WITH OPPRESSED AND CLOSE AS SIN AND SUFFERING JOINED WE MARCH TO FATE ABREAST NEARLY SIXTEEN MILLIONS OF HANDS WILL AID YOU IN PULLING THE LOAD UPWARD OR THEY WILL PULL AGAINST YOU THE LOAD DOWNWARD
3340-169293-0016 WE SHALL CONSTITUTE ONE THIRD AND MORE OF THE IGNORANCE AND CRIME OF THE SOUTH OR ONE THIRD ITS INTELLIGENCE AND PROGRESS WE SHALL CONTRIBUTE ONE THIRD TO THE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRIAL PROSPERITY OF THE SOUTH OR WE SHALL PROVE A VERITABLE BODY OF DEATH STAGNATING DEPRESSING RETARDING EVERY EFFORT TO ADVANCE THE BODY POLITIC
3340-169293-0017 STARTING THIRTY YEARS AGO WITH OWNERSHIP HERE AND THERE IN A FEW QUILTS AND PUMPKINS AND CHICKENS GATHERED FROM MISCELLANEOUS SOURCES REMEMBER THE PATH THAT HAS LED FROM THESE TO THE INVENTIONS AND PRODUCTION OF AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS BUGGIES STEAM ENGINES NEWSPAPERS BOOKS
3340-169293-0018 STATUARY CARVING PAINTINGS THE MANAGEMENT OF DRUG STORES AND BANKS HAS NOT BEEN TRODDEN WITHOUT CONTACT WITH THORNS AND THISTLES WHILE WE TAKE PRIDE IN WHAT WE EXHIBIT AS A RESULT OF OUR INDEPENDENT EFFORTS WE DO NOT FOR A MOMENT FORGET THAT OUR PART IN THIS EXHIBITION WOULD FALL FAR SHORT OF YOUR EXPECTATIONS
3340-169293-0019 BUT IT IS VASTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE BE PREPARED FOR THE EXERCISES OF THESE PRIVILEGES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A DOLLAR IN A FACTORY JUST NOW IS WORTH INFINITELY MORE THAN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND A DOLLAR IN AN OPERA HOUSE
3340-169293-0020 IN CONCLUSION MAY I REPEAT THAT NOTHING IN THIRTY YEARS HAS GIVEN US MORE HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT
3340-169293-0021 AND DRAWN US SO NEAR TO YOU OF THE WHITE RACE AS THIS OPPORTUNITY OFFERED BY THE EXPOSITION AND HERE BENDING AS IT WERE OVER THE ALTAR THAT REPRESENTS THE RESULTS OF THE STRUGGLES OF YOUR RACE AND MINE BOTH STARTING PRACTICALLY EMPTY HANDED THREE DECADES AGO I PLEDGE THAT IN YOUR EFFORT TO WORK OUT THE GREAT AND INTRICATE PROBLEM WHICH GOD HAS LAID AT THE DOORS OF THE SOUTH
3340-169293-0022 YOU SHALL HAVE AT ALL TIMES THE PATIENT SYMPATHETIC HELP OF MY RACE
3340-169293-0023 I RECEIVED SO MANY AND SUCH HEARTY CONGRATULATIONS THAT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OF THE BUILDING I DID NOT APPRECIATE TO ANY DEGREE HOWEVER THE IMPRESSION WHICH MY ADDRESS SEEMED TO HAVE MADE UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN I WENT INTO THE BUSINESS PART OF THE CITY
3340-169293-0024 AS SOON AS I WAS RECOGNIZED I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND MYSELF POINTED OUT AND SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF MEN WHO WISHED TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ME
3340-169293-0025 TELEGRAPHED TO A NEW YORK PAPER AMONG OTHER WORDS THE FOLLOWING I DO NOT EXAGGERATE WHEN I SAY THAT PROFESSOR BOOKER T WASHINGTON'S ADDRESS YESTERDAY WAS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE SPEECHES BOTH AS TO CHARACTER AND AS TO THE WARMTH OF ITS RECEPTION EVER DELIVERED TO A SOUTHERN AUDIENCE
3340-169293-0026 THE ADDRESS WAS A REVELATION THE WHOLE SPEECH IS A PLATFORM UPON WHICH BLACKS AND WHITES CAN STAND WITH FULL JUSTICE TO EACH OTHER THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT SAID EDITORIALLY
3340-169293-0027 ONE LECTURE BUREAU OFFERED ME FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A NIGHT AND EXPENSES IF I WOULD PLACE MY SERVICES AT ITS DISPOSAL FOR A GIVEN PERIOD
3340-169293-0028 SOME DAYS AFTER ITS DELIVERY I SENT A COPY OF MY ADDRESS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE HON GROVER CLEVELAND I RECEIVED FROM HIM THE FOLLOWING AUTOGRAPH REPLY
3340-169293-0029 YOURS VERY TRULY GROVER CLEVELAND LATER I MET MISTER CLEVELAND FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN AS PRESIDENT HE VISITED THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION
3340-169293-0030 AT THE REQUEST OF MYSELF AND OTHERS HE CONSENTED TO SPEND AN HOUR IN THE NEGRO BUILDING FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSPECTING THE NEGRO EXHIBIT AND OF GIVING THE COLOURED PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM AS SOON AS I MET MISTER CLEVELAND I BECAME IMPRESSED WITH HIS SIMPLICITY GREATNESS AND RUGGED HONESTY
3340-169293-0031 BUT HAS ALWAYS CONSENTED TO DO ANYTHING I HAVE ASKED OF HIM FOR OUR SCHOOL THIS HE HAS DONE WHETHER IT WAS TO MAKE A PERSONAL DONATION OR TO USE HIS INFLUENCE IN SECURING THE DONATIONS OF OTHERS JUDGING FROM MY PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER CLEVELAND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT HE IS CONSCIOUS OF POSSESSING ANY COLOUR PREJUDICE
3340-169293-0032 HE IS TOO GREAT FOR THAT IN MY CONTACT WITH PEOPLE I FIND THAT AS A RULE IT IS ONLY THE LITTLE NARROW PEOPLE WHO LIVE FOR THEMSELVES WHO NEVER READ GOOD BOOKS WHO DO NOT TRAVEL
3340-169293-0033 I HAVE ALSO FOUND THAT FEW THINGS IF ANY ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING ONE SO BLIND AND NARROW AS RACE PREJUDICE I OFTEN SAY TO OUR STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF MY TALKS TO THEM ON SUNDAY EVENINGS IN THE CHAPEL THAT THE LONGER I LIVE AND THE MORE EXPERIENCE I HAVE OF THE WORLD
3340-169293-0034 THE MORE I AM CONVINCED THAT AFTER ALL THE ONE THING THAT IS MOST WORTH LIVING FOR AND DYING FOR IF NEED BE IS THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING SOME ONE ELSE MORE HAPPY AND MORE USEFUL
3340-169293-0035 BUT AFTER THE FIRST BURST OF ENTHUSIASM BEGAN TO DIE AWAY AND THE COLOURED PEOPLE BEGAN READING THE SPEECH IN COLD TYPE SOME OF THEM SEEMED TO FEEL THAT THEY HAD BEEN HYPNOTIZED THEY SEEMED TO FEEL THAT I HAD BEEN TOO LIBERAL IN MY REMARKS TOWARD THE SOUTHERN WHITES
3340-169293-0036 BUT LATER THESE REACTIONARY ONES SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN WON OVER TO MY WAY OF BELIEVING AND ACTING WHILE SPEAKING OF CHANGES IN PUBLIC SENTIMENT I RECALL THAT ABOUT TEN YEARS AFTER THE SCHOOL AT TUSKEGEE WAS ESTABLISHED I HAD AN EXPERIENCE THAT I SHALL NEVER FORGET
3340-169293-0037 I WROTE THE LETTER GIVING THE EXACT FACTS AS I CONCEIVED THEM TO BE THE PICTURE PAINTED WAS A RATHER BLACK ONE OR SINCE I AM BLACK SHALL I SAY WHITE IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE WITH A RACE BUT A FEW YEARS OUT OF SLAVERY A RACE WHICH HAD NOT HAD TIME OR OPPORTUNITY TO PRODUCE A COMPETENT MINISTRY
3340-169293-0038 THIS MISSIONARY HAD A SON IN THE SCHOOL AND I NOTICED THAT WHATEVER THE MISSIONARY MIGHT HAVE SAID OR DONE WITH REGARD TO OTHERS HE WAS CAREFUL NOT TO TAKE HIS SON AWAY FROM THE INSTITUTION
3340-169293-0039 I KNEW THAT I WAS RIGHT AND THAT TIME AND THE SOBER SECOND THOUGHT OF THE PEOPLE WOULD VINDICATE ME IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE BISHOPS AND OTHER CHURCH LEADERS BEGAN TO MAKE CAREFUL INVESTIGATION OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE MINISTRY AND THEY FOUND OUT THAT I WAS RIGHT
3340-169293-0040 IN FACT THE OLDEST AND MOST INFLUENTIAL BISHOP IN ONE BRANCH OF THE METHODIST CHURCH SAID THAT MY WORDS WERE FAR TOO MILD VERY SOON PUBLIC SENTIMENT BEGAN MAKING ITSELF FELT IN DEMANDING A PURIFYING OF THE MINISTRY
3340-169293-0041 I HAVE HAD THE SATISFACTION OF HAVING MANY WHO ONCE CONDEMNED ME THANK ME HEARTILY FOR MY FRANK WORDS THE CHANGE OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE NEGRO MINISTRY SO FAR AS REGARDS MYSELF IS SO COMPLETE THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME I HAVE NO WARMER FRIENDS AMONG ANY CLASS THAN I HAVE AMONG THE CLERGYMEN
3340-169293-0042 THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE CHARACTER AND LIFE OF THE NEGRO MINISTERS IS ONE OF THE MOST GRATIFYING EVIDENCES OF THE PROGRESS OF THE RACE MY EXPERIENCE WITH THEM AS WELL AS OTHER EVENTS IN MY LIFE CONVINCE ME THAT THE THING TO DO WHEN ONE FEELS SURE THAT HE HAS SAID OR DONE THE RIGHT THING AND IS CONDEMNED
3340-169293-0043 IS TO STAND STILL AND KEEP QUIET IF HE IS RIGHT TIME WILL SHOW IT IN THE MIDST OF THE DISCUSSION WHICH WAS GOING ON CONCERNING MY ATLANTA SPEECH I RECEIVED THE LETTER WHICH I GIVE BELOW FROM DOCTOR GILMAN THE PRESIDENT OF JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY
3340-169293-0044 WHO HAD BEEN MADE CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDGES OF AWARD IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY BALTIMORE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE DEAR MISTER WASHINGTON
3340-169293-0045 WOULD IT BE AGREEABLE TO YOU TO BE ONE OF THE JUDGES OF AWARD IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AT ATLANTA IF SO I SHALL BE GLAD TO PLACE YOUR NAME UPON THE LIST A LINE BY TELEGRAPH WILL BE WELCOMED YOURS VERY TRULY D C GILMAN
3340-169293-0046 TO PASS NOT ONLY UPON THE EXHIBITS OF THE COLOURED SCHOOLS BUT ALSO UPON THOSE OF THE WHITE SCHOOLS I ACCEPTED THE POSITION AND SPENT A MONTH IN ATLANTA IN PERFORMANCE OF THE DUTIES WHICH IT ENTAILED
3340-169293-0047 THE BOARD OF JURORS WAS A LARGE ONE CONTAINING IN ALL OF SIXTY MEMBERS IT WAS ABOUT EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN SOUTHERN WHITE PEOPLE AND NORTHERN WHITE PEOPLE AMONG THEM WERE COLLEGE PRESIDENTS LEADING SCIENTISTS AND MEN OF LETTERS AND SPECIALISTS IN MANY SUBJECTS
3340-169293-0048 WHEN THE GROUP OF JURORS TO WHICH I WAS ASSIGNED MET FOR ORGANIZATION MISTER THOMAS NELSON PAGE WHO WAS ONE OF THE NUMBER MOVED THAT I BE MADE SECRETARY OF THAT DIVISION AND THE MOTION WAS UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED NEARLY HALF OF OUR DIVISION WERE SOUTHERN PEOPLE
3340-169293-0049 IN PERFORMING MY DUTIES IN THE INSPECTION OF THE EXHIBITS OF WHITE SCHOOLS I WAS IN EVERY CASE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND AT THE CLOSE OF OUR LABOURS I PARTED FROM MY ASSOCIATES WITH REGRET
3340-169293-0050 ALTHOUGH I HAVE NEVER BEFORE SAID SO IN SO MANY WORDS THAT THE TIME WILL COME WHEN THE NEGRO IN THE SOUTH WILL BE ACCORDED ALL THE POLITICAL RIGHTS WHICH HIS ABILITY CHARACTER AND MATERIAL POSSESSIONS ENTITLE HIM TO I THINK THOUGH THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO FREELY EXERCISE SUCH POLITICAL RIGHTS
3340-169293-0051 WILL NOT COME IN ANY LARGE DEGREE THROUGH OUTSIDE OR ARTIFICIAL FORCING BUT WILL BE ACCORDED TO THE NEGRO BY THE SOUTHERN WHITE PEOPLE THEMSELVES
3340-169293-0052 IN FACT THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT IT IS ALREADY BEGINNING IN A SLIGHT DEGREE LET ME ILLUSTRATE MY MEANING SUPPOSE THAT SOME MONTHS BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION THERE HAD BEEN A GENERAL DEMAND FROM THE PRESS AND PUBLIC PLATFORM OUTSIDE THE SOUTH THAT A NEGRO BE GIVEN A PLACE ON THE OPENING PROGRAMME
3340-169293-0053 AND THAT A NEGRO BE PLACED UPON THE BOARD OF JURORS OF AWARD WOULD ANY SUCH RECOGNITION OF THE RACE HAVE TAKEN PLACE I DO NOT THINK SO
3340-169293-0055 I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE NEGRO SHOULD CEASE VOTING FOR A MAN CANNOT LEARN THE EXERCISE OF SELF GOVERNMENT BY CEASING TO VOTE ANY MORE THAN A BOY CAN LEARN TO SWIM BY KEEPING OUT OF THE WATER BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IN HIS VOTING
3340-169293-0056 HE SHOULD MORE AND MORE BE INFLUENCED BY THOSE OF INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER WHO ARE HIS NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOURS I KNOW COLOURED MEN WHO THROUGH THE ENCOURAGEMENT HELP AND ADVICE OF SOUTHERN WHITE PEOPLE
3340-169293-0057 HAVE ACCUMULATED THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF PROPERTY BUT WHO AT THE SAME TIME WOULD NEVER THINK OF GOING TO THOSE SAME PERSONS FOR ADVICE CONCERNING THE CASTING OF THEIR BALLOTS THIS IT SEEMS TO ME IS UNWISE AND UNREASONABLE AND SHOULD CEASE
3340-169293-0058 IN SAYING THIS I DO NOT MEAN THAT THE NEGRO SHOULD TRUCKLE OR NOT VOTE FROM PRINCIPLE FOR THE INSTANT HE CEASES TO VOTE FROM PRINCIPLE HE LOSES THE CONFIDENCE AND RESPECT OF THE SOUTHERN WHITE MAN EVEN
3340-169293-0059 SUCH A LAW IS NOT ONLY UNJUST BUT IT WILL REACT AS ALL UNJUST LAWS DO IN TIME FOR THE EFFECT OF SUCH A LAW IS TO ENCOURAGE THE NEGRO TO SECURE EDUCATION AND PROPERTY AND AT THE SAME TIME IT ENCOURAGES THE WHITE MAN TO REMAIN IN IGNORANCE AND POVERTY
3340-169293-0060 AND THAT THE MAN WHO DOES THIS ENDS HIS CAREER OF DISHONESTY BY THE THEFT OF PROPERTY OR BY SOME EQUALLY SERIOUS CRIME IN MY OPINION THE TIME WILL COME WHEN THE SOUTH WILL ENCOURAGE ALL OF ITS CITIZENS TO VOTE IT WILL SEE THAT IT PAYS BETTER FROM EVERY STANDPOINT TO HAVE HEALTHY VIGOROUS LIFE
3340-169293-0061 THAN TO HAVE THAT POLITICAL STAGNATION WHICH ALWAYS RESULTS WHEN ONE HALF OF THE POPULATION HAS NO SHARE AND NO INTEREST IN THE GOVERNMENT
3340-170982-0000 I SHALL SAY OF THEM WHAT YOU WERE SAYING OF THE OTHERS THAT AS THEY GROW OLDER THEY BECOME RULERS IN THEIR OWN CITY IF THEY CARE TO BE
3340-170982-0001 THEY MARRY WHOM THEY LIKE AND GIVE IN MARRIAGE TO WHOM THEY WILL ALL THAT YOU SAID OF THE OTHERS I NOW SAY OF THESE AND ON THE OTHER HAND OF THE UNJUST I SAY THAT THE GREATER NUMBER
3340-170982-0002 AND YOU MAY SUPPOSE THAT I HAVE REPEATED THE REMAINDER OF YOUR TALE OF HORRORS BUT WILL YOU LET ME ASSUME WITHOUT RECITING THEM THAT THESE THINGS ARE TRUE
3340-170982-0003 CERTAINLY HE SAID WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE THESE THEN ARE THE PRIZES AND REWARDS AND GIFTS WHICH ARE BESTOWED UPON THE JUST BY GODS AND MEN IN THIS PRESENT LIFE IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER GOOD THINGS WHICH JUSTICE OF HERSELF PROVIDES YES HE SAID
3340-170982-0004 AND THEY ARE FAIR AND LASTING AND YET I SAID ALL THESE ARE AS NOTHING EITHER IN NUMBER OR GREATNESS IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE OTHER RECOMPENSES WHICH AWAIT BOTH JUST AND UNJUST AFTER DEATH AND YOU OUGHT TO HEAR THEM
3340-170982-0005 NOT ONE OF THE TALES WHICH ODYSSEUS TELLS TO THE HERO ALCINOUS YET THIS TOO IS A TALE OF A HERO
3340-170982-0006 AND THAT THEY CAME TO A MYSTERIOUS PLACE AT WHICH THERE WERE TWO OPENINGS IN THE EARTH THEY WERE NEAR TOGETHER AND OVER AGAINST THEM WERE TWO OTHER OPENINGS IN THE HEAVEN ABOVE IN THE INTERMEDIATE SPACE THERE WERE JUDGES SEATED
3340-170982-0007 WHO COMMANDED THE JUST AFTER THEY HAD GIVEN JUDGMENT ON THEM AND HAD BOUND THEIR SENTENCES IN FRONT OF THEM TO ASCEND BY THE HEAVENLY WAY ON THE RIGHT HAND AND IN LIKE MANNER THE UNJUST WERE BIDDEN BY THEM TO DESCEND BY THE LOWER WAY ON THE LEFT HAND
3340-170982-0008 THESE ALSO BORE THE SYMBOLS OF THEIR DEEDS BUT FASTENED ON THEIR BACKS HE DREW NEAR AND THEY TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS TO BE THE MESSENGER WHO WOULD CARRY THE REPORT OF THE OTHER WORLD TO MEN AND THEY BADE HIM HEAR AND SEE ALL THAT WAS TO BE HEARD AND SEEN IN THAT PLACE
3340-170982-0009 AND ARRIVING EVER AND ANON THEY SEEMED TO HAVE COME FROM A LONG JOURNEY AND THEY WENT FORTH WITH GLADNESS INTO THE MEADOW WHERE THEY ENCAMPED AS AT A FESTIVAL AND THOSE WHO KNEW ONE ANOTHER EMBRACED AND CONVERSED THE SOULS WHICH CAME FROM EARTH CURIOUSLY ENQUIRING ABOUT THE THINGS ABOVE
3340-170982-0010 THOSE FROM BELOW WEEPING AND SORROWING AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE THINGS WHICH THEY HAD ENDURED AND SEEN IN THEIR JOURNEY BENEATH THE EARTH NOW THE JOURNEY LASTED A THOUSAND YEARS WHILE THOSE FROM ABOVE WERE DESCRIBING HEAVENLY DELIGHTS AND VISIONS OF INCONCEIVABLE BEAUTY
3340-170982-0011 IF FOR EXAMPLE THERE WERE ANY WHO HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF MANY DEATHS OR HAD BETRAYED OR ENSLAVED CITIES OR ARMIES OR BEEN GUILTY OF ANY OTHER EVIL BEHAVIOUR FOR EACH AND ALL OF THEIR OFFENCES THEY RECEIVED PUNISHMENT TEN TIMES OVER
3340-170982-0012 OF PIETY AND IMPIETY TO GODS AND PARENTS AND OF MURDERERS THERE WERE RETRIBUTIONS OTHER AND GREATER FAR WHICH HE DESCRIBED HE MENTIONED THAT HE WAS PRESENT WHEN ONE OF THE SPIRITS ASKED ANOTHER WHERE IS ARDIAEUS THE GREAT
3340-170982-0013 NOW THIS ARDIAEUS LIVED A THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE TIME OF ER HE HAD BEEN THE TYRANT OF SOME CITY OF PAMPHYLIA AND HAD MURDERED HIS AGED FATHER AND HIS ELDER BROTHER AND WAS SAID TO HAVE COMMITTED MANY OTHER ABOMINABLE CRIMES THE ANSWER OF THE OTHER SPIRIT WAS
3340-170982-0014 HE COMES NOT HITHER AND WILL NEVER COME AND THIS SAID HE WAS ONE OF THE DREADFUL SIGHTS WHICH WE OURSELVES WITNESSED WE WERE AT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVERN AND HAVING COMPLETED ALL OUR EXPERIENCES WERE ABOUT TO REASCEND WHEN OF A SUDDEN ARDIAEUS APPEARED AND SEVERAL OTHERS
3340-170982-0015 MOST OF WHOM WERE TYRANTS AND THERE WERE ALSO BESIDES THE TYRANTS PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD BEEN GREAT CRIMINALS
3340-170982-0016 THEY WERE JUST AS THEY FANCIED ABOUT TO RETURN INTO THE UPPER WORLD BUT THE MOUTH INSTEAD OF ADMITTING THEM GAVE A ROAR WHENEVER ANY OF THESE INCURABLE SINNERS OR SOME ONE WHO HAD NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY PUNISHED TRIED TO ASCEND
3340-170982-0017 AND THEN WILD MEN OF FIERY ASPECT WHO WERE STANDING BY AND HEARD THE SOUND SEIZED AND CARRIED THEM OFF
3340-170982-0018 AND THREW THEM DOWN AND FLAYED THEM WITH SCOURGES AND DRAGGED THEM ALONG THE ROAD AT THE SIDE CARDING THEM ON THORNS LIKE WOOL AND DECLARING TO THE PASSERS BY WHAT WERE THEIR CRIMES AND THAT THEY WERE BEING TAKEN AWAY TO BE CAST INTO HELL AND OF ALL THE MANY TERRORS WHICH THEY HAD ENDURED HE SAID THAT
3340-170982-0019 AND WHEN THERE WAS SILENCE ONE BY ONE THEY ASCENDED WITH EXCEEDING JOY THESE SAID ER WERE THE PENALTIES AND RETRIBUTIONS AND THERE WERE BLESSINGS AS GREAT
3340-170982-0020 ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER HE SAID THAT THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD SEE FROM ABOVE A LINE OF LIGHT STRAIGHT AS A COLUMN
3340-170982-0021 FROM THESE ENDS IS EXTENDED THE SPINDLE OF NECESSITY ON WHICH ALL THE REVOLUTIONS TURN THE SHAFT AND HOOK OF THIS SPINDLE ARE MADE OF STEEL AND THE WHORL IS MADE PARTLY OF STEEL AND ALSO PARTLY OF OTHER MATERIALS
3340-170982-0022 NOW THE WHORL IS IN FORM LIKE THE WHORL USED ON EARTH AND THE DESCRIPTION OF IT IMPLIED THAT THERE IS ONE LARGE HOLLOW WHORL WHICH IS QUITE SCOOPED OUT AND INTO THIS IS FITTED ANOTHER LESSER ONE AND ANOTHER
3340-170982-0023 AND ANOTHER AND FOUR OTHERS MAKING EIGHT IN ALL LIKE VESSELS WHICH FIT INTO ONE ANOTHER THE WHORLS SHOW THEIR EDGES ON THE UPPER SIDE AND ON THEIR LOWER SIDE ALL TOGETHER FORM ONE CONTINUOUS WHORL THIS IS PIERCED BY THE SPINDLE WHICH IS DRIVEN HOME THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE EIGHTH
3340-170982-0024 THE SIXTH IS NEXT TO THE FIRST IN SIZE THE FOURTH NEXT TO THE SIXTH THEN COMES THE EIGHTH THE SEVENTH IS FIFTH THE FIFTH IS SIXTH THE THIRD IS SEVENTH LAST AND EIGHTH COMES THE SECOND THE LARGEST OR FIXED STARS IS SPANGLED AND THE SEVENTH
3340-170982-0025 OR SUN IS BRIGHTEST THE EIGHTH OR MOON COLOURED BY THE REFLECTED LIGHT OF THE SEVENTH THE SECOND AND FIFTH SATURN AND MERCURY ARE IN COLOUR LIKE ONE ANOTHER AND YELLOWER THAN THE PRECEDING THE THIRD VENUS HAS THE WHITEST LIGHT
3340-170982-0026 THE FOURTH MARS IS REDDISH THE SIXTH JUPITER IS IN WHITENESS SECOND NOW THE WHOLE SPINDLE HAS THE SAME MOTION BUT AS THE WHOLE REVOLVES IN ONE DIRECTION THE SEVEN INNER CIRCLES MOVE SLOWLY IN THE OTHER AND OF THESE THE SWIFTEST IS THE EIGHTH
3340-170982-0027 THE THIRD APPEARED FOURTH AND THE SECOND FIFTH THE SPINDLE TURNS ON THE KNEES OF NECESSITY AND ON THE UPPER SURFACE OF EACH CIRCLE IS A SIREN WHO GOES ROUND WITH THEM HYMNING A SINGLE TONE OR NOTE THE EIGHT TOGETHER FORM ONE HARMONY
3340-170982-0028 WHO ACCOMPANY WITH THEIR VOICES THE HARMONY OF THE SIRENS LACHESIS SINGING OF THE PAST CLOTHO OF THE PRESENT
3340-170982-0029 CLOTHO FROM TIME TO TIME
3340-170982-0030 AND LACHESIS LAYING HOLD OF EITHER IN TURN FIRST WITH ONE HAND AND THEN WITH THE OTHER WHEN ER AND THE SPIRITS ARRIVED THEIR DUTY WAS TO GO AT ONCE TO LACHESIS
3340-170982-0031 MORTAL SOULS BEHOLD A NEW CYCLE OF LIFE AND MORTALITY YOUR GENIUS WILL NOT BE ALLOTTED TO YOU BUT YOU WILL CHOOSE YOUR GENIUS AND LET HIM WHO DRAWS THE FIRST LOT HAVE THE FIRST CHOICE AND THE LIFE WHICH HE CHOOSES SHALL BE HIS DESTINY
3340-170982-0032 VIRTUE IS FREE AND AS A MAN HONOURS OR DISHONOURS HER HE WILL HAVE MORE OR LESS OF HER THE RESPONSIBILITY IS WITH THE CHOOSER GOD IS JUSTIFIED
3340-170982-0033 WHEN THE INTERPRETER HAD THUS SPOKEN HE SCATTERED LOTS INDIFFERENTLY AMONG THEM ALL AND EACH OF THEM TOOK UP THE LOT WHICH FELL NEAR HIM ALL BUT ER HIMSELF HE WAS NOT ALLOWED AND EACH AS HE TOOK HIS LOT PERCEIVED THE NUMBER WHICH HE HAD OBTAINED
3340-170982-0034 THEN THE INTERPRETER PLACED ON THE GROUND BEFORE THEM THE SAMPLES OF LIVES AND THERE WERE MANY MORE LIVES THAN THE SOULS PRESENT AND THEY WERE OF ALL SORTS THERE WERE LIVES OF EVERY ANIMAL AND OF MAN IN EVERY CONDITION AND THERE WERE TYRANNIES AMONG THEM SOME LASTING OUT THE TYRANT'S LIFE
3340-170982-0035 OTHERS WHICH BROKE OFF IN THE MIDDLE AND CAME TO AN END IN POVERTY AND EXILE AND BEGGARY AND THERE WERE LIVES OF FAMOUS MEN SOME WHO WERE FAMOUS FOR THEIR FORM AND BEAUTY AS WELL AS FOR THEIR STRENGTH AND SUCCESS IN GAMES OR AGAIN FOR THEIR BIRTH AND THE QUALITIES OF THEIR ANCESTORS
3340-170982-0036 AND SOME WHO WERE THE REVERSE OF FAMOUS FOR THE OPPOSITE QUALITIES AND OF WOMEN LIKEWISE THERE WAS NOT HOWEVER ANY DEFINITE CHARACTER IN THEM BECAUSE THE SOUL WHEN CHOOSING A NEW LIFE MUST OF NECESSITY BECOME DIFFERENT
3340-170982-0037 AND SO TO CHOOSE ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE THE BETTER LIFE AS HE HAS OPPORTUNITY HE SHOULD CONSIDER THE BEARING OF ALL THESE THINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN MENTIONED SEVERALLY AND COLLECTIVELY UPON VIRTUE
3340-170982-0038 OF STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS OF CLEVERNESS AND DULLNESS AND OF ALL THE NATURAL AND ACQUIRED GIFTS OF THE SOUL AND THE OPERATION OF THEM WHEN CONJOINED
3340-170982-0039 AND GOOD TO THE LIFE WHICH WILL MAKE HIS SOUL MORE JUST ALL ELSE HE WILL DISREGARD
3340-170982-0040 FOR WE HAVE SEEN AND KNOW THAT THIS IS THE BEST CHOICE BOTH IN LIFE AND AFTER DEATH A MAN MUST TAKE WITH HIM INTO THE WORLD BELOW AN ADAMANTINE FAITH IN TRUTH AND RIGHT THAT THERE TOO HE MAY BE UNDAZZLED BY THE DESIRE OF WEALTH OR THE OTHER ALLUREMENTS OF EVIL
3340-170982-0041 NOT ONLY IN THIS LIFE BUT IN ALL THAT WHICH IS TO COME FOR THIS IS THE WAY OF HAPPINESS AND ACCORDING TO THE REPORT OF THE MESSENGER FROM THE OTHER WORLD THIS WAS WHAT THE PROPHET SAID AT THE TIME EVEN FOR THE LAST COMER IF HE CHOOSES WISELY AND WILL LIVE DILIGENTLY
3340-170982-0042 THERE IS APPOINTED A HAPPY AND NOT UNDESIRABLE EXISTENCE LET NOT HIM WHO CHOOSES FIRST BE CARELESS AND LET NOT THE LAST DESPAIR
3340-170982-0043 AND WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN HE WHO HAD THE FIRST CHOICE CAME FORWARD AND IN A MOMENT CHOSE THE GREATEST TYRANNY HIS MIND HAVING BEEN DARKENED BY FOLLY AND SENSUALITY HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OUT THE WHOLE MATTER BEFORE HE CHOSE
3340-170982-0044 AND DID NOT AT FIRST SIGHT PERCEIVE THAT HE WAS FATED AMONG OTHER EVILS TO DEVOUR HIS OWN CHILDREN BUT WHEN HE HAD TIME TO REFLECT AND SAW WHAT WAS IN THE LOT HE BEGAN TO BEAT HIS BREAST AND LAMENT OVER HIS CHOICE FORGETTING THE PROCLAMATION OF THE PROPHET
3340-170982-0045 FOR INSTEAD OF THROWING THE BLAME OF HIS MISFORTUNE ON HIMSELF HE ACCUSED CHANCE AND THE GODS AND EVERYTHING RATHER THAN HIMSELF NOW HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO CAME FROM HEAVEN AND IN A FORMER LIFE HAD DWELT IN A WELL ORDERED STATE BUT HIS VIRTUE WAS A MATTER OF HABIT ONLY AND HE HAD NO PHILOSOPHY
3340-170982-0046 AND IT WAS TRUE OF OTHERS WHO WERE SIMILARLY OVERTAKEN THAT THE GREATER NUMBER OF THEM CAME FROM HEAVEN AND THEREFORE THEY HAD NEVER BEEN SCHOOLED BY TRIAL WHEREAS THE PILGRIMS WHO CAME FROM EARTH HAVING THEMSELVES SUFFERED AND SEEN OTHERS SUFFER WERE NOT IN A HURRY TO CHOOSE
3340-170982-0047 AND HAD BEEN MODERATELY FORTUNATE IN THE NUMBER OF THE LOT HE MIGHT AS THE MESSENGER REPORTED BE HAPPY HERE AND ALSO HIS JOURNEY TO ANOTHER LIFE AND RETURN TO THIS INSTEAD OF BEING ROUGH AND UNDERGROUND WOULD BE SMOOTH AND HEAVENLY MOST CURIOUS HE SAID WAS THE SPECTACLE
3340-170982-0048 SAD AND LAUGHABLE AND STRANGE FOR THE CHOICE OF THE SOULS WAS IN MOST CASES BASED ON THEIR EXPERIENCE OF A PREVIOUS LIFE THERE HE SAW THE SOUL WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN ORPHEUS CHOOSING THE LIFE OF A SWAN OUT OF ENMITY TO THE RACE OF WOMEN
3340-170982-0049 HATING TO BE BORN OF A WOMAN BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN HIS MURDERERS HE BEHELD ALSO THE SOUL OF THAMYRAS CHOOSING THE LIFE OF A NIGHTINGALE BIRDS ON THE OTHER HAND LIKE THE SWAN AND OTHER MUSICIANS WANTING TO BE MEN
3340-170982-0050 WHO TOOK THE LIFE OF AN EAGLE BECAUSE LIKE AJAX HE HATED HUMAN NATURE BY REASON OF HIS SUFFERINGS ABOUT THE MIDDLE CAME THE LOT OF ATALANTA SHE SEEING THE GREAT FAME OF AN ATHLETE WAS UNABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION
3340-170982-0051 AND AFTER HER THERE FOLLOWED THE SOUL OF EPEUS THE SON OF PANOPEUS PASSING INTO THE NATURE OF A WOMAN CUNNING IN THE ARTS AND FAR AWAY AMONG THE LAST WHO CHOSE THE SOUL OF THE JESTER THERSITES WAS PUTTING ON THE FORM OF A MONKEY
3340-170982-0052 HE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THIS WHICH WAS LYING ABOUT AND HAD BEEN NEGLECTED BY EVERYBODY ELSE AND WHEN HE SAW IT HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME HAD HIS LOT BEEN FIRST INSTEAD OF LAST AND THAT HE WAS DELIGHTED TO HAVE IT AND NOT ONLY DID MEN PASS INTO ANIMALS
3340-170982-0053 BUT I MUST ALSO MENTION THAT THERE WERE ANIMALS TAME AND WILD WHO CHANGED INTO ONE ANOTHER AND INTO CORRESPONDING HUMAN NATURES THE GOOD INTO THE GENTLE AND THE EVIL INTO THE SAVAGE IN ALL SORTS OF COMBINATIONS ALL THE SOULS HAD NOW CHOSEN THEIR LIVES
3340-170982-0054 AND THEY WENT IN THE ORDER OF THEIR CHOICE TO LACHESIS WHO SENT WITH THEM THE GENIUS WHOM THEY HAD SEVERALLY CHOSEN TO BE THE GUARDIAN OF THEIR LIVES AND THE FULFILLER OF THE CHOICE THIS GENIUS LED THE SOULS FIRST TO CLOTHO AND DREW THEM WITHIN THE REVOLUTION OF THE SPINDLE IMPELLED BY HER HAND
3340-170982-0055 WHENCE WITHOUT TURNING ROUND THEY PASSED BENEATH THE THRONE OF NECESSITY
3340-170982-0056 AND WHEN THEY HAD ALL PASSED THEY MARCHED ON IN A SCORCHING HEAT TO THE PLAIN OF FORGETFULNESS WHICH WAS A BARREN WASTE DESTITUTE OF TREES AND VERDURE AND THEN TOWARDS EVENING THEY ENCAMPED BY THE RIVER OF UNMINDFULNESS WHOSE WATER NO VESSEL CAN HOLD
3340-170982-0057 OF THIS THEY WERE ALL OBLIGED TO DRINK A CERTAIN QUANTITY AND THOSE WHO WERE NOT SAVED BY WISDOM DRANK MORE THAN WAS NECESSARY AND EACH ONE AS HE DRANK FORGOT ALL THINGS NOW AFTER THEY HAD GONE TO REST ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THERE WAS A THUNDERSTORM AND EARTHQUAKE
3340-170982-0058 AND WE SHALL PASS SAFELY OVER THE RIVER OF FORGETFULNESS AND OUR SOUL WILL NOT BE DEFILED WHEREFORE MY COUNSEL IS THAT WE HOLD FAST EVER TO THE HEAVENLY WAY AND FOLLOW AFTER JUSTICE AND VIRTUE ALWAYS
3347-134420-0000 CHAPTER FIFTY EIGHT IN WHICH ONE SCENE OF THIS HISTORY IS CLOSED DIVIDING THE DISTANCE INTO TWO DAYS JOURNEY IN ORDER THAT HIS CHARGE MIGHT SUSTAIN THE LESS EXHAUSTION AND FATIGUE FROM TRAVELLING SO FAR
3347-134420-0001 NICHOLAS AT THE END OF THE SECOND DAY FROM THEIR LEAVING HOME FOUND HIMSELF WITHIN A VERY FEW MILES OF THE SPOT WHERE THE HAPPIEST YEARS OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED AND WHICH WHILE IT FILLED HIS MIND WITH PLEASANT AND PEACEFUL THOUGHTS
3347-134420-0002 BROUGHT BACK MANY PAINFUL AND VIVID RECOLLECTIONS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE AND HIS HAD WANDERED FORTH FROM THEIR OLD HOME CAST UPON THE ROUGH WORLD AND THE MERCY OF STRANGERS IT NEEDED NO SUCH REFLECTIONS AS THOSE WHICH THE MEMORY OF OLD DAYS
3347-134420-0003 AND WANDERINGS AMONG SCENES WHERE OUR CHILDHOOD HAS BEEN PASSED USUALLY AWAKEN IN THE MOST INSENSIBLE MINDS TO SOFTEN THE HEART OF NICHOLAS AND RENDER HIM MORE THAN USUALLY MINDFUL OF HIS DROOPING FRIEND BY NIGHT AND DAY
3347-134420-0004 AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS ALWAYS WATCHFUL ATTENTIVE AND SOLICITOUS AND NEVER VARYING IN THE DISCHARGE OF HIS SELF IMPOSED DUTY TO ONE SO FRIENDLESS AND HELPLESS AS HE WHOSE SANDS OF LIFE WERE NOW FAST RUNNING OUT
3347-134420-0005 AND DWINDLING RAPIDLY AWAY HE WAS EVER AT HIS SIDE HE NEVER LEFT HIM TO ENCOURAGE AND ANIMATE HIM ADMINISTER TO HIS WANTS SUPPORT AND CHEER HIM TO THE UTMOST OF HIS POWER WAS NOW HIS CONSTANT AND UNCEASING OCCUPATION
3347-134420-0006 THEY PROCURED A HUMBLE LODGING IN A SMALL FARMHOUSE SURROUNDED BY MEADOWS WHERE NICHOLAS HAD OFTEN REVELLED WHEN A CHILD WITH A TROOP OF MERRY SCHOOLFELLOWS AND HERE THEY TOOK UP THEIR REST AT FIRST SMIKE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO WALK ABOUT
3347-134420-0007 YIELDING TO THIS FANCY AND PLEASED TO FIND THAT ITS INDULGENCE BEGUILED THE SICK BOY OF MANY TEDIOUS HOURS AND NEVER FAILED TO AFFORD HIM MATTER FOR THOUGHT AND CONVERSATION AFTERWARDS NICHOLAS MADE SUCH SPOTS THE SCENES OF THEIR DAILY RAMBLES
3347-134420-0008 DRIVING HIM FROM PLACE TO PLACE IN A LITTLE PONY CHAIR AND SUPPORTING HIM ON HIS ARM WHILE THEY WALKED SLOWLY AMONG THESE OLD HAUNTS OR LINGERED IN THE SUNLIGHT TO TAKE LONG PARTING LOOKS OF THOSE WHICH WERE MOST QUIET AND BEAUTIFUL
3347-134420-0009 IT WAS ON SUCH OCCASIONS AS THESE THAT NICHOLAS YIELDING ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY TO THE INTEREST OF OLD ASSOCIATIONS WOULD POINT OUT SOME TREE THAT HE HAD CLIMBED A HUNDRED TIMES TO PEEP AT THE YOUNG BIRDS IN THEIR NEST
3347-134420-0010 AND THE BRANCH FROM WHICH HE USED TO SHOUT TO LITTLE KATE WHO STOOD BELOW TERRIFIED AT THE HEIGHT HE HAD GAINED AND YET URGING HIM HIGHER STILL BY THE INTENSITY OF HER ADMIRATION THERE WAS THE OLD HOUSE TOO WHICH THEY WOULD PASS EVERY DAY
3347-134420-0011 LOOKING UP AT THE TINY WINDOW THROUGH WHICH THE SUN USED TO STREAM IN AND WAKE HIM ON THE SUMMER MORNINGS THEY WERE ALL SUMMER MORNINGS THEN AND CLIMBING UP THE GARDEN WALL AND LOOKING OVER NICHOLAS COULD SEE THE VERY ROSE BUSH WHICH HAD COME A PRESENT TO KATE FROM SOME LITTLE LOVER
3347-134420-0013 WITH WHICH SOME CHILDISH EVENT WAS NOT ENTWINED AND BACK IT CAME UPON THE MIND AS EVENTS OF CHILDHOOD DO NOTHING IN ITSELF PERHAPS A WORD A LAUGH A LOOK SOME SLIGHT DISTRESS A PASSING THOUGHT OR FEAR
3347-134420-0014 AND YET MORE STRONGLY AND DISTINCTLY MARKED AND BETTER REMEMBERED THAN THE HARDEST TRIALS OR SEVEREST SORROWS OF A YEAR AGO ONE OF THESE EXPEDITIONS LED THEM THROUGH THE CHURCHYARD WHERE WAS HIS FATHER'S GRAVE
3347-134420-0015 EVEN HERE SAID NICHOLAS SOFTLY WE USED TO LOITER BEFORE WE KNEW WHAT DEATH WAS AND WHEN WE LITTLE THOUGHT WHOSE ASHES WOULD REST BENEATH AND WONDERING AT THE SILENCE SIT DOWN TO REST AND SPEAK BELOW OUR BREATH
3347-134420-0016 ONCE KATE WAS LOST AND AFTER AN HOUR OF FRUITLESS SEARCH THEY FOUND HER FAST ASLEEP UNDER THAT TREE WHICH SHADES MY FATHER'S GRAVE HE WAS VERY FOND OF HER AND SAID WHEN HE TOOK HER UP IN HIS ARMS STILL SLEEPING
3347-134420-0017 THAT WHENEVER HE DIED HE WOULD WISH TO BE BURIED WHERE HIS DEAR LITTLE CHILD HAD LAID HER HEAD YOU SEE HIS WISH WAS NOT FORGOTTEN NOTHING MORE PASSED AT THE TIME BUT THAT NIGHT AS NICHOLAS SAT BESIDE HIS BED
3347-134420-0018 SMIKE STARTED FROM WHAT HAD SEEMED TO BE A SLUMBER AND LAYING HIS HAND IN HIS PRAYED AS THE TEARS COURSED DOWN HIS FACE THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIM ONE SOLEMN PROMISE WHAT IS THAT SAID NICHOLAS KINDLY
3347-134420-0019 IF I CAN REDEEM IT OR HOPE TO DO SO YOU KNOW I WILL I AM SURE YOU WILL WAS THE REPLY PROMISE ME THAT WHEN I DIE I SHALL BE BURIED NEAR AS NEAR AS THEY CAN MAKE MY GRAVE TO THE TREE WE SAW TODAY
3347-134420-0020 NICHOLAS GAVE THE PROMISE HE HAD FEW WORDS TO GIVE IT IN BUT THEY WERE SOLEMN AND EARNEST HIS POOR FRIEND KEPT HIS HAND IN HIS AND TURNED AS IF TO SLEEP BUT THERE WERE STIFLED SOBS
3347-134420-0021 AND THE HAND WAS PRESSED MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE OR THRICE BEFORE HE SANK TO REST AND SLOWLY LOOSED HIS HOLD IN A FORTNIGHT'S TIME HE BECAME TOO ILL TO MOVE ABOUT ONCE OR TWICE NICHOLAS DROVE HIM OUT
3347-134420-0022 PROPPED UP WITH PILLOWS BUT THE MOTION OF THE CHAISE WAS PAINFUL TO HIM AND BROUGHT ON FITS OF FAINTING WHICH IN HIS WEAKENED STATE WERE DANGEROUS THERE WAS AN OLD COUCH IN THE HOUSE WHICH WAS HIS FAVOURITE RESTING PLACE BY DAY AND WHEN THE SUN SHONE
3347-134420-0023 AND THE WEATHER WAS WARM NICHOLAS HAD THIS WHEELED INTO A LITTLE ORCHARD WHICH WAS CLOSE AT HAND AND HIS CHARGE BEING WELL WRAPPED UP AND CARRIED OUT TO IT THEY USED TO SIT THERE SOMETIMES FOR HOURS TOGETHER IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS THAT A CIRCUMSTANCE TOOK PLACE
3347-134420-0024 WHICH NICHOLAS AT THE TIME THOROUGHLY BELIEVED TO BE THE MERE DELUSION OF AN IMAGINATION AFFECTED BY DISEASE BUT WHICH HE HAD AFTERWARDS TOO GOOD REASON TO KNOW WAS OF REAL AND ACTUAL OCCURRENCE
3347-134420-0025 HE HAD BROUGHT SMIKE OUT IN HIS ARMS POOR FELLOW A CHILD MIGHT HAVE CARRIED HIM THEN TO SEE THE SUNSET AND HAVING ARRANGED HIS COUCH HAD TAKEN HIS SEAT BESIDE IT HE HAD BEEN WATCHING THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT BEFORE
3347-134420-0026 AND BEING GREATLY FATIGUED BOTH IN MIND AND BODY GRADUALLY FELL ASLEEP HE COULD NOT HAVE CLOSED HIS EYES FIVE MINUTES WHEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY A SCREAM AND STARTING UP IN THAT KIND OF TERROR WHICH AFFECTS A PERSON SUDDENLY ROUSED
3347-134420-0027 SAW TO HIS GREAT ASTONISHMENT THAT HIS CHARGE HAD STRUGGLED INTO A SITTING POSTURE AND WITH EYES ALMOST STARTING FROM THEIR SOCKETS COLD DEW STANDING ON HIS FOREHEAD AND IN A FIT OF TREMBLING WHICH QUITE CONVULSED HIS FRAME
3347-134420-0028 WAS CALLING TO HIM FOR HELP GOOD HEAVEN WHAT IS THIS SAID NICHOLAS BENDING OVER HIM BE CALM YOU HAVE BEEN DREAMING NO NO NO CRIED SMIKE CLINGING TO HIM HOLD ME TIGHT DON'T LET ME GO
3347-134420-0029 BEHIND THE TREE NICHOLAS FOLLOWED HIS EYES WHICH WERE DIRECTED TO SOME DISTANCE BEHIND THE CHAIR FROM WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD JUST RISEN
3347-134420-0030 AS HE STROVE TO COMPOSE HIM NOTHING ELSE INDEED I KNOW BETTER I SAW AS PLAIN AS I SEE NOW WAS THE ANSWER OH SAY YOU'LL KEEP ME WITH YOU SWEAR YOU WON'T LEAVE ME FOR AN INSTANT DO I EVER LEAVE YOU RETURNED NICHOLAS
3347-134420-0031 LIE DOWN AGAIN THERE YOU SEE I'M HERE NOW TELL ME WHAT WAS IT DO YOU REMEMBER SAID SMIKE IN A LOW VOICE AND GLANCING FEARFULLY ROUND
3347-134420-0032 DO YOU REMEMBER MY TELLING YOU OF THE MAN WHO FIRST TOOK ME TO THE SCHOOL YES SURELY I RAISED MY EYES JUST NOW TOWARDS THAT TREE THAT ONE WITH THE THICK TRUNK AND THERE WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON ME HE STOOD
3347-134420-0033 GRANTING FOR AN INSTANT THAT IT'S LIKELY HE IS ALIVE AND WANDERING ABOUT A LONELY PLACE LIKE THIS SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE PUBLIC ROAD DO YOU THINK THAT AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME YOU COULD POSSIBLY KNOW THAT MAN AGAIN ANYWHERE
3347-134420-0034 IN ANY DRESS RETURNED SMIKE BUT JUST NOW HE STOOD LEANING UPON HIS STICK AND LOOKING AT ME EXACTLY AS I TOLD YOU I REMEMBERED HIM HE WAS DUSTY WITH WALKING AND POORLY DRESSED I THINK HIS CLOTHES WERE RAGGED BUT DIRECTLY I SAW HIM
3347-134420-0035 THE WET NIGHT HIS FACE WHEN HE LEFT ME THE PARLOUR I WAS LEFT IN AND THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE ALL SEEMED TO COME BACK TOGETHER WHEN HE KNEW I SAW HIM HE LOOKED FRIGHTENED FOR HE STARTED AND SHRUNK AWAY I HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM BY DAY AND DREAMT OF HIM BY NIGHT
3347-134420-0036 HE LOOKED IN MY SLEEP WHEN I WAS QUITE A LITTLE CHILD AND HAS LOOKED IN MY SLEEP EVER SINCE AS HE DID JUST NOW NICHOLAS ENDEAVOURED BY EVERY PERSUASION AND ARGUMENT HE COULD THINK OF TO CONVINCE THE TERRIFIED CREATURE THAT HIS IMAGINATION HAD DECEIVED HIM
3347-134420-0037 AND THAT THIS CLOSE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE CREATION OF HIS DREAMS AND THE MAN HE SUPPOSED HE HAD SEEN WAS BUT A PROOF OF IT BUT ALL IN VAIN WHEN HE COULD PERSUADE HIM TO REMAIN FOR A FEW MOMENTS IN THE CARE OF THE PEOPLE TO WHOM THE HOUSE BELONGED
3347-134420-0038 HE INSTITUTED A STRICT INQUIRY WHETHER ANY STRANGER HAD BEEN SEEN AND SEARCHED HIMSELF BEHIND THE TREE AND THROUGH THE ORCHARD AND UPON THE LAND IMMEDIATELY ADJOINING AND IN EVERY PLACE NEAR WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR A MAN TO LIE CONCEALED BUT ALL IN VAIN
3347-134420-0039 SATISFIED THAT HE WAS RIGHT IN HIS ORIGINAL CONJECTURE HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO CALMING THE FEARS OF SMIKE WHICH AFTER SOME TIME HE PARTIALLY SUCCEEDED IN DOING THOUGH NOT IN REMOVING THE IMPRESSION UPON HIS MIND
3347-134420-0040 FOR HE STILL DECLARED AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THE MOST SOLEMN AND FERVID MANNER THAT HE HAD POSITIVELY SEEN WHAT HE HAD DESCRIBED AND THAT NOTHING COULD EVER REMOVE HIS CONVICTION OF ITS REALITY AND NOW
3347-134420-0041 NICHOLAS BEGAN TO SEE THAT HOPE WAS GONE AND THAT UPON THE PARTNER OF HIS POVERTY AND THE SHARER OF HIS BETTER FORTUNE THE WORLD WAS CLOSING FAST THERE WAS LITTLE PAIN LITTLE UNEASINESS BUT THERE WAS NO RALLYING NO EFFORT
3347-134420-0042 NO STRUGGLE FOR LIFE HE WAS WORN AND WASTED TO THE LAST DEGREE HIS VOICE HAD SUNK SO LOW THAT HE COULD SCARCE BE HEARD TO SPEAK NATURE WAS THOROUGHLY EXHAUSTED AND HE HAD LAIN HIM DOWN TO DIE
3347-134420-0043 ON A FINE MILD AUTUMN DAY WHEN ALL WAS TRANQUIL AND AT PEACE WHEN THE SOFT SWEET AIR CREPT IN AT THE OPEN WINDOW OF THE QUIET ROOM AND NOT A SOUND WAS HEARD BUT THE GENTLE RUSTLING OF THE LEAVES
3347-134420-0044 NICHOLAS SAT IN HIS OLD PLACE BY THE BEDSIDE AND KNEW THAT THE TIME WAS NEARLY COME SO VERY STILL IT WAS THAT EVERY NOW AND THEN HE BENT DOWN HIS EAR TO LISTEN FOR THE BREATHING OF HIM WHO LAY ASLEEP
3347-134420-0045 AS IF TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT LIFE WAS STILL THERE AND THAT HE HAD NOT FALLEN INTO THAT DEEP SLUMBER FROM WHICH ON EARTH THERE IS NO WAKING WHILE HE WAS THUS EMPLOYED THE CLOSED EYES OPENED AND ON THE PALE FACE THERE CAME A PLACID SMILE
3347-134420-0046 THAT'S WELL SAID NICHOLAS THE SLEEP HAS DONE YOU GOOD I HAVE HAD SUCH PLEASANT DREAMS WAS THE ANSWER SUCH PLEASANT HAPPY DREAMS OF WHAT SAID NICHOLAS THE DYING BOY TURNED TOWARDS HIM
3347-134420-0047 AND PUTTING HIS ARM ABOUT HIS NECK MADE ANSWER I SHALL SOON BE THERE AFTER A SHORT SILENCE HE SPOKE AGAIN I AM NOT AFRAID TO DIE HE SAID I AM QUITE CONTENTED
3347-134420-0048 I ALMOST THINK THAT IF I COULD RISE FROM THIS BED QUITE WELL I WOULD NOT WISH TO DO SO NOW YOU HAVE SO OFTEN TOLD ME WE SHALL MEET AGAIN SO VERY OFTEN LATELY AND NOW I FEEL THE TRUTH OF THAT SO STRONGLY THAT I CAN EVEN BEAR TO PART FROM YOU
3347-134420-0049 THE TREMBLING VOICE AND TEARFUL EYE AND THE CLOSER GRASP OF THE ARM WHICH ACCOMPANIED THESE LATTER WORDS SHOWED HOW THEY FILLED THE SPEAKER'S HEART NOR WERE THERE WANTING INDICATIONS OF HOW DEEPLY THEY HAD TOUCHED THE HEART OF HIM TO WHOM THEY WERE ADDRESSED
3347-134420-0050 YOU SAY WELL RETURNED NICHOLAS AT LENGTH AND COMFORT ME VERY MUCH DEAR FELLOW LET ME HEAR YOU SAY YOU ARE HAPPY IF YOU CAN I MUST TELL YOU SOMETHING FIRST I SHOULD NOT HAVE A SECRET FROM YOU
3347-134420-0051 YOU WOULD NOT BLAME ME AT A TIME LIKE THIS I KNOW I BLAME YOU EXCLAIMED NICHOLAS I AM SURE YOU WOULD NOT YOU ASKED ME WHY I WAS SO CHANGED AND AND SAT SO MUCH ALONE SHALL I TELL YOU WHY
3347-134420-0052 NOT IF IT PAINS YOU SAID NICHOLAS I ONLY ASKED THAT I MIGHT MAKE YOU HAPPIER IF I COULD I KNOW I FELT THAT AT THE TIME HE DREW HIS FRIEND CLOSER TO HIM YOU WILL FORGIVE ME I COULD NOT HELP IT
3347-134420-0053 IT BROKE MY HEART TO SEE I KNOW HE LOVES HER DEARLY OH WHO COULD FIND THAT OUT SO SOON AS I THE WORDS WHICH FOLLOWED WERE FEEBLY AND FAINTLY UTTERED AND BROKEN BY LONG PAUSES
3347-134420-0054 BUT FROM THEM NICHOLAS LEARNT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE DYING BOY WITH ALL THE ARDOUR OF A NATURE CONCENTRATED ON ONE ABSORBING HOPELESS SECRET PASSION LOVED HIS SISTER KATE HE HAD PROCURED A LOCK OF HER HAIR
3347-134420-0055 WHICH HUNG AT HIS BREAST FOLDED IN ONE OR TWO SLIGHT RIBBONS SHE HAD WORN HE PRAYED THAT WHEN HE WAS DEAD NICHOLAS WOULD TAKE IT OFF SO THAT NO EYES BUT HIS MIGHT SEE IT AND THAT WHEN HE WAS LAID IN HIS COFFIN AND ABOUT TO BE PLACED IN THE EARTH
3347-134420-0056 HE WOULD HANG IT ROUND HIS NECK AGAIN THAT IT MIGHT REST WITH HIM IN THE GRAVE UPON HIS KNEES NICHOLAS GAVE HIM THIS PLEDGE
3347-134420-0057 AND KISSED EACH OTHER ON THE CHEEK NOW HE MURMURED I AM HAPPY HE FELL INTO A LIGHT SLUMBER AND WAKING SMILED AS BEFORE THEN SPOKE OF BEAUTIFUL GARDENS WHICH HE SAID STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HIM
3347-134420-0058 AND WERE FILLED WITH FIGURES OF MEN WOMEN AND MANY CHILDREN ALL WITH LIGHT UPON THEIR FACES THEN WHISPERED THAT IT WAS EDEN
3347-134425-0000 THE BROTHERS CHEERYBLE MAKE VARIOUS DECLARATIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND OTHERS TIM LINKINWATER MAKES A DECLARATION FOR HIMSELF SOME WEEKS HAD PASSED AND THE FIRST SHOCK OF THESE EVENTS HAD SUBSIDED
3347-134425-0001 MADELINE HAD BEEN REMOVED FRANK HAD BEEN ABSENT AND NICHOLAS AND KATE HAD BEGUN TO TRY IN GOOD EARNEST TO STIFLE THEIR OWN REGRETS AND TO LIVE FOR EACH OTHER AND FOR THEIR MOTHER WHO POOR LADY
3347-134425-0002 WHEN THERE CAME ONE EVENING PER FAVOUR OF MISTER LINKINWATER AN INVITATION FROM THE BROTHERS TO DINNER ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE COMPREHENDING NOT ONLY MISSUS NICKLEBY KATE AND NICHOLAS BUT LITTLE MISS LA CREEVY WHO WAS MOST PARTICULARLY MENTIONED
3347-134425-0003 NOW MY DEARS SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY WHEN THEY HAD RENDERED BECOMING HONOUR TO THE BIDDING AND TIM HAD TAKEN HIS DEPARTURE WHAT DOES THIS MEAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN MOTHER ASKED NICHOLAS SMILING
3347-134425-0004 I SAY MY DEAR REJOINED THAT LADY WITH A FACE OF UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY WHAT DOES THIS INVITATION TO DINNER MEAN WHAT IS ITS INTENTION AND OBJECT I CONCLUDE IT MEANS
3347-134425-0005 THAT ON SUCH A DAY WE ARE TO EAT AND DRINK IN THEIR HOUSE AND THAT ITS INTENT AND OBJECT IS TO CONFER PLEASURE UPON US SAID NICHOLAS AND THAT'S ALL YOU CONCLUDE IT IS MY DEAR I HAVE NOT YET ARRIVED AT ANYTHING DEEPER MOTHER
3347-134425-0006 THEN I'LL JUST TELL YOU ONE THING SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF A LITTLE SURPRISED THAT'S ALL YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT THAT THIS MEANS SOMETHING BESIDES DINNER TEA AND SUPPER PERHAPS SUGGESTED NICHOLAS
3347-134425-0007 I WOULDN'T BE ABSURD MY DEAR IF I WERE YOU REPLIED MISSUS NICKLEBY IN A LOFTY MANNER BECAUSE IT'S NOT BY ANY MEANS BECOMING AND DOESN'T SUIT YOU AT ALL
3347-134425-0008 THAT THE MISTER CHEERYBLES DON'T ASK US TO DINNER WITH ALL THIS CEREMONY FOR NOTHING NEVER MIND WAIT AND SEE YOU WON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING I SAY OF COURSE IT'S MUCH BETTER TO WAIT A GREAT DEAL BETTER IT'S SATISFACTORY TO ALL PARTIES
3347-134425-0009 AND THERE CAN BE NO DISPUTING ALL I SAY IS REMEMBER WHAT I SAY NOW AND WHEN I SAY I SAID SO DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WITH THIS STIPULATION MISSUS NICKLEBY WHO WAS TROUBLED NIGHT AND DAY
3347-134425-0010 WITH A VISION OF A HOT MESSENGER TEARING UP TO THE DOOR TO ANNOUNCE THAT NICHOLAS HAD BEEN TAKEN INTO PARTNERSHIP QUITTED THAT BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT AND ENTERED UPON A NEW ONE IT'S A VERY EXTRAORDINARY THING SHE SAID A MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING
3347-134425-0011 THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE INVITED MISS LA CREEVY IT QUITE ASTONISHES ME UPON MY WORD IT DOES OF COURSE IT'S VERY PLEASANT THAT SHE SHOULD BE INVITED VERY PLEASANT AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE'LL CONDUCT HERSELF EXTREMELY WELL SHE ALWAYS DOES
3347-134425-0012 IT'S VERY GRATIFYING TO THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE MEANS OF INTRODUCING HER INTO SUCH SOCIETY AND I'M QUITE GLAD OF IT QUITE REJOICED FOR SHE CERTAINLY IS AN EXCEEDINGLY WELL BEHAVED AND GOOD NATURED LITTLE PERSON
3347-134425-0013 I COULD WISH THAT SOME FRIEND WOULD MENTION TO HER HOW VERY BADLY SHE HAS HER CAP TRIMMED AND WHAT VERY PREPOSTEROUS BOWS THOSE ARE BUT OF COURSE THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND IF SHE LIKES TO MAKE A FRIGHT OF HERSELF
3347-134425-0014 NO DOUBT SHE HAS A PERFECT RIGHT TO DO SO WE NEVER SEE OURSELVES NEVER DO AND NEVER DID AND I SUPPOSE WE NEVER SHALL THIS MORAL REFLECTION REMINDING HER OF THE NECESSITY OF BEING PECULIARLY SMART ON THE OCCASION
3347-134425-0015 SO AS TO COUNTERBALANCE MISS LA CREEVY AND BE HERSELF AN EFFECTUAL SET OFF AND ATONEMENT LED MISSUS NICKLEBY INTO A CONSULTATION WITH HER DAUGHTER RELATIVE TO CERTAIN RIBBONS GLOVES AND TRIMMINGS WHICH BEING A COMPLICATED QUESTION AND ONE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE
3347-134425-0016 SOON ROUTED THE PREVIOUS ONE AND PUT IT TO FLIGHT THE GREAT DAY ARRIVING THE GOOD LADY PUT HERSELF UNDER KATE'S HANDS AN HOUR OR SO AFTER BREAKFAST AND DRESSING BY EASY STAGES COMPLETED HER TOILETTE IN SUFFICIENT TIME TO ALLOW OF HER DAUGHTER'S MAKING HERS

3347-134425-0018 WHICH A GENTLEMAN HAD SAT UPON COMING DOWN AND WHICH WAS OBLIGED TO BE IRONED AGAIN BEFORE IT WAS FIT FOR SERVICE AT LAST EVERYBODY WAS DRESSED INCLUDING NICHOLAS WHO HAD COME HOME TO FETCH THEM AND THEY WENT AWAY IN A COACH SENT BY THE BROTHERS FOR THE PURPOSE

3347-134425-0020 WITH REMINISCENCES OF DINNERS TO WHICH SHE HAD GONE SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO CONCERNING WHICH SHE PARTICULARISED NOT ONLY THE DISHES BUT THE GUESTS IN WHOM HER HEARERS DID NOT FEEL A VERY ABSORBING INTEREST
3347-134425-0021 AS NOT ONE OF THEM HAD EVER CHANCED TO HEAR THEIR NAMES BEFORE THE OLD BUTLER RECEIVED THEM WITH PROFOUND RESPECT AND MANY SMILES AND USHERED THEM INTO THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE THEY WERE RECEIVED BY THE BROTHERS WITH SO MUCH CORDIALITY AND KINDNESS
3347-134425-0022 THAT MISSUS NICKLEBY WAS QUITE IN A FLUTTER AND HAD SCARCELY PRESENCE OF MIND ENOUGH EVEN TO PATRONISE MISS LA CREEVY KATE WAS STILL MORE AFFECTED BY THE RECEPTION FOR KNOWING THAT THE BROTHERS WERE ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HER AND FRANK
3347-134425-0023 SHE FELT HER POSITION A MOST DELICATE AND TRYING ONE AND WAS TREMBLING ON THE ARM OF NICHOLAS WHEN MISTER CHARLES TOOK HER IN HIS AND LED HER TO ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM HAVE YOU SEEN MADELINE MY DEAR HE SAID SINCE SHE LEFT YOUR HOUSE

3347-134425-0031 THE OLD GENTLEMAN THOUGHT THAT TWO HANDSOMER OR FINER YOUNG FELLOWS COULD SCARCELY STAND SIDE BY SIDE THAN THOSE ON WHOM HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE SUFFERING HIS EYES TO REST UPON THEM FOR A SHORT TIME IN SILENCE
3347-134425-0032 HE SAID WHILE HE SEATED HIMSELF AT HIS DESK I WISH TO SEE YOU FRIENDS CLOSE AND FIRM FRIENDS AND IF I THOUGHT YOU OTHERWISE I SHOULD HESITATE IN WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY FRANK LOOK HERE MISTER NICKLEBY WILL YOU COME ON THE OTHER SIDE

3347-134425-0034 PAYABLE EITHER UPON HER COMING OF AGE OR MARRYING IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THIS GENTLEMAN ANGRY WITH HER HIS ONLY RELATION BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT PUT HERSELF UNDER HIS PROTECTION AND DETACH HERSELF FROM THE SOCIETY OF HER FATHER IN COMPLIANCE WITH HIS REPEATED OVERTURES

3686-171133-0001 ON THE VERY SAME DAY AND HOUR WHEN THE SOLDIERS WERE SLAIN WHICH ONE WOULD THINK MUST HAVE COME TO PASS BY THE DIRECTION OF PROVIDENCE INSOMUCH THAT IN ONE HOUR'S TIME ABOVE TWENTY THOUSAND JEWS WERE KILLED
3686-171133-0003 SO THEY DIVIDED THEMSELVES INTO SEVERAL PARTIES AND LAID WASTE THE VILLAGES OF THE SYRIANS AND THEIR NEIGHBORING CITIES PHILADELPHIA AND SEBONITIS AND GERASA AND PELLA
3686-171133-0004 AND FALLING UPON GAULONITIS SOME CITIES THEY DESTROYED THERE AND SOME THEY SET ON FIRE AND THEN WENT TO KEDASA BELONGING TO THE TYRIANS
3686-171133-0005 TWO HOWEVER THE SYRIANS WERE EVEN WITH THE JEWS IN THE MULTITUDE OF THE MEN WHOM THEY SLEW FOR THEY KILLED THOSE WHOM THEY CAUGHT IN THEIR CITIES AND THAT NOT ONLY OUT OF THE HATRED THEY BARE THEM AS FORMERLY
3686-171133-0006 BUT TO PREVENT THE DANGER UNDER WHICH THEY WERE FROM THEM SO THAT THE DISORDERS IN ALL SYRIA WERE TERRIBLE AND EVERY CITY WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO ARMIES
3686-171133-0007 AND THE PRESERVATION OF THE ONE PARTY WAS IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OTHER SO THE DAY TIME WAS SPENT IN SHEDDING OF BLOOD AND THE NIGHT IN FEAR WHICH WAS OF THE TWO THE MORE TERRIBLE FOR WHEN THE SYRIANS THOUGHT THEY HAD RUINED THE JEWS
3686-171133-0008 THEY HAD THE JUDAIZERS IN SUSPICION ALSO AND AS EACH SIDE DID NOT CARE TO SLAY THOSE WHOM THEY ONLY SUSPECTED ON THE OTHER SO DID THEY GREATLY FEAR THEM WHEN THEY WERE MINGLED WITH THE OTHER AS IF THEY WERE CERTAINLY FOREIGNERS
3686-171133-0009 MOREOVER GREEDINESS OF GAIN WAS A PROVOCATION TO KILL THE OPPOSITE PARTY EVEN TO SUCH AS HAD OF OLD APPEARED VERY MILD AND GENTLE TOWARDS THEM FOR THEY WITHOUT FEAR PLUNDERED THE EFFECTS OF THE SLAIN
3686-171133-0010 IT WAS THEN COMMON TO SEE CITIES FILLED WITH DEAD BODIES STILL LYING UNBURIED AND THOSE OF OLD MEN MIXED WITH INFANTS ALL DEAD AND SCATTERED ABOUT TOGETHER
3686-171133-0011 YOU MIGHT THEN SEE THE WHOLE PROVINCE FULL OF INEXPRESSIBLE CALAMITIES WHILE THE DREAD OF STILL MORE BARBAROUS PRACTICES WHICH WERE THREATENED
3686-171133-0012 THREE AND THUS FAR THE CONFLICT HAD BEEN BETWEEN JEWS AND FOREIGNERS BUT WHEN THEY MADE EXCURSIONS TO SCYTHOPOLIS
3686-171133-0013 FOR AS THEY STOOD IN BATTLE ARRAY WITH THOSE OF SCYTHOPOLIS AND PREFERRED THEIR OWN SAFETY BEFORE THEIR RELATION TO US THEY FOUGHT AGAINST THEIR OWN COUNTRYMEN NAY THEIR ALACRITY WAS SO VERY GREAT THAT THOSE OF SCYTHOPOLIS SUSPECTED THEM
3686-171133-0014 THESE WERE AFRAID THEREFORE LEST THEY SHOULD MAKE AN ASSAULT UPON THE CITY IN THE NIGHT TIME AND TO THEIR GREAT MISFORTUNE SHOULD THEREBY MAKE AN APOLOGY FOR THEMSELVES TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE FOR THEIR REVOLT FROM THEM
3686-171133-0015 SO THEY COMMANDED THEM THAT IN CASE THEY WOULD CONFIRM THEIR AGREEMENT AND DEMONSTRATE THEIR FIDELITY TO THEM WHO WERE OF A DIFFERENT NATION THEY SHOULD GO OUT OF THE CITY WITH THEIR FAMILIES TO A NEIGHBORING GROVE
3686-171133-0016 AND WHEN THEY HAD DONE AS THEY WERE COMMANDED WITHOUT SUSPECTING ANY THING THE PEOPLE OF SCYTHOPOLIS LAY STILL FOR THE INTERVAL OF TWO DAYS TO TEMPT THEM TO BE SECURE BUT ON THE THIRD NIGHT THEY WATCHED THEIR OPPORTUNITY AND CUT ALL THEIR THROATS
3686-171133-0017 SOME AS THEY LAY UNGUARDED AND SOME AS THEY LAY ASLEEP THE NUMBER THAT WAS SLAIN WAS ABOVE THIRTEEN THOUSAND
3686-171133-0018 FOUR IT WILL DESERVE OUR RELATION WHAT BEFELL SIMON HE WAS THE SON OF ONE SAUL A MAN OF REPUTATION AMONG THE JEWS THIS MAN WAS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE REST BY THE STRENGTH OF HIS BODY AND THE BOLDNESS OF HIS CONDUCT
3686-171133-0019 ALTHOUGH HE ABUSED THEM BOTH TO THE MISCHIEVING OF HIS COUNTRYMEN
3686-171133-0020 AND HE FREQUENTLY PUT THEM TO FLIGHT AND BECAME HIMSELF ALONE THE CAUSE OF HIS ARMY'S CONQUERING BUT A JUST PUNISHMENT OVERTOOK HIM FOR THE MURDERS HE HAD COMMITTED UPON THOSE OF THE SAME NATION WITH HIM FOR WHEN THE PEOPLE OF SCYTHOPOLIS THREW THEIR DARTS AT THEM IN THE GROVE
3686-171133-0021 FOR HE SAW THAT HE COULD DO NOTHING AGAINST SUCH A MULTITUDE BUT HE CRIED OUT AFTER A VERY MOVING MANNER AND SAID O YOU PEOPLE OF SCYTHOPOLIS I DESERVEDLY SUFFER FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH RELATION TO YOU WHEN I GAVE YOU SUCH SECURITY OF MY FIDELITY TO YOU
3686-171133-0022 BY SLAYING SO MANY OF THOSE THAT WERE RELATED TO ME WHEREFORE WE VERY JUSTLY EXPERIENCE THE PERFIDIOUSNESS OF FOREIGNERS WHILE WE ACTED AFTER A MOST WICKED MANNER AGAINST OUR OWN NATION
3686-171133-0023 AND LET THE SAME ACTION BE TO ME BOTH A PUNISHMENT FOR MY GREAT CRIMES AND A TESTIMONY OF MY COURAGE TO MY COMMENDATION THAT SO NO ONE OF OUR ENEMIES MAY HAVE IT TO BRAG OF THAT HE IT WAS THAT SLEW ME
3686-171133-0024 AND NO ONE MAY INSULT UPON ME AS I FALL NOW WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS HE LOOKED ROUND ABOUT HIM UPON HIS FAMILY WITH EYES OF COMMISERATION AND OF RAGE THAT FAMILY CONSISTED OF A WIFE AND CHILDREN AND HIS AGED PARENTS
3686-171133-0025 SO IN THE FIRST PLACE HE CAUGHT HIS FATHER BY HIS GREY HAIRS AND RAN HIS SWORD THROUGH HIM AND AFTER HIM HE DID THE SAME TO HIS MOTHER WHO WILLINGLY RECEIVED IT AND AFTER THEM HE DID THE LIKE TO HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN
3686-171133-0026 EVERY ONE ALMOST OFFERING THEMSELVES TO HIS SWORD AS DESIROUS TO PREVENT BEING SLAIN BY THEIR ENEMIES SO WHEN HE HAD GONE OVER ALL HIS FAMILY HE STOOD UPON THEIR BODIES TO BE SEEN BY ALL AND STRETCHING OUT HIS RIGHT HAND
3686-171133-0027 THAT HIS ACTION MIGHT BE OBSERVED BY ALL HE SHEATHED HIS ENTIRE SWORD INTO HIS OWN BOWELS THIS YOUNG MAN WAS TO BE PITIED ON ACCOUNT OF THE STRENGTH OF HIS BODY AND THE COURAGE OF HIS SOUL BUT SINCE HE HAD ASSURED FOREIGNERS OF HIS FIDELITY
3686-171133-0028 AGAINST HIS OWN COUNTRYMEN HE SUFFERED DESERVEDLY FIVE BESIDES THIS MURDER AT SCYTHOPOLIS THE OTHER CITIES ROSE UP AGAINST THE JEWS THAT WERE AMONG THEM THOSE OF ASKELON SLEW TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED
3686-171133-0029 AND THOSE OF PTOLEMAIS TWO THOUSAND AND PUT NOT A FEW INTO BONDS THOSE OF TYRE ALSO PUT A GREAT NUMBER TO DEATH BUT KEPT A GREATER NUMBER IN PRISON
3686-171133-0030 AND APAMIANS SPARED THOSE THAT DWELT WITH THEM AND WOULD NOT ENDURE EITHER TO KILL ANY OF THE JEWS OR TO PUT THEM IN BONDS
3686-171133-0031 THEY DID NO HARM TO THOSE THAT ABODE WITH THEM AND FOR THOSE WHO HAD A MIND TO GO AWAY THEY CONDUCTED THEM AS FAR AS THEIR BORDERS REACHED SIX THERE WAS ALSO A PLOT LAID AGAINST THE JEWS IN AGRIPPA'S KINGDOM
3686-171133-0032 TO ANTIOCH BUT HAD LEFT ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS WHOSE NAME WAS NOARUS TO TAKE CARE OF THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS WHICH NOARUS WAS OF KIN TO KING SOHEMUS
3686-171133-0033 THESE DESIRED TO HAVE AN ARMY PUT INTO THEIR HANDS THAT IF ANY TUMULT SHOULD HAPPEN THEY MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THEM A GUARD SUFFICIENT TO RESTRAIN SUCH AS MIGHT RISE UP AGAINST THEM THIS NOARUS SENT OUT SOME OF THE KING'S ARMED MEN BY NIGHT
3686-171133-0034 AND SLEW ALL THOSE SEVENTY MEN WHICH BOLD ACTION HE VENTURED UPON WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF AGRIPPA AND WAS SUCH A LOVER OF MONEY THAT HE CHOSE TO BE SO WICKED TO HIS OWN COUNTRYMEN THOUGH HE BROUGHT RUIN ON THE KINGDOM THEREBY
3686-171133-0035 AND THUS CRUELLY DID HE TREAT THAT NATION AND THIS CONTRARY TO THE LAWS ALSO UNTIL AGRIPPA WAS INFORMED OF IT WHO DID NOT INDEED DARE TO PUT HIM TO DEATH OUT OF REGARD TO SOHEMUS BUT STILL HE PUT AN END TO HIS PROCURATORSHIP IMMEDIATELY
3686-171133-0036 PERSUADED THE ROMANS WHO WERE IN GARRISON TO LEAVE THE PLACE AND DELIVER IT UP TO THEM THESE ROMANS BEING IN GREAT FEAR LEST THE PLACE SHOULD BE TAKEN BY FORCE MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH THEM TO DEPART UPON CERTAIN CONDITIONS
3686-171133-0037 AND WHEN THEY HAD OBTAINED THE SECURITY THEY DESIRED THEY DELIVERED UP THE CITADEL INTO WHICH THE PEOPLE OF MACHAERUS PUT A GARRISON FOR THEIR OWN SECURITY AND HELD IT IN THEIR OWN POWER SEVEN BUT FOR ALEXANDRIA
3686-171133-0038 THE SEDITION OF THE PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AGAINST THE JEWS WAS PERPETUAL AND THIS FROM THAT VERY TIME WHEN ALEXANDER THE GREAT UPON FINDING THE READINESS OF THE JEWS IN ASSISTING HIM AGAINST THE EGYPTIANS
3686-171133-0039 GAVE THEM EQUAL PRIVILEGES IN THIS CITY WITH THE GRECIANS THEMSELVES WHICH HONORARY REWARD CONTINUED AMONG THEM UNDER HIS SUCCESSORS WHO ALSO SET APART FOR THEM A PARTICULAR PLACE THAT THEY MIGHT LIVE WITHOUT BEING POLLUTED BY THE GENTILES
3686-171133-0040 THEY ALSO GAVE THEM THIS FURTHER PRIVILEGE THAT THEY SHOULD BE CALLED MACEDONIANS NAY WHEN THE ROMANS GOT POSSESSION OF EGYPT NEITHER THE FIRST CAESAR NOR ANY ONE THAT CAME AFTER HIM
3686-171133-0041 THOUGHT OF DIMINISHING THE HONORS WHICH ALEXANDER HAD BESTOWED ON THE JEWS BUT STILL CONFLICTS PERPETUALLY AROSE WITH THE GRECIANS AND ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNORS DID EVERY DAY PUNISH MANY OF THEM YET DID THE SEDITION GROW WORSE BUT AT THIS TIME ESPECIALLY
3686-171133-0042 A GREAT NUMBER OF JEWS CAME FLOCKING TO THE THEATER BUT WHEN THEIR ADVERSARIES SAW THEM THEY IMMEDIATELY CRIED OUT AND CALLED THEM THEIR ENEMIES AND SAID THEY CAME AS SPIES UPON THEM UPON WHICH THEY RUSHED OUT AND LAID VIOLENT HANDS UPON THEM
3686-171133-0043 AND AS FOR THE REST THEY WERE SLAIN AS THEY RAN AWAY BUT THERE WERE THREE MEN WHOM THEY CAUGHT AND HAULED THEM ALONG IN ORDER TO HAVE THEM BURNT ALIVE BUT ALL THE JEWS CAME IN A BODY TO DEFEND THEM WHO AT FIRST THREW STONES AT THE GRECIANS
3686-171133-0044 BUT AFTER THAT THEY TOOK LAMPS AND RUSHED WITH VIOLENCE INTO THE THEATER AND THREATENED THAT THEY WOULD BURN THE PEOPLE TO A MAN AND THIS THEY HAD SOON DONE UNLESS TIBERIUS ALEXANDER THE GOVERNOR OF THE CITY HAD RESTRAINED THEIR PASSIONS
3686-171133-0045 HOWEVER THIS MAN DID NOT BEGIN TO TEACH THEM WISDOM BY ARMS BUT SENT AMONG THEM PRIVATELY SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL MEN AND THEREBY ENTREATED THEM TO BE QUIET AND NOT PROVOKE THE ROMAN ARMY AGAINST THEM
3686-171133-0046 BUT THE SEDITIOUS MADE A JEST OF THE ENTREATIES OF TIBERIUS AND REPROACHED HIM FOR SO DOING EIGHT NOW WHEN HE PERCEIVED THAT THOSE WHO WERE FOR INNOVATIONS WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED TILL SOME GREAT CALAMITY SHOULD OVERTAKE THEM
3686-171133-0047 HE SENT OUT UPON THEM THOSE TWO ROMAN LEGIONS THAT WERE IN THE CITY AND TOGETHER WITH THEM FIVE THOUSAND OTHER SOLDIERS WHO BY CHANCE WERE COME TOGETHER OUT OF LIBYA TO THE RUIN OF THE JEWS
3686-171133-0048 THEY WERE ALSO PERMITTED NOT ONLY TO KILL THEM BUT TO PLUNDER THEM OF WHAT THEY HAD AND TO SET FIRE TO THEIR HOUSES THESE SOLDIERS RUSHED VIOLENTLY INTO THAT PART OF THE CITY THAT WAS CALLED DELTA WHERE THE JEWISH PEOPLE LIVED TOGETHER AND DID AS THEY WERE BIDDEN
3686-171133-0049 THOUGH NOT WITHOUT BLOODSHED ON THEIR OWN SIDE ALSO FOR THE JEWS GOT TOGETHER AND SET THOSE THAT WERE THE BEST ARMED AMONG THEM IN THE FOREFRONT AND MADE A RESISTANCE FOR A GREAT WHILE BUT WHEN ONCE THEY GAVE BACK THEY WERE DESTROYED UNMERCIFULLY
3686-171133-0050 WHICH HOUSES WERE FIRST PLUNDERED OF WHAT WAS IN THEM AND THEN SET ON FIRE BY THE ROMANS WHEREIN NO MERCY WAS SHOWN TO THE INFANTS AND NO REGARD HAD TO THE AGED
3686-171133-0051 OF EVERY AGE TILL ALL THE PLACE WAS OVERFLOWED WITH BLOOD AND FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM LAY DEAD UPON HEAPS NOR HAD THE REMAINDER BEEN PRESERVED HAD THEY NOT BE TAKEN THEMSELVES TO SUPPLICATION SO ALEXANDER COMMISERATED THEIR CONDITION
3686-171133-0052 AND GAVE ORDERS TO THE ROMANS TO RETIRE ACCORDINGLY THESE BEING ACCUSTOMED TO OBEY ORDERS LEFT OFF KILLING AT THE FIRST INTIMATION BUT THE POPULACE OF ALEXANDRIA BARE SO VERY GREAT HATRED TO THE JEWS
3686-171133-0053 AND IT WAS A HARD THING TO MAKE THEM LEAVE THEIR DEAD BODIES NINE AND THIS WAS THE MISERABLE CALAMITY WHICH AT THIS TIME BEFELL THE JEWS AT ALEXANDRIA
3686-171133-0054 WHILE THE JEWS WERE EVERYWHERE UP IN ARMS SO HE TOOK OUT OF ANTIOCH THE TWELFTH LEGION ENTIRE AND OUT OF EACH OF THE REST HE SELECTED TWO THOUSAND WITH SIX COHORTS OF FOOTMEN AND FOUR TROOPS OF HORSEMEN
3686-171133-0055 BESIDES THOSE AUXILIARIES WHICH WERE SENT BY THE KINGS
3686-171133-0056 AND THREE THOUSAND FOOTMEN WITH AS MANY ARCHERS AND AGRIPPA SENT THE SAME NUMBER OF FOOTMEN AND ONE THOUSAND HORSEMEN SOHEMUS ALSO FOLLOWED WITH FOUR THOUSAND A THIRD PART WHEREOF WERE HORSEMEN BUT MOST PART WERE ARCHERS
3686-171133-0057 AND THUS DID HE MARCH TO PTOLEMAIS
3686-171133-0058 WHO INDEED HAD NOT THE SAME SKILL IN MARTIAL AFFAIRS BUT MADE UP IN THEIR ALACRITY AND IN THEIR HATRED TO THE JEWS WHAT THEY WANTED IN SKILL THERE CAME ALSO ALONG WITH CESTIUS AGRIPPA HIMSELF BOTH AS A GUIDE IN HIS MARCH OVER THE COUNTRY
3686-171133-0059 AND A DIRECTOR WHAT WAS FIT TO BE DONE
3686-171133-0060 AND MARCHED HASTILY TO ZABULON A STRONG CITY OF GALILEE WHICH WAS CALLED THE CITY OF MEN AND DIVIDES THE COUNTRY OF PTOLEMAIS FROM OUR NATION THIS HE FOUND DESERTED BY ITS MEN THE MULTITUDE HAVING FLED TO THE MOUNTAINS
3686-171133-0061 BUT FULL OF ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS THOSE HE GAVE LEAVE TO THE SOLDIERS TO PLUNDER AND SET FIRE TO THE CITY ALTHOUGH IT WAS OF ADMIRABLE BEAUTY AND HAD ITS HOUSES BUILT LIKE THOSE IN TYRE AND SIDON AND BERYTUS
3686-171133-0062 AFTER THIS HE OVERRAN ALL THE COUNTRY AND SEIZED UPON WHATSOEVER CAME IN HIS WAY AND SET FIRE TO THE VILLAGES THAT WERE ROUND ABOUT THEM AND THEN RETURNED TO PTOLEMAIS BUT WHEN THE SYRIANS AND ESPECIALLY THOSE OF BERYTUS WERE BUSY IN PLUNDERING
3686-171133-0063 AND FELL UPON THOSE THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND UNEXPECTEDLY AND DESTROYED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND OF THEM
3686-171133-0064 AND GAVE ORDER THAT IF THEY COULD TAKE THAT CITY BY SURPRISE THEY SHOULD KEEP IT BUT THAT IN CASE THE CITIZENS SHOULD PERCEIVE THEY WERE COMING TO ATTACK THEM
3686-171133-0065 THAT THEY THEN SHOULD STAY FOR HIM AND FOR THE REST OF THE ARMY SO SOME OF THEM MADE A BRISK MARCH BY THE SEA SIDE AND SOME BY LAND AND SO COMING UPON THEM ON BOTH SIDES THEY TOOK THE CITY WITH EASE AND AS THE INHABITANTS
3686-171133-0066 NOR HAD GOTTEN ANY THING READY FOR FIGHTING THE SOLDIERS FELL UPON THEM AND SLEW THEM ALL WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND THEN PLUNDERED AND BURNT THE CITY THE NUMBER OF THE SLAIN WAS EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED IN LIKE MANNER
3686-171133-0067 TO THE TOPARCHY OF NARBATENE
3686-171133-0068 WHO DESTROYED THE COUNTRY AND SLEW A GREAT MULTITUDE OF ITS PEOPLE
3686-171133-0069 THE COMMANDER OF THE TWELFTH LEGION INTO GALILEE AND DELIVERED TO HIM AS MANY OF HIS FORCES AS HE SUPPOSED SUFFICIENT TO SUBDUE THAT NATION HE WAS RECEIVED BY THE STRONGEST CITY OF GALILEE WHICH WAS SEPPHORIS WITH ACCLAMATIONS OF JOY
3686-171133-0070 WHICH WISE CONDUCT OF THAT CITY OCCASIONED THE REST OF THE CITIES TO BE IN QUIET WHILE THE SEDITIOUS PART AND THE ROBBERS RAN AWAY TO THAT MOUNTAIN WHICH LIES IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF GALILEE AND IS SITUATED OVER AGAINST SEPPHORIS IT IS CALLED ASAMON
3686-171133-0071 SO GALLUS BROUGHT HIS FORCES AGAINST THEM BUT WHILE THOSE MEN WERE IN THE SUPERIOR PARTS ABOVE THE ROMANS THEY EASILY THREW THEIR DARTS UPON THE ROMANS AS THEY MADE THEIR APPROACHES AND SLEW ABOUT TWO HUNDRED OF THEM BUT WHEN THE ROMANS HAD GONE ROUND THE MOUNTAINS
3686-171133-0072 AND WERE GOTTEN INTO THE PARTS ABOVE THEIR ENEMIES THE OTHERS WERE SOON BEATEN NOR COULD THEY WHO HAD ONLY LIGHT ARMOR ON SUSTAIN THE FORCE OF THEM THAT FOUGHT THEM ARMED ALL OVER NOR WHEN THEY WERE BEATEN COULD THEY ESCAPE THE ENEMIES HORSEMEN
3686-171133-0073 AMONG THE MOUNTAINS WHILE THE REST
3686-171134-0000 WHAT CESTIUS DID AGAINST THE JEWS AND HOW UPON HIS BESIEGING JERUSALEM HE RETREATED FROM THE CITY WITHOUT ANY JUST OCCASION IN THE WORLD AS ALSO WHAT SEVERE CALAMITIES HE UNDER WENT FROM THE JEWS IN HIS RETREAT
3686-171134-0001 ONE AND NOW GALLUS SEEING NOTHING MORE THAT LOOKED TOWARDS AN INNOVATION IN GALILEE
3686-171134-0002 SO THEY CAME AND FINDING THEIR CAMP DESERTED THEY BURNT IT AS WELL AS THE VILLAGES THAT LAY ABOUT IT
3686-171134-0003 HE FOUND THE CITY EMPTY OF ITS MEN
3686-171134-0004 AND SO MARCHED FORWARDS AND ASCENDING BY BETBORON
3686-171134-0005 FIFTY FURLONGS DISTANT FROM JERUSALEM TWO BUT AS FOR THE JEWS WHEN THEY SAW THE WAR APPROACHING TO THEIR METROPOLIS THEY LEFT THE FEAST AND BETOOK THEMSELVES TO THEIR ARMS
3686-171134-0006 AND TAKING COURAGE GREATLY FROM THEIR MULTITUDE WENT IN A SUDDEN AND DISORDERLY MANNER TO THE FIGHT WITH A GREAT NOISE AND WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION HAD OF THE REST OF THE SEVENTH DAY
3686-171134-0007 WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THEREFORE DID THEY FALL UPON THE ROMANS AS TO BREAK INTO THEIR RANKS AND TO MARCH THROUGH THE MIDST OF THEM MAKING A GREAT SLAUGHTER AS THEY WENT INSOMUCH THAT UNLESS THE HORSEMEN AND SUCH PART OF THE FOOTMEN
3686-171134-0008 AS WERE NOT YET TIRED IN THE ACTION HAD WHEELED ROUND AND SUCCORED THAT PART OF THE ARMY WHICH WAS NOT YET BROKEN
3686-171134-0009 HOWEVER FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN OF THE ROMANS WERE SLAIN OF WHICH NUMBER FOUR HUNDRED WERE FOOTMEN AND THE REST HORSEMEN WHILE THE JEWS LOST ONLY TWENTY TWO OF WHOM THE MOST VALIANT WERE THE KINSMEN OF MONOBAZUS
3686-171134-0010 WHEN THE FRONT OF THE JEWISH ARMY HAD BEEN CUT OFF THE JEWS RETIRED INTO THE CITY BUT STILL SIMON THE SON OF GIORA FELL UPON THE BACKS OF THE ROMANS AS THEY WERE ASCENDING UP BETHORON
3686-171134-0011 AND PUT THE HINDMOST OF THE ARMY INTO DISORDER AND CARRIED OFF MANY OF THE BEASTS THAT CARRIED THE WEAPONS OF WAR AND LED SHEM INTO THE CITY BUT AS CESTIUS TARRIED THERE THREE DAYS THE JEWS SEIZED UPON THE ELEVATED PARTS OF THE CITY
3686-171134-0012 AND SET WATCHES AT THE ENTRANCES INTO THE CITY AND APPEARED OPENLY RESOLVED NOT TO REST WHEN ONCE THE ROMANS SHOULD BEGIN TO MARCH THREE AND NOW WHEN AGRIPPA OBSERVED
3686-171134-0013 THAT EVEN THE AFFAIRS OF THE ROMANS WERE LIKELY TO BE IN DANGER WHILE SUCH AN IMMENSE MULTITUDE OF THEIR ENEMIES HAD SEIZED UPON THE MOUNTAINS ROUND ABOUT HE DETERMINED TO TRY WHAT THE JEWS WOULD AGREE TO BY WORDS
3686-171134-0014 AS THINKING THAT HE SHOULD EITHER PERSUADE THEM ALL TO DESIST FROM FIGHTING OR HOWEVER THAT HE SHOULD CAUSE THE SOBER PART OF THEM TO SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM THE OPPOSITE PARTY
3686-171134-0015 TO SECURE THEM OF THE ROMANS ENTIRE FORGIVENESS OF WHAT THEY HAD DONE AMISS
3686-171134-0016 ACCORDINGLY THEY SLEW PHEBUS BEFORE HE SAID A WORD BUT BORCEUS WAS ONLY WOUNDED AND SO PREVENTED HIS FATE BY FLYING AWAY AND WHEN THE PEOPLE WERE VERY ANGRY AT THIS THEY HAD THE SEDITIOUS BEATEN WITH STONES AND CLUBS
3686-171134-0017 AFFORDED HIM A PROPER OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK THEM TOOK HIS WHOLE ARMY ALONG WITH HIM AND PUT THE JEWS TO FLIGHT AND PURSUED THEM TO JERUSALEM HE THEN PITCHED HIS CAMP UPON THE ELEVATION CALLED SCOPUS OR WATCH TOWER
3686-171134-0018 WHICH WAS DISTANT SEVEN FURLONGS FROM THE CITY
3686-171134-0019 OUT OF EXPECTATION THAT THOSE WITHIN MIGHT PERHAPS YIELD A LITTLE
3686-171134-0020 TO SEIZE UPON THEIR CORN AND ON THE FOURTH DAY
3686-171134-0021 HE BROUGHT IT INTO THE CITY NOW FOR THE PEOPLE THEY WERE KEPT UNDER BY THE SEDITIOUS BUT THE SEDITIOUS THEMSELVES WERE GREATLY AFFRIGHTED AT THE GOOD ORDER OF THE ROMANS AND RETIRED FROM THE SUBURBS AND RETREATED INTO THE INNER PART OF THE CITY AND INTO THE TEMPLE
3686-171134-0022 HE SET THE PART CALLED BEZETHA
3686-171134-0023 OR THE NEW CITY ON FIRE AS HE DID ALSO TO THE TIMBER MARKET AFTER WHICH HE CAME INTO THE UPPER CITY AND PITCHED HIS CAMP OVER AGAINST THE ROYAL PALACE AND HAD HE BUT AT THIS VERY TIME ATTEMPTED TO GET WITHIN THE WALLS BY FORCE
3686-171134-0024 HE HAD WON THE CITY PRESENTLY AND THE WAR HAD BEEN PUT AN END TO AT ONCE
3686-171134-0025 AND A GREAT NUMBER OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HORSE HAD BEEN CORRUPTED BY FLORUS
3686-171134-0026 AND THAT WAS THE OCCASION THAT THIS WAR LASTED SO VERY LONG AND THEREBY THE JEWS WERE INVOLVED IN SUCH INCURABLE CALAMITIES FIVE
3686-171134-0027 AND WERE ABOUT TO OPEN THE GATES FOR HIM BUT HE OVERLOOKED THIS OFFER PARTLY OUT OF HIS ANGER AT THE JEWS AND PARTLY BECAUSE HE DID NOT THOROUGHLY BELIEVE THEY WERE IN EARNEST
3686-171134-0028 WHENCE IT WAS THAT HE DELAYED THE MATTER SO LONG THAT THE SEDITIOUS PERCEIVED THE TREACHERY AND THREW ANANUS AND THOSE OF HIS PARTY DOWN FROM THE WALL AND PELTING THEM WITH STONES DROVE THEM INTO THEIR HOUSES
3686-171134-0029 BUT THEY STOOD THEMSELVES AT PROPER DISTANCES IN THE TOWERS AND THREW THEIR DARTS AT THOSE THAT WERE GETTING OVER THE WALL THUS DID THE ROMANS MAKE THEIR ATTACK AGAINST THE WALL FOR FIVE DAYS BUT TO NO PURPOSE
3686-171134-0030 AND WITH THEM THE ARCHERS AND ATTEMPTED TO BREAK INTO THE TEMPLE AT THE NORTHERN QUARTER OF IT BUT THE JEWS BEAT THEM OFF FROM THE CLOISTERS AND REPULSED THEM SEVERAL TIMES WHEN THEY WERE GOTTEN NEAR TO THE WALL
3686-171134-0031 TILL AT LENGTH THE MULTITUDE OF THE DARTS CUT THEM OFF AND MADE THEM RETIRE BUT THE FIRST RANK OF THE ROMANS RESTED THEIR SHIELDS UPON THE WALL AND SO DID THOSE THAT WERE BEHIND THEM AND THE LIKE DID THOSE THAT WERE STILL MORE BACKWARD
3686-171134-0032 AS THOUGH IT WERE TO BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY BUT THE PEOPLE UPON THIS TOOK COURAGE AND WHERE THE WICKED PART OF THE CITY GAVE GROUND THITHER DID THEY COME IN ORDER TO SET OPEN THE GATES
3686-171134-0033 WHO HAD HE BUT CONTINUED THE SIEGE A LITTLE LONGER HAD CERTAINLY TAKEN THE CITY BUT IT WAS I SUPPOSE OWING TO THE AVERSION GOD HAD ALREADY AT THE CITY AND THE SANCTUARY THAT HE WAS HINDERED FROM PUTTING AN END TO THE WAR THAT VERY DAY
3686-171134-0034 IT THEN HAPPENED THAT CESTIUS WAS NOT CONSCIOUS EITHER HOW THE BESIEGED DESPAIRED OF SUCCESS NOR HOW COURAGEOUS THE PEOPLE WERE FOR HIM AND SO HE RECALLED HIS SOLDIERS FROM THE PLACE
3686-171134-0035 AND BY DESPAIRING OF ANY EXPECTATION OF TAKING IT WITHOUT HAVING RECEIVED ANY DISGRACE HE RETIRED FROM THE CITY WITHOUT ANY REASON IN THE WORLD BUT WHEN THE ROBBERS PERCEIVED THIS UNEXPECTED RETREAT OF HIS THEY RESUMED THEIR COURAGE
3686-171134-0036 AND DESTROYED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF BOTH THEIR HORSEMEN AND FOOTMEN
3686-171134-0037 AND AS HE WENT OFF FARTHER NEXT DAY HE THEREBY INVITED THE ENEMY TO FOLLOW HIM WHO STILL FELL UPON THE HINDMOST AND DESTROYED THEM THEY ALSO FELL UPON THE FLANK ON EACH SIDE OF THE ARMY
3686-171134-0038 AND THREW DARTS UPON THEM OBLIQUELY NOR DURST THOSE THAT WERE HINDMOST TURN BACK UPON THOSE WHO WOUNDED THEM BEHIND AS IMAGINING THAT THE MULTITUDE OF THOSE THAT PURSUED THEM WAS IMMENSE
3686-171134-0039 WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO REVENGE THEMSELVES UPON THEIR ENEMIES SO THEY WERE GALLED ALL THE WAY AND THEIR RANKS WERE PUT INTO DISORDER AND THOSE THAT WERE THUS PUT OUT OF THEIR RANKS WERE SLAIN AMONG WHOM WERE PRISCUS
3686-171134-0040 THE COMMANDER OF THE SIXTH LEGION AND LONGINUS THE TRIBUNE AND EMILIUS SECUNDUS THE COMMANDER OF A TROOP OF HORSEMEN SO IT WAS NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
3686-171134-0041 AND WAS IN GREAT DISTRESS TO KNOW WHAT HE SHOULD DO IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT WHEN ON THE THIRD DAY HE SAW A STILL MUCH GREATER NUMBER OF ENEMIES AND ALL THE PARTS ROUND ABOUT HIM FULL OF JEWS HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HIS DELAY WAS TO HIS OWN DETRIMENT
3686-171134-0042 SO THEY KILLED THE MULES AND OTHER CREATURES EXCEPTING THOSE THAT CARRIED THEIR DARTS AND MACHINES WHICH THEY RETAINED FOR THEIR OWN USE AND THIS PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID LEST THE JEWS SHOULD SEIZE UPON THEM
3686-171134-0043 OVER AGAINST THE NECK OF THE PASSAGE AND COVERED THE ROMAN ARMY WITH THEIR DARTS IN WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES AS THE FOOTMEN KNEW NOT HOW TO DEFEND THEMSELVES SO THE DANGER PRESSED THE HORSEMEN STILL MORE FOR THEY WERE SO PELTED
3686-171134-0044 AND THE ASCENTS WERE SO HIGH THAT THE CAVALRY WERE NOT ABLE TO MARCH AGAINST THE ENEMY THE PRECIPICES ALSO AND VALLEYS INTO WHICH THEY FREQUENTLY FELL AND TUMBLED DOWN WERE SUCH ON EACH SIDE OF THEM
3686-171134-0045 AND TO SUCH MOURNFUL CRIES AS MEN USE IN THE UTMOST DESPAIR THE JOYFUL ACCLAMATIONS OF THE JEWS ALSO AS THEY ENCOURAGED ONE ANOTHER ECHOED THE SOUNDS BACK AGAIN THESE LAST COMPOSING A NOISE OF THOSE
3686-171134-0046 THAT AT ONCE REJOICED AND WERE IN A RAGE INDEED THINGS WERE COME TO SUCH A PASS
3686-171134-0047 HAD NOT THE NIGHT COME ON WHEN THE ROMANS FLED TO BETHORON AND THE JEWS SEIZED UPON ALL THE PLACES ROUND ABOUT THEM AND WATCHED FOR THEIR COMING OUT IN THE MORNING NINE
3686-171134-0048 CONTRIVED HOW HE MIGHT BEST RUN AWAY AND WHEN HE HAD SELECTED FOUR HUNDRED OF THE MOST COURAGEOUS OF HIS SOLDIERS HE PLACED THEM AT THE STRONGEST OF THEIR FORTIFICATIONS AND GAVE ORDER THAT WHEN THEY WENT UP TO THE MORNING GUARD THEY SHOULD ERECT THEIR ENSIGNS
3686-171134-0049 AND MARCHED WITHOUT ANY NOISE THIRTY FURLONGS BUT WHEN THE JEWS PERCEIVED IN THE MORNING THAT THE CAMP WAS EMPTY THEY RAN UPON THOSE FOUR HUNDRED WHO HAD DELUDED THEM AND IMMEDIATELY THREW THEIR DARTS AT THEM AND SLEW THEM
3686-171134-0050 AND THEN PURSUED AFTER CESTIUS BUT HE HAD ALREADY MADE USE OF A GREAT PART OF THE NIGHT IN HIS FLIGHT AND STILL MARCHED QUICKER WHEN IT WAS DAY
3686-171134-0051 AND FOR THROWING OF STONES AND A GREAT PART OF THE INSTRUMENTS OF WAR SO THE JEWS WENT ON PURSUING THE ROMANS AS FAR AS ANTIPATRIS AFTER WHICH SEEING THEY COULD NOT OVERTAKE THEM THEY CAME BACK
3686-171134-0052 AND TOOK THE ENGINES AND SPOILED THE DEAD BODIES AND GATHERED THE PREY TOGETHER WHICH THE ROMANS HAD LEFT BEHIND THEM AND CAME BACK RUNNING AND SINGING TO THEIR METROPOLIS WHILE THEY HAD THEMSELVES LOST A FEW ONLY
3686-171134-0053 BUT HAD SLAIN OF THE ROMANS FIVE THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED FOOTMEN AND THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY HORSEMEN
3703-71531-0000 I SHALL SEND HER AWAY IF SHE DOES NOT IMPROVE THE DUCHESS SAID SHE SHALL GO TO SOME REMOTE PLACE IN THE HIGHLANDS AND SHE SHALL NOT BE ALLOWED TO REMEMBER THAT THERE IS A WAR IN THE WORLD
3703-71531-0001 IF I CAN MANAGE TO SEND HER OLD NURSE DOWIE WITH HER SHE WILL STAND GUARD OVER HER LIKE AN OLD SHEPHERD
3703-71531-0002 BUT SHE DISCOVERED NO REASON COMMON OR UNCOMMON FOR THE THING SHE RECOGNISED EACH TIME SHE LOOKED AT HER IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT SHE SHOULD TALK TO LORD COOMBE BUT SHE MET IN HIM A SORT OF BARRIER
3703-71531-0003 SHE COULD NOT AVOID SEEING THAT HE WAS PREOCCUPIED SHE REMOTELY FELT THAT HE WAS TURNING OVER IN HIS MIND SOMETHING WHICH PRECLUDED THE POSSIBILITY OF HIS GIVING ATTENTION TO OTHER QUESTIONS
3703-71531-0004 I ALMOST FEEL AS IF YOUR INTEREST IN HER HAD LAPSED SHE SAID AT LAST NO IT HAS TAKEN A AN ENTIRELY NEW FORM WAS HIS ANSWER
3703-71531-0006 AS REDCLIFF SAID IN SPEAKING OF HER AND GIRLS GENERALLY ALL THE GATES ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN THE DUCHESS WAS VERY SILENT FOR A SPACE BEFORE SHE MADE HER REPLY YES YOU DO NOT KNOW HER MOTHER NO
3703-71531-0007 TWO WEEKS AGO SHE GAVE ME SOMETHING TO REFLECT ON HER FEELING FOR HER DAUGHTER IS THAT OF A PRETTY CAT LIKE WOMAN FOR SOMETHING ENRAGINGLY YOUNGER THAN HERSELF SHE ALWAYS RESENTED HER SHE WAS INFURIATED BY YOUR INTEREST IN HER
3703-71531-0008 SHE SAID TO ME ONE AFTERNOON I HOPE THE DUCHESS IS STILL PLEASED WITH HER COMPANION I SAW HER TO DAY IN BOND STREET AND SHE LOOKED LIKE A HOUSEMAID I ONCE HAD TO DISMISS RATHER SUDDENLY
3703-71531-0009 AFTER A FEW SECONDS
3703-71531-0010 HE TOLD ME SO HIMSELF AT THE ERWYN'S I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD SEEN HER SINCE THE DANCE AND HE OWNED THAT HE HAD AND THEN WAS CROSS AT HIMSELF FOR MAKING THE SLIP
3703-71531-0011 HE WOULD NOT HAVE TOLD ME BUT IF HE MET HER ONCE HE MET HER AS OFTEN AS HE CHOSE SHE WAS NOT LYING WHEN SHE SAID IT I KNOW HER I HAVE BEEN THINKING CONSTANTLY EVER SINCE THERE WAS A BRIEF SILENCE BETWEEN THEM THEN HE PROCEEDED
3703-71531-0012 ROBIN WORSHIPPED HIM WHEN SHE WAS A MERE BABY THEY WERE VERY BEAUTIFUL TOGETHER ON THE NIGHT OF THE DANCE SHE FAINTED ON THE STAIRWAY AFTER HEARING OF HIS DEATH
3703-71531-0013 POOR CHILD IT IS ONE OF THE TRAGEDIES PERHAPS YOU AND I TOGETHER THE DUCHESS WAS SEEING AGAIN THE TWO WHO HAD COME FORTH SHINING FROM THE CONSERVATORY SHE CONTINUED TO SEE THEM AS LORD COOMBE WENT ON SPEAKING
3703-71531-0014 TELLING HER WHAT DOCTOR REDCLIFF HAD TOLD HIM ON HER PART ROBIN SCARCELY UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING WHICH WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO MATTER
3703-71531-0015 SHE LOOKED AT HER WITH A CURIOUS SORT OF PITIFULNESS AS IF SHE WERE SORRY MY POOR CHILD SHE SAID WHATSOEVER HE TELLS YOU DON'T BE FRIGHTENED DON'T THINK YOU ARE WITHOUT FRIENDS I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU
3703-71531-0016 THANK YOU SHE SAID I DON'T THINK ANYTHING WOULD FRIGHTEN ME NOTHING SEEMS FRIGHTENING NOW AFTER WHICH SHE WENT INTO THE ROOM WHERE DOCTOR REDCLIFF WAS WAITING FOR HER THE DUCHESS SAT ALONE AND THOUGHT DEEPLY
3703-71531-0017 WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF CHIEFLY WAS THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE OF COOMBE SHE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT MORE THAN PROBABLY HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS A CIRCUMSTANCE OF THIS SORT WOULD NOT EVEN REMOTELY APPROACH IN LIKENESS THAT OF OTHER PEOPLE
3703-71531-0018 HIS POINT OF VIEW WOULD DETACH ITSELF FROM ORDINARY THEORIES OF MORALITIES AND IMMORALITIES HE WOULD SEE WITH SINGULAR CLEARNESS ALL SIDES OF THE INCIDENT HE WOULD NOT BE INDIGNANT OR ANNOYED OR EMBARRASSED
3703-71531-0019 HE HAD HAD AN INTEREST IN ROBIN AS A CREATURE REPRESENTING PECULIAR LOVELINESS AND UNDEFENDED POTENTIALITIES SOMETIMES SHE HAD FELT THAT THIS HAD EVEN VERGED ON A TENDERNESS OF WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF
3703-71531-0020 HE HAD BELIEVED FINE THINGS OF HIM AND HAD WATCHED HIM SILENTLY HE HAD WISHED HE HAD BEEN HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD PERHAPS HE HAD ALWAYS FELT A LONGING FOR A SON WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS COMPANION AS WELL AS HIS SUCCESSOR
3703-71531-0021 WHO KNEW WHETHER A THWARTED PATERNAL INSTINCT MIGHT NOT NOW BE GIVING HIM SUCH THINKING TO DO AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE IF DONAL MUIR HAD BEEN THE SON OF HIS BODY DEAD ON THE BATTLEFIELD BUT LEAVING BEHIND HIM SOMETHING TO BE GRAVELY CONSIDERED WHAT WOULD A MAN THINK
3703-71531-0022 WHAT WOULD A MAN DO UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES ONE MIGHT IMAGINE WHAT SOME MEN WOULD DO BUT IT WOULD DEPEND ENTIRELY UPON THE TYPE SHE THOUGHT WHAT HE WILL DO WILL BE DIFFERENT IT MIGHT SEEM COLD
3703-71531-0023 IT MIGHT BE MERELY JUDICIAL BUT IT MIGHT BE SURPRISING SHE WAS QUITE HAUNTED BY THE HAGGARD LOOK OF HIS FACE AS HE HAD EXCLAIMED I WISH TO GOD I HAD KNOWN HIM BETTER I WISH TO GOD I HAD TALKED TO HIM MORE
3703-71531-0024 WHAT HE HAD DONE THIS MORNING WAS TO GO TO MERSHAM WOOD TO SEE MISSUS BENNETT THERE WERE THINGS IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO LEARN BY AMIABLE AND CAREFULLY CONSIDERED EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IN HER LOSS AND LONELINESS
3703-71531-0025 THE TRAGEDY IS UNDERSTANDABLE THE DUCHESS THINKING ENDED PITYINGLY BECAUSE JUST AT THIS TIME IT WAS THAT ROBIN OPENED THE DOOR AND STOOD LOOKING AT HER IT SEEMED AS THOUGH DOCTOR REDCLIFF MUST HAVE TALKED TO HER FOR A LONG TIME
3703-71531-0026 BUT SHE HAD ON HER SMALL HAT AND COAT AND WHAT THE DUCHESS SEEMED CHIEFLY TO SEE WAS THE WIDE DARKNESS OF HER EYES SET IN A FACE SUDDENLY PINCHED SMALL AND SNOW WHITE SHE LOOKED LIKE A STARVED BABY
3703-71531-0027 PLEASE SHE SAID WITH HER HANDS CLASPED AGAINST HER CHEST PLEASE MAY I GO TO MERSHAM WOOD TO MERSHAM WOOD THE DUCHESS FELT AGHAST AND THEN SUDDENLY A FLOOD OF THOUGHT RUSHED UPON HER
3703-71531-0028 IT IS NOT VERY FAR THE LITTLE GASPING VOICE UTTERED I MUST GO PLEASE OH I MUST JUST TO MERSHAM WOOD SOMETHING ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE ROSE IN THE DUCHESS THROAT CHILD SHE SAID
3703-71531-0029 COME HERE ROBIN WENT TO HER OH POOR LITTLE SOUL IN UTTER OBEDIENCE AS SHE DREW CLOSE TO HER SHE WENT DOWN UPON HER KNEES HOLDING UP HER HANDS LIKE A LITTLE NUN AT PRAYER PLEASE LET ME GO SHE SAID AGAIN
3703-71531-0030 STAY HERE MY POOR CHILD AND TALK TO ME THE DUCHESS SAID
3703-71531-0031 WHEN I COME BACK I WILL TRY I I WANT TO ASK THE WOOD
3703-71531-0032 IT IS NOT FAR DOCTOR REDCLIFF SAID I MIGHT GO MISSUS BENNETT IS THERE SHE LOVES ME ARE YOU GOING TO TALK TO MISSUS BENNETT NO NO NO NO NOT TO ANY ONE IN THE WORLD
3703-71531-0033 HAPLESS YOUNG CREATURES IN HER PLIGHT MUST ALWAYS BE TOUCHING BUT HER TOUCHINGNESS WAS INDESCRIBABLE ALMOST UNENDURABLE TO THE RIPE AGED WOMAN OF THE WORLD WHO WATCHED AND HEARD HER
3703-71531-0034 IT WAS AS IF SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE MEANING OF THINGS AS IF SOME LITTLE SPIRIT HAD BEEN TORN FROM HEAVEN AND FLUNG DOWN UPON THE DARK EARTH ONE FELT THAT ONE MUST WEEP ALOUD OVER THE EXQUISITE INCOMPREHENSIBLE REMOTENESS OF HER
3703-71531-0035 AND IT WAS SO AWFULLY PLAIN THAT THERE WAS SOME TRAGIC CONNECTION WITH THE WOOD AND THAT HER WHOLE SOUL CRIED OUT TO IT AND SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK TO ANY ONE IN THE WORLD SUCH THINGS HAD BEEN KNOWN WAS THE CHILD'S BRAIN WAVERING
3703-71531-0036 WHY NOT ALL THE WORLD WAS MAD WAS THE OLDER WOMAN'S THOUGHT AND SHE HERSELF AFTER ALL THE YEARS HAD FOR THIS MOMENT NO SENSE OF BALANCE AND FELT AS IF ALL OLD REASONS FOR THINGS HAD BEEN SWEPT AWAY
3703-71531-0037 IF YOU WILL COME BACK SHE SAID I WILL LET YOU GO AFTER THE POOR CHILD HAD GONE THERE FORMULATED ITSELF IN HER MIND THE THOUGHT THAT IF LORD COOMBE AND MISSUS BENNETT MET HER TOGETHER SOME CLARITY MIGHT BE REACHED
3703-71531-0038 BUT THEN AGAIN SHE SAID TO HERSELF OH WHY AFTER ALL SHOULD SHE BE ASKED QUESTIONS WHAT CAN IT MATTER TO THE REST OF THE WOEFUL WORLD IF SHE HIDES IT FOREVER IN HER HEART
3703-71550-0000 SINCE THE DOWAGER TOOK HER UP SHE'S FAR TOO GRAND FOR THE LIKES OF US SHE SAID SO TO SPEAK FEATHER BLEW ABOUT FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER SHE HAD NEVER FOUND LIFE SO EXCITING
3703-71550-0001 AND EXCITEMENT HAD BECOME MORE VITALLY NECESSARY TO HER EXISTENCE AS THE YEARS HAD PASSED SHE STILL LOOKED EXTRAORDINARILY YOUTHFUL AND IF HER FACE WAS AT TIMES RATHER MARVELOUS
3703-71550-0002 IN ITS WHITE AND RED AND HER LIPS DARING IN THEIR POMEGRANATE SCARLET THE FINE GRAIN OF HER SKIN AIDED HER EFFECTS AND SHE WAS DAZZLINGLY IN THE FASHION SHE HAD NEVER WORN SUCH ENCHANTING CLOTHES
3703-71550-0003 AND NEVER HAD SEEMED TO POSSESS SO MANY I TWIST MY RAGS TOGETHER MYSELF SHE USED TO LAUGH THAT'S MY GIFT HELENE SAYS I HAVE GENIUS
3703-71550-0004 OUT OF ONE OF YOUR OLD PETTICOATS AND MINE WERE NEVER VERY OLD THERE WAS PROBABLY A MODICUM OF TRUTH IN THIS THE FACT REMAINED THAT THE GARMENTS WHICH WERE MORE SCANT AND SHORTER THAN THOSE OF ANY OTHER FEATHERY PERSON
3703-71550-0005 WERE ALSO MORE NUMEROUS AND EXQUISITE HER PATRIOTIC ENTERTAINMENT OF SOLDIERS WHO REQUIRED HER SPECIAL ORDER OF SUPPORT AND RECREATION WAS FAST AND FURIOUS
3703-71550-0006 SHE DANCED WITH THEM AT CABARETS SHE DANCED AS A NYMPH FOR PATRIOTIC ENTERTAINMENTS WITH SNOW WHITE BARE FEET AND LEGS
3703-71550-0007 AND LEAVES AND PRIMROSES SHE WAS SUCH A SUCCESS THAT IMPORTANT PERSONAGES SMILED ON HER AND ASKED HER TO APPEAR UNDER UNDREAMED OF AUSPICES
3703-71550-0008 SECRETLY TRIUMPHANT THOUGH SHE WAS SHE NEVER SO FAR LOST HER HEAD AS TO DO ANYTHING WHICH WOULD BORE HER OR CAUSE HER TO APPEAR AT LESS THAN AN ALLURING ADVANTAGE
3703-71550-0009 WHEN SHE COULD INVENT A PARTICULARLY UNIQUE AND INSPIRING SHRED OF A GARMENT TO STARTLE THE PUBLIC WITH SHE DANCED FOR SOME NOBLE OBJECT AND INTOXICATED HERSELF WITH THE DAZZLE OF LIGHT AND APPLAUSE
3703-71550-0010 THOSE SO EXCITED SOMEHOW SEEMED TO FEEL THEMSELVES IMMUNE FEATHER CHATTERED ABOUT ZEPPS AS IF BOMBS COULD ONLY WREAK THEIR VENGEANCE UPON COAST TOWNS AND THE LOWER ORDERS WHEN LORD COOMBE
3703-71550-0011 AND HAD PREPARED PLACES FOR THEMSELVES SOMETIMES SHE WAS EVEN RATHER INDECENTLY EXHILARATED BY HER SENSE OF HIGH ADVENTURE THE FACT WAS THAT THE EXCITEMENT OF THE SEETHING WORLD ABOUT HER
3703-71550-0012 HAD OVERSTRUNG HER TRIVIAL BEING AND TURNED HER LIGHT HEAD UNTIL IT WHIRLED TOO FAST IT MAY SEEM HORRID TO SAY SO AND I'M NOT HORRID BUT I LIKE THE WAR YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
3703-71550-0013 COMING AND GOING IN SWARMS AND BEING SO GRATEFUL FOR KINDNESS AND ENTERTAINMENT ONE IS REALLY DOING GOOD ALL THE TIME AND BEING ADORED FOR IT
3703-71550-0014 I OWN I LIKE BEING ADORED MYSELF AND OF COURSE ONE LIKES DOING GOOD I NEVER WAS SO HAPPY IN MY LIFE I USED TO BE RATHER A COWARD I SUPPOSE
3703-71550-0015 SHE CHATTERED GAILY ON ANOTHER OCCASION I WAS HORRIBLY AFRAID OF THINGS I BELIEVE THE WAR AND LIVING AMONG SOLDIERS HAS HAD AN EFFECT ON ME AND MADE ME BRAVER THE ZEPPS DON'T FRIGHTEN ME AT ALL
3703-71550-0016 AT LEAST THEY EXCITE ME SO THAT THEY MAKE ME FORGET TO BE FRIGHTENED I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO TO ME EXACTLY THE WHOLE THING GETS INTO MY HEAD AND MAKES ME WANT TO RUSH ABOUT AND SEE EVERYTHING
3703-71550-0017 APART FROM WHICH HIS HOURS WERE FILLED HE ALSO OBJECTED TO A CERTAIN RAFFISHNESS WHICH IN AN EXTREMELY MIXED CROWD OF PATRIOTS RATHER TOO OBVIOUSLY SWEPT AWAY SILLY OLD FADS
3703-71550-0018 AND LEFT THE TRULY ADVANCED TO DO AS THEY LIKED WHAT THEY LIKED HE DID NOT AND WAS WHOLLY UNDISTURBED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF BEING CONSIDERED A RIGID OLD FOSSIL
3703-71550-0019 FEATHER HERSELF HAD NO NEED OF HIM AN ATHLETIC AND PARTICULARLY WELL FAVOURED YOUNG ACTOR WHO SHARED HER THRILLS OF ELATION SEEMED TO PERMEATE THE ATMOSPHERE ABOUT HER
3703-71550-0020 ARE WE GROWING CALLOUS OR ARE WE LOSING OUR WITS THROUGH LIVING AT SUCH HIGH TEMPERATURE THE DUCHESS ASKED THERE'S A DELIRIUM IN THE AIR AMONG THOSE WHO ARE NOT SHUDDERING IN CELLARS
3703-71550-0021 THERE ARE SOME WHO SEEM POSSESSED BY A SORT OF LIGHT INSANITY HALF DEFIANCE HALF EXCITED CURIOSITY PEOPLE SAY EXULTANTLY
3703-71550-0022 I HAD A PERFECTLY SPLENDID VIEW OF THE LAST ZEPP A MOTHER WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS PAYING HER A VISIT SAID TO HER I WISH YOU COULD HAVE SEEN THE ZEPPS WHILE YOU WERE HERE IT IS SUCH AN EXPERIENCE
3703-71550-0023 HAD INCREASED AND WAS MORE DEEPLY TOUCHED WITH AWE SHE OPENED CERTAIN WINDOWS EVERY NIGHT AND FELT THAT SHE WAS LIVING IN THE WORLD OF SUPERNATURAL THINGS ROBIN'S EYES SOMETIMES GAVE HER A GHOST OF A SHOCK
3703-71550-0024 WHEN SHE CAME UPON HER SITTING ALONE WITH HER WORK IN HER IDLE HANDS BUT SUPPORTED BY THE TESTIMONY OF SUCH REALITIES AS BREAKFASTS LONG UNTIRING WALKS
3703-71550-0025 AND UNVARYING BLOOMING HEALTHFULNESS SHE THANKED GOD HOURLY DOCTOR BENTON SAYS PLAIN THAT HE HAS NEVER HAD SUCH A BEAUTIFUL CASE AND ONE THAT PROMISED SO WELL SHE WROTE
3703-71550-0026 AND HE TELLS ME I NEED NOT LOOK FORWARD WITH DREAD AS PERHAPS I HAD BEEN DOING ROBIN HERSELF WROTE TO COOMBE LETTERS WHOSE TENDER HEARTED COMPREHENSION OF WHAT HE WAS DOING ALWAYS HELD THE DESIRE TO SURROUND HIM
3703-71550-0027 WITH THE SOOTHING QUIET HE HAD SO FELT WHEN HE WAS WITH HER WHAT HE DISCOVERED WAS THAT SHE HAD BEEN BORN OF THE ELECT THE WOMEN WHO KNOW WHAT TO SAY WHAT TO LET OTHERS SAY
3703-71550-0028 AND WHAT TO BEAUTIFULLY LEAVE UNSAID HER UNCONSCIOUS GENIUS WAS QUITE EXQUISITE NOW AND THEN HE MADE THE NIGHT JOURNEY TO DARREUCH CASTLE AND EACH TIME SHE MET HIM
3703-71550-0029 WHICH SHE SHOWED HIM WITH UNAFFECTED SWEETNESS SHE TOLD HIM STORIES OF DOWIE AND MADEMOISELLE AND HOW THEY HAD TAUGHT HER TO SEW AND EMBROIDER ONCE SHE TOLD HIM THE STORY OF HER FIRST MEETING WITH DONAL
3703-71550-0030 BUT SHE PASSED OVER THE TRAGEDY OF THEIR FIRST PARTING IT WAS TOO SAD SHE SAID HE NOTICED THAT SHE NEVER SPOKE OF SAD AND DARK HOURS
3703-71550-0031 HE WAS CONVINCED THAT SHE PURPOSELY AVOIDED THEM AND HE WAS PROFOUNDLY GLAD I KNOW SHE SAID ONCE THAT YOU DO NOT WANT ME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE WAR THANK YOU FOR KNOWING IT
3703-71550-0032 HE ANSWERED I COME HERE ON A PILGRIMAGE TO A SHRINE WHERE PEACE IS DARREUCH IS MY SHRINE IT IS MINE TOO WAS HER LOW RESPONSE YES I THINK IT IS
3703-71550-0033 HIS LOOK AT HER WAS DEEP SUDDENLY BUT GENTLY HE LAID HIS HAND ON HER SHOULDER I BEG YOU HE SAID FERVENTLY I BEG YOU NEVER TO ALLOW YOURSELF TO THINK OF IT
3703-71550-0034 YOU ARE HERE FOR YOU THERE MUST BE NO WAR HOW KIND HIS FACE LOOKED WAS ROBIN'S THOUGHT AS HE HESITATED A SECOND AND THEN WENT ON
3703-71550-0035 I KNOW VERY LITTLE OF SUCH SACROSANCT THINGS AS MOTHERS AND CHILDREN BUT LATELY I HAVE HAD FANCIES OF A PLACE FOR THEM WHERE THERE ARE ONLY SMILES AND HAPPINESS AND BEAUTY AS A BEGINNING
3703-71550-0036 IT WAS SHE WHO NOW PUT HER HAND ON HIS ARM
3703-73732-0000 AS FOR FERDINAND THE SPRING HAD GRADUALLY RESTORED HIM TO HEALTH BUT NOT TO HIS FORMER FRAME OF MIND HE REMAINED MOODY AND INDOLENT INCAPABLE OF EXERTION AND A PREY TO THE DARKEST HUMOURS
3703-73732-0001 CIRCUMSTANCES HOWEVER OCCURRED WHICH RENDERED SOME ENERGY ON HIS PART ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY HIS CREDITORS GREW IMPORTUNATE AND THE ARRANGEMENT OF HIS AFFAIRS OR DEPARTURE FROM HIS NATIVE LAND
3703-73732-0002 WAS AN ALTERNATIVE NOW INEVITABLE THE MONTH OF APRIL
3703-73732-0003 WELCOMED ALSO TO LONDON MISS GRANDISON AND HER GUESTS A FEW WEEKS AFTER FERDINAND WHO HAD EVADED THE JOURNEY WITH HIS FAMILY AND WHO WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT BECOME A GUEST OF HIS COUSIN
3703-73732-0004 SETTLED HIMSELF DOWN AT A QUIET HOTEL IN THE VICINITY OF GROSVENOR SQUARE
3703-73732-0005 AND HIS BLIGHTED HOPES WITHOUT RESERVE ACCEDED TO HIS WISH WITH THE GREATEST SATISFACTION A SUDDEN RESIDENCE IN A VAST METROPOLIS AFTER A LIFE OF RURAL SECLUSION HAS WITHOUT DOUBT
3703-73732-0006 THE NOISE THE BUSTLE THE GENERAL AND WIDELY SPREAD EXCITEMENT ALL COMBINE TO MAKE US KEENLY SENSIBLE OF OUR INDIVIDUAL INSIGNIFICANCE AND THOSE ABSORBING PASSIONS THAT IN OUR SOLITUDE
3703-73732-0007 FED BY OUR IMAGINATION HAVE ASSUMED SUCH GIGANTIC AND SUBSTANTIAL SHAPES RAPIDLY SUBSIDE BY AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE PROCESS INTO LESS COLOSSAL PROPORTIONS AND SEEM INVESTED
3703-73732-0008 AS IT WERE WITH A MORE SHADOWY ASPECT AS FERDINAND ARMINE JOSTLED HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWDED STREETS OF LONDON URGED ON BY HIS OWN HARASSING AND INEXORABLE AFFAIRS
3703-73732-0009 AND CONSCIOUS OF THE IMPENDING PERIL OF HIS CAREER WHILE POWER AND WEALTH DAZZLED HIS EYES IN ALL DIRECTIONS HE BEGAN TO LOOK BACK UPON THE PASSIONATE PAST WITH FEELINGS OF LESS KEEN SENSATION THAN HERETOFORE
3703-73732-0010 AND ALMOST TO REGRET THAT A FATAL DESTINY OR HIS IMPETUOUS SOUL HAD ENTAILED UPON HIM SO MUCH ANXIETY AND PROMPTED HIM TO REJECT THE GLITTERING CUP OF FORTUNE THAT HAD BEEN PROFFERED TO HIM SO OPPORTUNELY
3703-73732-0011 HE SIGHED FOR ENJOYMENT AND REPOSE THE MEMORY OF HIS RECENT SUFFERINGS MADE HIM SHRINK FROM THAT RECKLESS INDULGENCE OF THE PASSIONS OF WHICH THE CONSEQUENCES HAD BEEN SO SEVERE
3703-73732-0012 IT WAS IN THIS MOOD EXHAUSTED BY A VISIT TO HIS LAWYER THAT HE STEPPED INTO A MILITARY CLUB AND TOOK UP A NEWSPAPER CARING LITTLE FOR POLITICS HIS EYE WANDERED OVER UNINTERESTED
3703-73732-0013 ITS PUGNACIOUS LEADING ARTICLES AND TEDIOUS PARLIAMENTARY REPORTS AND HE WAS ABOUT TO THROW IT DOWN WHEN A PARAGRAPH CAUGHT HIS NOTICE WHICH INSTANTLY ENGROSSED ALL HIS ATTENTION IT WAS IN THE MORNING POST THAT HE THUS READ
3703-73732-0014 WHOSE RETURN TO ENGLAND WE RECENTLY NOTICED HAS RESIDED FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN ITALY HIS LORDSHIP IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED NOBLEMEN OF THE DAY AND WAS CELEBRATED AT ROME FOR HIS PATRONAGE OF THE ARTS
3703-73732-0015 LORD MONTFORT WILL SHORTLY BE UNITED TO THE BEAUTIFUL MISS TEMPLE THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PELHAM TEMPLE MISS TEMPLE IS ESTEEMED ONE OF THE RICHEST HEIRESSES IN ENGLAND AS SHE WILL DOUBTLESS INHERIT THE WHOLE OF THE IMMENSE FORTUNE
3703-73732-0016 TO WHICH HER FATHER SO UNEXPECTEDLY ACCEDED MISTER TEMPLE IS A WIDOWER AND HAS NO SON MISTER TEMPLE WAS FORMERLY OUR MINISTER AT SEVERAL OF THE GERMAN COURTS WHERE HE WAS DISTINGUISHED BY HIS ABILITIES
3703-73732-0017 WE UNDERSTAND THAT MISTER TEMPLE
3703-73732-0018 LORD MONTFORT ACCOMPANIED MISTER TEMPLE AND HIS AMIABLE DAUGHTER TO THIS COUNTRY WHAT A WILD AND FIERY CHAOS WAS THE MIND OF FERDINAND ARMINE WHEN HE READ THIS PARAGRAPH
3703-73732-0019 THE WONDERS IT REVEALED SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER WITH SUCH RAPIDITY THAT FOR SOME TIME HE WAS DEPRIVED OF THE POWER OF REFLECTION HENRIETTA TEMPLE IN ENGLAND HENRIETTA TEMPLE
3703-73732-0020 WHOSE BEAUTIFUL LOCK OF HAIR WAS AT THIS VERY MOMENT ON HIS HEART THE HENRIETTA TEMPLE FOR WHOM HE HAD FORFEITED FORTUNE FAMILY POWER ALMOST LIFE O WOMAN WOMAN
3703-73732-0021 WAS THERE ANOTHER TO WHOM SHE HAD POURED FORTH HER HEART AS TO HIM AND ALL THAT BEAUTIFUL FLOW OF FASCINATING AND UNRIVALLED EMOTION WAS THERE ANOTHER TO WHOM SHE HAD PLEDGED HER PURE AND PASSIONATE SOUL AH NO
3703-73732-0022 HE WOULD NOT HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT LIGHT AND FALSE HENRIETTA COULD NEVER BE SHE HAD BEEN SEEN SHE HAD BEEN ADMIRED SHE HAD BEEN LOVED WHO THAT SAW HER WOULD NOT ADMIRE AND LOVE
3703-73732-0023 AND HE WAS THE VICTIM OF HER PIQUE PERHAPS OF HER DESPAIR BUT SHE WAS NOT YET MARRIED THEY WERE ACCORDING TO THESE LINES TO BE SOON UNITED
3703-73732-0024 WHOSE ACCENTS HAD ONCE BEEN HER JOY THAT GLANCE WHICH HAD ONCE FILLED HER HEART WITH RAPTURE AND WHEN SHE FOUND THAT FERDINAND HER OWN FERDINAND HAD INDEED NEVER DECEIVED HER WAS WORTHY OF HER CHOICE AFFECTION
3703-73732-0025 AND SUFFERING EVEN AT THIS MOMENT FOR HER SWEET SAKE WHAT WERE ALL THE COLD BLOODED TIES
3703-73732-0026 SHOULD HE NOT CLAIM HIS RIGHT COULD SHE DENY IT CLAIM WHAT THE HAND OF AN HEIRESS SHOULD IT BE SAID THAT AN ARMINE CAME CROUCHING FOR LUCRE WHERE
3703-73732-0027 NEVER WHATEVER SHE MIGHT THINK HIS CONDUCT HAD BEEN FAULTLESS TO HER IT WAS NOT FOR HENRIETTA TO COMPLAIN SHE WAS NOT THE VICTIM IF ONE INDEED THERE MIGHT CHANCE TO BE HE HAD LOVED HER
3703-73732-0028 SHE HAD RETURNED HIS PASSION FOR HER SAKE HE HAD MADE THE GREATEST OF SACRIFICES FORFEITED A SPLENDID INHERITANCE AND A FOND AND FAITHFUL HEART WHEN HE HAD THOUGHT OF HER BEFORE PINING PERHAPS IN SOME FOREIGN SOLITUDE
3703-73732-0029 HE HAD NEVER CEASED REPROACHING HIMSELF FOR HIS CONDUCT AND HAD ACCUSED HIMSELF OF DECEPTION AND CRUELTY BUT NOW IN THIS MOMENT OF HER FLUSH PROSPERITY ESTEEMED ONE OF THE RICHEST HEIRESSES IN ENGLAND
3703-73732-0030 HE GROUND HIS TEETH AS HE RECALLED THAT PHRASE AND THE AFFIANCED BRIDE OF A GREAT NOBLE HIS OLD COMPANION LORD MONTFORT TOO WHAT A STRANGE THING IS LIFE PROUD SMILING AND PROSPEROUS
3703-73732-0031 WHILE HE WAS ALONE WITH A BROKEN HEART AND WORSE THAN DESPERATE FORTUNES AND ALL FOR HER SAKE HIS SOUL BECAME BITTER HE REPROACHED HER WITH WANT OF FEELING HE PICTURED HER AS VOID OF GENUINE SENSIBILITY
3703-73732-0032 HE DILATED ON HER INDIFFERENCE SINCE THEY HAD PARTED HER SILENCE SO STRANGE NOW NO LONGER INEXPLICABLE THE TOTAL WANT OF INTEREST SHE HAD EXHIBITED AS TO HIS CAREER HE SNEERED AT THE LIGHTNESS OF HER TEMPERAMENT
3703-73732-0033 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EXPERIENCED THE MADDENING PANGS OF JEALOUSY YET HOW HE HAD LOVED THIS WOMAN HOW HE HAD DOATED ON HER AND NOW THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO HAPPY THERE IS NOTHING THAT DEPRESSES A MAN SO MUCH
3703-73732-0034 AS THE CONVICTION OF BAD FORTUNE THERE SEEMED IN THIS SUDDEN RETURN GREAT WEALTH AND IMPENDING MARRIAGE OF HENRIETTA TEMPLE SUCH A COMBINATION SO FAR AS FERDINAND ARMINE WAS CONCERNED
3703-73732-0035 OF VEXATIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD APPEAR THAT HE HAD BEEN SO NEAR PERFECT HAPPINESS
3703-73732-0036 IT SO HAPPENED THAT HE HAD PROMISED THIS DAY TO DINE AT HIS COUSIN'S FOR GLASTONBURY WHO WAS USUALLY HIS COMPANION HAD ACCEPTED AN INVITATION THIS DAY TO DINE WITH THE NOBLE WIDOW OF HIS OLD PATRON
3717-178149-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE HE HAD BEEN DROWNED HE WAS FLOATING IN A SEA OF LIGHT AND NOW AND THEN SHINING LITTLE FISHES SWAM INQUISITIVELY UP TO HIM AND STARED
3717-178149-0001 LEAVING A FLASHING WAKE BEHIND THEM THEY HURTLED THROUGH THE MURKY LIGHT LIKE SHOOTING STARS AND ONCE TWO OF THEM DASHED TOGETHER AND BURST LIKE A ROCKET
3717-178149-0002 THE SPARKS CAME FALLING DOWN THROUGH A BILLION MILES OF SPACE AND AS THEY FELL THEY BUILT UP PLANETS AND SYSTEMS OF THEIR OWN UNTIL A DARK COIL THAT HAD THE SHAPE OF A DRAGON SLITHERED ACROSS THE MILKY WAY
3717-178149-0003 MURMURING SOUND IT WAS NEITHER SAD NOR GLAD SOMETHING LIKE THE SOUND THAT THE LAST BEE OF AUTUMN MAKES
3717-178149-0004 SOMETHING WAS FALLING ACROSS THE BACK OF HIS NECK AND SPREADING OUT ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS LIKE A WOMAN'S HAIR HE THOUGHT PERHAPS IT WAS A BIT COARSER BUT NOT MUCH
3717-178149-0005 BUT THEN JUST AS THE STRANGE SOOTHING FEELING WAS PUTTING HIM BACK TO SLEEP THE HAIRS CHANGED THEIR SOFT CARESS AND A DOZEN OF THEM PLUNGED INTO HIS SPINAL CORD
3717-178149-0006 WHERE ALL THE BOGIES OF THE STONE AGE STILL COWERED ODIN YELLED IN PAIN AND FOUGHT BUT THE HANDS HELD HIM TIGHT IN HIS EARS HE COULD HEAR SOMEONE ELSE SCREAMING AND CURSING THREATENING ALL SORTS OF VENGEANCE
3717-178149-0007 THE VOICE WAS GUNNAR'S THREE TIMES MORE THE SOFT MANE OF HAIR CARESSED HIM AND THREE TIMES MORE JUST AS HE WAS GETTING READY TO GO BACK TO SLEEP THE TORTURE BEGAN
3717-178149-0008 AND ALL THE WHILE HE WAS LYING UPON HIS BELLY HIS FACE THRUST INTO A PILLOW
3717-178149-0009 THE HANDS HELD HIM SECURELY AND ONCE WHEN HE ALMOST STRUGGLED CLEAR A STRONG KNEE WAS THRUST INTO HIS BACK AND FORCED HIM DOWN AT INTERVALS HE COULD HEAR GUNNAR'S VOICE AND HIS OWN
3717-178149-0010 CRYING PLEADING THREATENING THEN AT LAST IT WAS OVER THE HANDS TURNED ODIN UPON HIS BACK AND HE LAY THERE GASPING AND HURTING LIKE ONE WHO HAS JUST COME UP FROM DEEP WATER
3717-178149-0011 THE LIGHTS WERE SO BRIGHT THAT AT FIRST HE COULD SEE NOTHING THEN HIS VISION CLEARED
3717-178149-0012 TRYING TO REASSURE HIM BESIDE ODIN ON ANOTHER BED WAS GUNNAR LYING FLAT ON HIS BACK AND STRIPPED TO THE WAIST GUNNAR WAS HOWLING CURSES AND KICKING LIKE A FROG A DOCTOR AND A NURSE WERE THERE
3717-178149-0013 AND FOR A SECOND SHE LOOKED LIKE A HIGH PRIESTESS OF THE AMAZON HOLDING TWO MUMMIFIED HEADS BEFORE HER THE PAIN LEFT HIM HIS MIND CLEARED AND HE LAY THERE GASPING FROM THE ORDEAL
3717-178149-0014 SO CHEERFULLY THAT HE ALMOST EXPECTED THEM TO WRITE OUT A BILL FOR SURGICAL FEES GOD THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE
3717-178149-0015 AND WIPED HIS FOREHEAD FIVE HOURS OF IT AND IT WAS TOUCH AND GO ALL THE TIME WHAT HAPPENED ODIN ASKED HE REMEMBERED SOMETHING ABOUT A GLITTERING TOMB
3717-178149-0016 TELL HIM NEA
3717-178149-0017 SHE SMILED PROUDLY IT WAS MY INVENTION THAT SAVED YOU YOU SEE I HAVE TWO OF THEM NOW I TOLD YOU
3717-178149-0018 AND I ALSO TOLD YOU THAT THERE IS MUCH MORE TO THEM THAN YOU SAW THEY ARE DESTROYERS AND THEY ARE BUILDERS WE FOUND YOU DEAD OR NEARLY SO HAGEN HAD SENT VOLT AFTER VOLT THROUGH YOUR BODIES
3717-178149-0019 MIGHT SAY THAT WE ARE MASTER ELECTRONICIANS REBUILDING CIRCUITS REPAIRING TRANSISTORS AND CONDENSERS YOU WERE PLENTY ROUGH GUNNAR GRUMBLED WE HAD TO BE

3717-21493-0000 THE WOUNDED LION CUENTOS POPULARS CATALANS THERE WAS ONCE A GIRL SO POOR THAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO LIVE ON AND WANDERED ABOUT THE WORLD ASKING FOR CHARITY ONE DAY
3717-21493-0001 SHE ARRIVED AT A THATCHED COTTAGE AND INQUIRED IF THEY COULD GIVE HER ANY WORK THE FARMER SAID HE WANTED A COWHERD AS HIS OWN HAD LEFT HIM AND IF THE GIRL LIKED THE PLACE SHE MIGHT TAKE IT SO SHE BECAME A COWHERD
3717-21493-0002 ONE MORNING SHE WAS DRIVING HER COWS THROUGH THE MEADOWS WHEN SHE HEARD NEAR BY A LOUD GROAN THAT ALMOST SOUNDED HUMAN SHE HASTENED TO THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE NOISE CAME AND FOUND IT PROCEEDED FROM A LION
3717-21493-0003 WHO LAY STRETCHED UPON THE GROUND YOU CAN GUESS HOW FRIGHTENED SHE WAS BUT THE LION SEEMED IN SUCH PAIN THAT SHE WAS SORRY FOR HIM AND DREW NEARER AND NEARER TILL SHE SAW HE HAD A LARGE THORN IN ONE FOOT
3717-21493-0004 BUT THEY HAD GONE AND THOUGH SHE HUNTED EVERYWHERE SHE NEVER FOUND THEM AND SHE HAD TO RETURN HOME AND CONFESS TO HER MASTER WHO SCOLDED HER BITTERLY AND AFTERWARDS BEAT HER THEN HE SAID NOW YOU WILL HAVE TO LOOK AFTER THE ASSES
3717-21493-0005 SO EVERY DAY SHE HAD TO TAKE THE ASSES TO THE WOODS TO FEED UNTIL ONE MORNING EXACTLY A YEAR AFTER SHE HAD FOUND THE LION SHE HEARD A GROAN WHICH SOUNDED QUITE HUMAN SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH THE NOISE CAME AND
3717-21493-0006 TO HER GREAT SURPRISE BEHELD THE SAME LION STRETCHED ON THE GROUND WITH A DEEP WOUND ACROSS HIS FACE THIS TIME SHE WAS NOT AFRAID AT ALL AND RAN TOWARDS HIM WASHING THE WOUND AND LAYING SOOTHING HERBS UPON IT
3717-21493-0007 AND WHEN SHE HAD BOUND IT UP THE LION THANKED HER IN THE SAME MANNER AS BEFORE AFTER THAT SHE RETURNED TO HER FLOCK BUT THEY WERE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN SHE SEARCHED HERE AND SHE SEARCHED THERE BUT THEY HAD VANISHED COMPLETELY
3717-21493-0008 THEN SHE HAD TO GO HOME AND CONFESS TO HER MASTER WHO FIRST SCOLDED HER AND AFTERWARDS BEAT HER NOW GO HE ENDED AND LOOK AFTER THE PIGS SO THE NEXT DAY SHE TOOK OUT THE PIGS
3717-21493-0009 AND FOUND THEM SUCH GOOD FEEDING GROUNDS THAT THEY GREW FATTER EVERY DAY ANOTHER YEAR PASSED BY AND ONE MORNING WHEN THE MAIDEN WAS OUT WITH HER PIGS SHE HEARD A GROAN WHICH SOUNDED QUITE HUMAN SHE RAN TO SEE WHAT IT WAS
3717-21493-0010 AND FOUND HER OLD FRIEND THE LION WOUNDED THROUGH AND THROUGH FAST DYING UNDER A TREE SHE FELL ON HER KNEES BEFORE HIM AND WASHED HIS WOUNDS ONE BY ONE AND LAID HEALING HERBS UPON THEM AND THE LION LICKED HER HANDS AND THANKED HER
3717-21493-0011 AND ASKED IF SHE WOULD NOT STAY AND SIT BY HIM BUT THE GIRL SAID SHE HAD HER PIGS TO WATCH AND SHE MUST GO AND SEE AFTER THEM
3717-21493-0012 BUT THEY HAD VANISHED AS IF THE EARTH HAD SWALLOWED THEM UP SHE WHISTLED AND CALLED BUT ONLY THE BIRDS ANSWERED HER THEN SHE SANK DOWN ON THE GROUND AND WEPT BITTERLY
3717-21493-0013 NEXT SHE THOUGHT I WILL NOT STIR FROM HERE TILL I SEE HIM COME OUT AND DISCOVER WHO HE IS ACCORDINGLY SHE WAITED AND AT DAWN THE NEXT MORNING THE ROCK MOVED TO ONE SIDE AND A LION CAME OUT
3717-21493-0014 HE PUSHED ASIDE THE ROCK AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND IT NEXT MORNING OUT CAME THE LION HE LOOKED SHARPLY ABOUT HIM ON ALL SIDES BUT SAW NO ONE AND THEN VANISHED INTO THE FOREST
3717-21493-0015 THE MAIDEN THEN CAME DOWN FROM THE TREE AND DID EXACTLY AS SHE HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE THUS THREE DAYS WENT BY AND EVERY DAY SHE WENT AND TIDIED UP THE PALACE AT LENGTH WHEN THE GIRL FOUND SHE WAS NO NEARER TO DISCOVERING THE SECRET
3717-21493-0016 SHE RESOLVED TO ASK HIM AND IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM COMING THROUGH THE WOOD SHE CAME DOWN FROM THE TREE AND BEGGED HIM TO TELL HER HIS NAME THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED VERY PLEASED TO SEE HER
3717-21493-0017 AND SAID HE THOUGHT IT MUST BE SHE WHO HAD SECRETLY KEPT HIS HOUSE FOR SO MANY DAYS AND HE ADDED THAT HE WAS A PRINCE ENCHANTED BY A POWERFUL GIANT BUT WAS ONLY ALLOWED TO TAKE HIS OWN SHAPE AT NIGHT FOR ALL DAY HE WAS FORCED TO APPEAR AS THE LION WHOM SHE HAD SO OFTEN HELPED
3717-21493-0018 AND MORE THAN THIS IT WAS THE GIANT WHO HAD STOLEN THE OXEN AND THE ASSES AND THE PIGS IN REVENGE FOR HER KINDNESS AND THE GIRL ASKED HIM WHAT CAN I DO TO DISENCHANT YOU BUT HE SAID HE WAS AFRAID IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT
3717-21493-0019 BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY WAS TO GET A LOCK OF HAIR FROM THE HEAD OF A KING'S DAUGHTER TO SPIN IT AND TO MAKE FROM IT A CLOAK FOR THE GIANT WHO LIVED UP ON THE TOP OF A HIGH MOUNTAIN VERY WELL ANSWERED THE GIRL I WILL GO TO THE CITY
3717-21493-0020 AND KNOCK AT THE DOOR OF THE KING'S PALACE AND ASK THE PRINCESS TO TAKE ME AS A SERVANT SO THEY PARTED AND WHEN SHE ARRIVED AT THE CITY SHE WALKED ABOUT THE STREETS CRYING WHO WILL HIRE ME FOR A SERVANT WHO WILL HIRE ME FOR A SERVANT BUT
3717-21493-0021 THOUGH MANY PEOPLE LIKED HER LOOKS FOR SHE WAS CLEAN AND NEAT THE MAIDEN WOULD LISTEN TO NONE AND STILL CONTINUED CRYING WHO WILL HIRE ME FOR A SERVANT WHO WILL HIRE ME FOR A SERVANT AT LAST THERE CAME THE WAITING MAID OF THE PRINCESS
3717-21493-0022 WHAT CAN YOU DO SHE SAID
3717-21493-0023 BY AND BYE IT CAME TO THE EARS OF THE PRINCESS AND SHE SENT FOR THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SAW HER AND HOW BEAUTIFULLY SHE HAD DRESSED HER HAIR THE PRINCESS TOLD HER SHE WAS TO COME AND COMB OUT HERS NOW THE HAIR OF THE PRINCESS WAS VERY THICK AND LONG
3717-21493-0024 AND SHONE LIKE THE SUN AND THE GIRL COMBED IT AND COMBED IT TILL IT WAS BRIGHTER THAN EVER AND THE PRINCESS WAS PLEASED AND BADE HER COME EVERY DAY AND COMB HER HAIR TILL AT LENGTH THE GIRL TOOK COURAGE AND BEGGED LEAVE TO CUT OFF ONE OF THE LONG THICK LOCKS
3717-21493-0025 THE PRINCESS WHO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER HAIR DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF PARTING WITH ANY OF IT SO SHE SAID NO BUT THE GIRL COULD NOT GIVE UP HOPE AND EACH DAY SHE ENTREATED TO BE ALLOWED TO CUT OFF JUST ONE TRESS
3717-21493-0026 AT LENGTH THE PRINCESS LOST PATIENCE AND EXCLAIMED YOU MAY HAVE IT THEN ON CONDITION THAT YOU SHALL FIND THE HANDSOMEST PRINCE IN THE WORLD TO BE MY BRIDEGROOM AND THE GIRL ANSWERED THAT SHE WOULD
3717-21493-0027 AND CUT OFF THE LOCK AND WOVE IT INTO A COAT THAT GLITTERED LIKE SILK AND BROUGHT IT TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO TOLD HER TO CARRY IT STRAIGHT TO THE GIANT BUT THAT SHE MUST BE CAREFUL TO CRY OUT A LONG WAY OFF WHAT SHE HAD WITH HER OR ELSE HE WOULD SPRING UPON HER AND RUN HER THROUGH WITH HIS SWORD
3717-21493-0028 SO THE MAIDEN DEPARTED AND CLIMBED UP THE MOUNTAIN BUT BEFORE SHE REACHED THE TOP THE GIANT HEARD HER FOOTSTEPS AND RUSHED OUT BREATHING FIRE AND FLAME HAVING A SWORD IN ONE HAND AND A CLUB IN THE OTHER
3717-21493-0029 BUT SHE CRIED LOUDLY THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT HIM THE COAT AND THEN HE GREW QUIET AND INVITED HER TO COME INTO HIS HOUSE HE TRIED ON THE COAT BUT IT WAS TOO SHORT AND HE THREW IT OFF AND DECLARED IT WAS NO USE AND THE GIRL PICKED IT UP SADLY
3717-21493-0030 AND RETURNED QUITE IN DESPAIR TO THE KING'S PALACE THE NEXT MORNING WHEN SHE WAS COMBING THE PRINCESS'S HAIR SHE BEGGED LEAVE TO CUT OFF ANOTHER LOCK AT FIRST THE PRINCESS SAID NO BUT THE GIRL BEGGED SO HARD THAT AT LENGTH SHE GAVE IN ON CONDITION
3717-21493-0031 THE MAIDEN TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD ALREADY FOUND HIM AND SPUN THE LOCK INTO SHINING STUFF
3717-21493-0032 AND HE WAS QUITE PLEASED AND ASKED HER WHAT HE COULD GIVE HER IN RETURN AND SHE SAID THAT THE ONLY REWARD HE COULD GIVE HER WAS TO TAKE THE SPELL OFF THE LION AND BRING HIM BACK TO HIS OWN SHAPE FOR A LONG TIME THE GIANT WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT
3717-21493-0033 BUT IN THE END HE GAVE IN AND TOLD HER EXACTLY HOW IT MUST ALL BE DONE SHE WAS TO KILL THE LION HERSELF AND CUT HIM UP VERY SMALL THEN SHE MUST BURN HIM AND CAST HIS ASHES INTO THE WATER
3717-21493-0034 AND WEEPING SHE JOINED THE PRINCE WHO WAS AWAITING HER AT THE BOTTOM AND WHEN HE HAD HEARD HER STORY HE COMFORTED HER AND BADE HER BE OF GOOD COURAGE AND TO DO THE BIDDING OF THE GIANT AND THE MAIDEN BELIEVED WHAT THE PRINCE TOLD HER
3717-21493-0035 AND AS GLAD TO LOOK UPON AS THE SUN HIMSELF THEN THE YOUNG MAN THANKED THE MAIDEN FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE FOR HIM AND SAID SHE SHOULD BE HIS WIFE AND NONE OTHER BUT THE MAIDEN ONLY WEPT SORE
3717-21493-0036 THAT THE PRINCE SHOULD WED HER AND HER ONLY BUT THE PRINCE REPLIED IF IT IS THE PRINCESS WE MUST GO QUICKLY COME WITH ME SO THEY WENT TOGETHER TO THE KING'S PALACE
3717-21493-0037 AND WHEN THE KING AND QUEEN AND PRINCESS SAW THE YOUNG MAN A GREAT JOY FILLED THEIR HEARTS FOR THEY KNEW HIM FOR THE ELDEST SON WHO HAD LONG AGO BEEN ENCHANTED BY A GIANT AND LOST TO THEM
3717-21498-0000 THE HARDER SHE PULLED THE FIRMER SEEMED THE PLANT AND AT LAST DETERMINED NOT TO BE BEATEN SHE GAVE ONE GREAT TUG AND THE ROSEMARY REMAINED IN HER HANDS THEN SHE HEARD A VOICE CLOSE TO HER SAYING WELL
3717-21498-0001 AND TURNING SHE SAW BEFORE HER A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN WHO ASKED WHY SHE HAD COME TO STEAL HIS FIREWOOD THE GIRL WHO FELT MUCH CONFUSED ONLY MANAGED TO STAMMER OUT AS AN EXCUSE THAT HER FATHER HAD SENT HER
3717-21498-0002 VERY WELL REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN THEN COME WITH ME SO HE TOOK HER THROUGH THE OPENING MADE BY THE TORN UP ROOT AND THEY TRAVELLED TILL THEY REACHED A BEAUTIFUL PALACE SPLENDIDLY FURNISHED BUT ONLY LIGHTED FROM THE TOP
3717-21498-0003 AND WHEN THEY HAD ENTERED HE TOLD HER THAT HE WAS A GREAT LORD AND THAT NEVER HAD HE SEEN A MAIDEN SO BEAUTIFUL AS SHE AND THAT
3717-21498-0004 AND THE MAIDEN SAID YES SHE WOULD AND SO THEY WERE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY THE OLD DAME WHO LOOKED AFTER THE HOUSE HANDED HER ALL THE KEYS BUT POINTED HER OUT ONE THAT SHE WOULD DO WELL NEVER TO USE FOR IF SHE DID
3717-21498-0005 THE WHOLE PALACE WOULD FALL TO THE GROUND AND THE GRASS WOULD GROW OVER IT AND THE DAMSEL HERSELF WOULD BE REMEMBERED NO MORE THE BRIDE PROMISED TO BE CAREFUL BUT IN A LITTLE WHILE WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR HER TO DO
3717-21498-0006 SHE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT COULD BE IN THE CHEST WHICH WAS OPENED BY THE KEY AS EVERYBODY KNOWS IF WE ONCE BEGIN TO THINK WE SOON BEGIN TO DO AND IT WAS NOT VERY LONG BEFORE THE KEY WAS NO LONGER IN THE MAIDEN'S HAND
3717-21498-0007 BUT THE LOCK WAS STIFF AND RESISTED ALL HER EFFORTS AND IN THE END SHE HAD TO BREAK IT AND WHAT WAS INSIDE AFTER ALL
3717-21498-0008 BREAKING A SPRIG OF ROSEMARY OFF A BUSH HARD BY SHE RESOLVED COST WHAT IT MIGHT TO SEEK HIM THROUGH THE WORLD TILL SHE FOUND HIM SO SHE WALKED AND SHE WALKED AND SHE WALKED TILL SHE ARRIVED AT A HOUSE BUILT OF STRAW AND SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
3717-21498-0009 AND HER MISTRESS ANSWERED HER WHERE HE IS NONE CAN TELL BETTER THAN THE SUN THE MOON AND THE WIND FOR THEY GO EVERYWHERE ON HEARING THESE WORDS THE DAMSEL SET FORTH ONCE MORE
3717-21498-0010 AND WALKED TILL SHE REACHED THE GOLDEN CASTLE WHERE LIVED THE SUN AND SHE KNOCKED BOLDLY AT THE DOOR SAYING ALL HAIL O SUN I HAVE COME TO ASK IF OF YOUR CHARITY YOU WILL HELP ME IN MY NEED
3717-21498-0011 AND I AM WEARY FOR I SEEK MY HUSBAND THROUGH THE WIDE WORLD INDEED SPOKE THE SUN DO YOU RICH AS YOU ARE NEED HELP BUT THOUGH YOU LIVE IN A PALACE WITHOUT WINDOWS THE SUN ENTERS EVERYWHERE
3717-21498-0012 AND HE KNOWS YOU THEN THE BRIDE TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY AND DID NOT HIDE HER OWN ILL DOING AND THE SUN LISTENED AND WAS SORRY FOR HER AND THOUGH HE COULD NOT TELL HER WHERE TO GO HE GAVE HER A NUT
3717-21498-0013 ALL HAIL SAID THE GIRL
3717-21498-0014 TO ASK YOUR HELP IT IS MY MISTRESS THE MOON YOU SEEK I WILL TELL HER OF YOUR PRAYER SO THE MOON CAME OUT AND WHEN SHE SAW THE MAIDEN SHE KNEW HER AGAIN
3717-21498-0015 FOR SHE HAD WATCHED HER SLEEPING BOTH IN THE COTTAGE AND IN THE PALACE AND SHE SPAKE TO HER AND SAID DO YOU RICH AS YOU ARE NEED HELP THEN THE GIRL TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY AND THE MOON LISTENED
3717-21498-0016 TILL SHE CAME TO ANOTHER CASTLE AND SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND SAID ALL HAIL I HAVE COME TO ASK IF OF YOUR CHARITY YOU WILL HELP ME IN MY NEED IT IS MY LORD THE WIND THAT YOU WANT
3717-21498-0018 RICH AS YOU ARE WANT HELP AND SHE TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY AND THE WIND LISTENED AND WAS SORRY FOR HER AND HE GAVE HER A WALNUT THAT SHE WAS TO EAT IN TIME OF NEED
3717-21498-0019 BUT THE GIRL DID NOT GO AS THE WIND EXPECTED SHE WAS TIRED AND SAD AND KNEW NOT WHERE TO TURN SO SHE BEGAN TO WEEP BITTERLY THE WIND WEPT TOO FOR COMPANY AND SAID DON'T BE FRIGHTENED
3717-21498-0020 I WILL GO AND SEE IF I CAN FIND OUT SOMETHING AND THE WIND DEPARTED WITH A GREAT NOISE AND FUSS AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE HE WAS BACK AGAIN BEAMING WITH DELIGHT
3717-21498-0021 FROM WHAT ONE PERSON AND ANOTHER HAVE LET FALL HE EXCLAIMED I HAVE CONTRIVED TO LEARN THAT HE IS IN THE PALACE OF THE KING WHO KEEPS HIM HIDDEN LEST ANYONE SHOULD SEE HIM AND THAT TO MORROW HE IS TO MARRY THE PRINCESS
3717-21498-0022 HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY MAN TO WED HER WHO CAN TELL THE DESPAIR WHICH SEIZED THE POOR MAIDEN WHEN SHE HEARD THIS NEWS
3717-21498-0023 AS SOON AS SHE COULD SPEAK SHE IMPLORED THE WIND TO DO ALL HE COULD TO GET THE WEDDING PUT OFF FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS FOR IT WOULD TAKE HER ALL THAT TIME TO REACH THE PALACE OF THE KING THE WIND GLADLY PROMISED TO DO WHAT HE COULD
3717-21498-0024 CATCHING JUMPING CLIMBING BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE THE LACE WAS TORN THE SATIN STAINED THE PEARLS KNOCKED OFF
3717-21498-0025 IT WAS PLAINLY QUITE IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE WEDDING CLOTHES COULD BE READY NEXT DAY HOWEVER THE KING WAS MUCH TOO ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER MARRIED TO LISTEN TO ANY EXCUSES AND HE DECLARED THAT A DRESS MUST BE PUT TOGETHER SOMEHOW FOR THE BRIDE TO WEAR
3717-21498-0026 SO THAT THE TAILORS MIGHT TAKE THE DRESS TO PIECES AND MAKE IT FIT BUT BY THIS TIME THE MAIDEN HAD ARRIVED FOOTSORE AND WEARY AT THE CASTLE
3717-21498-0027 AND AS SOON AS SHE REACHED THE DOOR SHE CRACKED HER NUT AND DREW OUT OF IT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MANTLE IN THE WORLD THEN SHE RANG THE BELL AND ASKED IS NOT THE PRINCESS TO BE MARRIED TO DAY YES SHE IS
3717-21498-0028 ASK HER IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO BUY THIS MANTLE AND WHEN THE PRINCESS SAW THE MANTLE SHE WAS DELIGHTED FOR HER WEDDING MANTLE HAD BEEN SPOILT WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS AND IT WAS TOO LATE TO MAKE ANOTHER SO SHE TOLD THE MAIDEN TO ASK WHAT PRICE SHE WOULD
3717-21498-0029 AND IT SHOULD BE GIVEN HER THE MAIDEN FIXED A LARGE SUM MANY PIECES OF GOLD BUT THE PRINCESS HAD SET HER HEART ON THE MANTLE AND GAVE IT READILY NOW THE MAIDEN HID HER GOLD IN THE POCKET OF HER DRESS
3717-21498-0030 AND TURNED AWAY FROM THE CASTLE THE MOMENT SHE WAS OUT OF SIGHT SHE BROKE HER ALMOND AND DREW FROM IT THE MOST MAGNIFICENT PETTICOATS THAT EVER WERE SEEN THEN SHE WENT BACK TO THE CASTLE AND ASKED IF THE PRINCESS WISHED TO BUY ANY PETTICOATS
3717-21498-0031 NO SOONER DID THE PRINCESS CAST HER EYES ON THE PETTICOATS THAN SHE DECLARED THEY WERE EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE MANTLE AND THAT SHE WOULD GIVE THE MAIDEN WHATEVER PRICE SHE WANTED FOR THEM AND THE MAIDEN NAMED MANY PIECES OF GOLD
3717-21498-0032 WHICH THE PRINCESS PAID HER GLADLY SO PLEASED WAS SHE WITH HER NEW POSSESSIONS THEN THE GIRL WENT DOWN THE STEPS WHERE NONE COULD WATCH HER AND CRACKED HER WALNUT AND OUT CAME THE MOST SPLENDID COURT DRESS THAT ANY DRESSMAKER HAD EVER INVENTED
3717-21498-0033 AND CARRYING IT CAREFULLY IN HER ARMS SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND ASKED IF THE PRINCESS WISHED TO BUY A COURT DRESS WHEN THE MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED THE PRINCESS SPRANG TO HER FEET WITH DELIGHT FOR SHE HAD BEEN THINKING THAT
3717-21498-0034 AFTER ALL IT WAS NOT MUCH USE TO HAVE A LOVELY MANTLE AND ELEGANT PETTICOATS IF SHE HAD NO DRESS AND SHE KNEW THE TAILORS WOULD NEVER BE READY IN TIME SO SHE SENT AT ONCE TO SAY SHE WOULD BUY THE DRESS AND WHAT SUM DID THE MAIDEN WANT FOR IT
3717-21498-0035 AND CONTENTED HERSELF WITH THINKING THAT AFTER ALL IT DID NOT MATTER MUCH SO THE MAIDEN WAS LED TO THE ROOMS WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HER HUSBAND AND WHEN SHE CAME NEAR SHE TOUCHED HIM WITH THE SPRIG OF ROSEMARY THAT SHE CARRIED AND HIS MEMORY CAME BACK AND HE KNEW HER
3717-21498-0036 AND KISSED HER AND DECLARED THAT SHE WAS HIS TRUE WIFE AND THAT HE LOVED HER AND NO OTHER
3994-11512-0000 THIS PART IS RELATED BY PETER HAGSTROM PH D THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE IDEAS FROM ONE INDIVIDUAL TO ANOTHER SAID A PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY TO HIS CLASS IS THE PRINCIPAL DISTINCTION
3994-11512-0001 BETWEEN HUMAN BEINGS AND THEIR BRUTE FORBEARS
3994-11512-0002 BUT UPON TWO YOUNG MEN IN THE CLASS IT MADE A POWERFUL IMPRESSION IT CRYSTALLIZED WITHIN THEM CERTAIN VAGUE CONCEPTIONS AND BROUGHT THEM TO A CONSCIOUS FOCUS ENABLING THE YOUNG MEN TO TURN FORMLESS DREAMS INTO CONCRETE ACTS
3994-11512-0003 THAT IS WHY I TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE ABOVE ENTHUSIASTIC WORDS OF THIS SOCIOLOGY PROFESSOR WHOSE VERY NAME I HAVE FORGOTTEN WERE THE PRIME MOVING INFLUENCE WHICH MANY YEARS LATER SUCCEEDED IN SAVING OCCIDENTAL CIVILIZATION
3994-11512-0004 THAT WE WERE A HIGHLY CIVILIZED PAIR OF YOUNGSTERS
3994-11512-0005 BUT THE PASSING YEARS SAW US ENGAGED IN WIDELY AND CURIOUSLY DIVERGENT PHASES OF THE WORK THIRTY YEARS LATER I WAS PROFESSOR OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND BENDA WAS MAINTENANCE ENGINEER OF THE BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY OF NEW YORK CITY
3994-11512-0006 AND ON HIS KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL DEPENDED THE CONTINUITY AND STABILITY OF THAT STUPENDOUSLY COMPLEX TRAFFIC THE TELEPHONE COMMUNICATION OF GREATER NEW YORK SINCE OUR AMBITIOUS CRAVINGS WERE SATISFIED IN OUR EVERYDAY WORK
3994-11512-0007 WE NO LONGER FELT IMPELLED TO SIGNAL ACROSS THE HOUSE TOPS WITH SEMAPHORES NOR TO DEVISE CIPHERS THAT WOULD DEFY SOLUTION BUT WE STILL KEPT UP OUR INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP AND OUR INTENSE INTEREST IN OUR BELOVED SUBJECT
3994-11512-0008 WE WERE JUST AS CLOSE CHUMS AT THE AGE OF FIFTY AS WE HAD BEEN AT TEN AND JUST AS THRILLED AT NEW ADVANCES IN COMMUNICATION AT TELEVISION AT THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE AT THE SUPPOSED SIGNALS FROM MARS
3994-11512-0009 THIS FOR MANY REASONS WAS A MOST AMAZING PIECE OF NEWS TO MYSELF AND TO ANYONE WHO KNEW BENDA OF COURSE IT WAS COMMONLY KNOWN THAT BENDA WAS BEING SOUGHT BY UNIVERSITIES AND CORPORATIONS
3994-11512-0010 I KNOW PERSONALLY OF SEVERAL TEMPTING OFFERS HE HAD RECEIVED BUT THE NEW YORK BELL IS A WEALTHY CORPORATION AND HAD THUS FAR MANAGED TO HOLD BENDA BOTH BY THE MUNIFICENCE OF ITS SALARY AND BY THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE WORK IT OFFERED HIM
3994-11512-0011 BUT THAT IT COULD OUTBID THE NEW YORK BELL WAS
3994-11512-0012 WELL BALANCED HABITS OF THINKING AND LIVING SUPPORTED BY AN INTELLECT SO CLEAR AND SO KEEN THAT I KNEW OF NONE TO EXCEL IT WHAT THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY WAS NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY BUT
3994-11512-0014 AT THE TIME OF WHICH I NOW SPEAK THE NOVELTY HAD WORN OFF AND NO ONE PAID ANY MORE ATTENTION TO IT THAN THEY DO TO ZION CITY OR THE DUNKARDS BY THIS TIME THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY WAS A CITY OF A MILLION INHABITANTS
3994-11512-0015 AND OF ALL OTHER RESOURCES PROVIDED BY SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS SO MUCH VISITORS AND REPORTERS WERE ABLE TO SAY THE RUMORS THAT IT WAS A VAST SOCIALISTIC ORGANIZATION WITHOUT PRIVATE PROPERTY
3994-11512-0016 WITH EQUAL SHARING OF ALL PRIVILEGES WERE NEVER CONFIRMED IT IS A CURIOUS OBSERVATION THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE IN THIS COUNTRY OF OURS FOR A CITY TO EXIST ABOUT WHICH WE KNEW SO LITTLE HOWEVER IT SEEMED EVIDENT FROM THE VAST NUMBER AND ELABORATION OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS
3994-11512-0017 THE PERFECTION OF COMMUNITY UTILITIES SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION STREETS LIGHTING AND COMMUNICATION FROM THE ABSENCE OF INDIVIDUAL HOMES AND THE HOUSING OF PEOPLE IN HUGE DORMITORIES THAT SOME DIFFERENT LESS INDIVIDUALISTIC TYPE OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION THAN OURS WAS INVOLVED
3994-11512-0018 HE WAS NOT THE TYPE OF MAN TO LEAVE A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR JOB AND JOIN A COMMUNIST CITY ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH THE CLERKS IN THE STORES AS IT HAPPENS I WAS ALSO INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH JOHN EDGEWATER SMITH
3994-11512-0019 RECENTLY POWER COMMISSIONER OF NEW YORK CITY AND THE MOST CAPABLE POWER ENGINEER IN NORTH AMERICA WHO FOLLOWING BENDA BY TWO OR THREE MONTHS RESIGNED HIS POSITION AND ACCEPTED WHAT HIS LETTER TERMED THE PLACE OF DIRECTOR OF POWER IN THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY
3994-11512-0020 I WAS PERSONALLY IN A POSITION TO STATE THAT NEITHER OF THESE MEN COULD BE LIGHTLY PERSUADED INTO SUCH A STEP AND THAT NEITHER OF THEM WOULD WORK FOR A SMALL SALARY BENDA'S FIRST LETTER TO ME STATED THAT HE WAS AT THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY ON A VISIT
3994-11512-0021 HE HAD HEARD OF THE PLACE AND WHILE AT WASHINGTON ON BUSINESS HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE OUT AND SEE IT FASCINATED BY THE EQUIPMENT HE SAW THERE HE HAD DECIDED TO STAY A FEW DAYS AND STUDY IT THE NEXT LETTER ANNOUNCED HIS ACCEPTANCE OF THE POSITION
3994-11512-0022 I WOULD GIVE A MONTH'S SALARY TO GET A LOOK AT THOSE LETTERS NOW BUT I NEGLECTED TO PRESERVE THEM I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM BECAUSE I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER THEY EXHIBIT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SUBSEQUENT LETTERS SOME OF WHICH I NOW HAVE AS I HAVE STATED
3994-11512-0023 BENDA AND I HAD BEEN ON THE MOST INTIMATE TERMS FOR FORTY YEARS HIS LETTERS HAD ALWAYS BEEN CRISP AND DIRECT AND THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR AND CONFIDENTIAL I DO NOT KNOW JUST HOW MANY LETTERS I RECEIVED FROM HIM FROM THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY BEFORE I NOTED THE DIFFERENCE
3994-11512-0024 BUT I HAVE ONE FROM THE THIRD MONTH OF HIS STAY THERE HE WROTE EVERY TWO OR THREE WEEKS CHARACTERIZED BY A VERBOSITY THAT SOUNDED STRANGE FOR HIM
3994-11512-0025 THERE FOLLOWED SEVERAL MONTHS OF LETTERS LIKE THAT A LOT OF WORDS EVASION OF COMING TO THE POINT ABOUT ANYTHING JUST
3994-11512-0026 YET IT WAS BENDA WRITING THEM GRUFF LITTLE EXPRESSIONS OF HIS CLEAR WAYS OF LOOKING AT EVEN THE VERIEST TRIFLES LITTLE ALLUSION TO OUR COMMON PAST THESE THINGS COULD NEITHER HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY ANYONE ELSE NOR WRITTEN UNDER COMPULSION FROM WITHOUT
3994-11512-0027 SOMETHING HAD CHANGED BENDA I PONDERED ON IT A GOOD DEAL AND COULD THINK OF NO HYPOTHESIS TO ACCOUNT FOR IT IN THE MEANWHILE NEW YORK CITY LOST A THIRD TECHNICAL MAN TO THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY
3994-11512-0028 DONALD FRANCISCO COMMISSIONER OF THE WATER SUPPLY A SANITARY ENGINEER OF INTERNATIONAL STANDING ACCEPTED A POSITION IN THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY AS WATER DIRECTOR I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO LAUGH AND COMPARE IT TO THE NATIONAL BASEBALL LEAGUE'S TRAFFICKING IN BIG NAMES
3994-11512-0029 OR TO HUNT FOR SOME SINISTER DANGER SIGN IN IT BUT AS A RESULT OF MY PONDERINGS I DECIDED TO VISIT BENDA AT THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY I WROTE HIM TO THAT EFFECT
3994-11512-0030 AND ALMOST DECIDED TO CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT THE VISIT BECAUSE OF THE COLD EVASIVENESS OF THE REPLY I RECEIVED FROM HIM MY FIRST IMPULSE ON READING HIS INDIFFERENT LACKADAISICAL COMMENT ON MY PROPOSED VISIT WAS TO FEEL OFFENDED AND DETERMINE TO LET HIM ALONE AND NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN
3994-11512-0031 BUT MY LONG YEARS OF TRAINING IN PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION TOLD ME THAT A CHARACTER AND A FRIENDSHIP BUILT DURING FORTY YEARS DOES NOT CHANGE IN SIX MONTHS
3994-11512-0032 I WROTE HIM THAT I WAS COMING I FOUND THAT THE BEST WAY TO REACH THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY WAS TO TAKE A BUS OUT FROM WASHINGTON IT INVOLVED A DRIVE OF ABOUT FIFTY MILES NORTHWEST THROUGH A PICTURESQUE SECTION OF THE COUNTRY
3994-11512-0033 THE CITY OF MY DESTINATION WAS BACK IN THE HILLS AND VERY MUCH ISOLATED DURING THE LAST TEN MILES WE MET NO TRAFFIC AT ALL AND I WAS THE ONLY PASSENGER LEFT IN THE BUS SUDDENLY THE VEHICLE STOPPED
3994-11512-0034 THE DRIVER SAID AS HE TURNED AROUND AND DROVE OFF LEAVING ME STANDING THERE WITH MY BAG VERY MUCH ASTONISHED AT IT ALL HE WAS RIGHT A SMALL NEAT LOOKING BUS DROVE THROUGH THE PASS AND STOPPED FOR ME
3994-11512-0035 AS I GOT IN THE DRIVER MECHANICALLY TURNED AROUND AND DROVE INTO THE HILLS AGAIN THEY TOOK UP MY TICKET ON THE OTHER BUS I SAID TO THE DRIVER
3994-11512-0036 NOTHING HE SAID CURTLY FILL THAT OUT HE HANDED ME A CARD AN IMPERTINENT THING THAT CARD WAS
3994-11512-0037 AND BY THE TIME I WAS THROUGH THE BUS WAS OUT OF THE HILLS TRAVELING UP THE VALLEY OF A SMALL RIVER
3994-149798-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN UNDER THE GREAT DOME WHEN GLINDA THE GOOD AND HER FOLLOWERS OF THE RESCUE EXPEDITION CAME IN SIGHT OF THE ENCHANTED MOUNTAIN OF THE FLATHEADS
3994-149798-0001 IF WE GO TO THE MOUNTAIN SAID THE WIZARD WE MAY GET INTO TROUBLE WITH THAT WICKED SU DIC AND THEN WE WOULD BE DELAYED IN RESCUING OZMA AND DOROTHY SO I THINK OUR BEST PLAN WILL BE TO GO TO THE SKEEZER COUNTRY
3994-149798-0002 RAISE THE SUNKEN ISLAND AND SAVE OUR FRIENDS AND THE IMPRISONED SKEEZERS AFTERWARD WE CAN VISIT THE MOUNTAIN AND PUNISH THE CRUEL MAGICIAN OF THE FLATHEADS THAT IS SENSIBLE APPROVED THE SHAGGY MAN I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU
3994-149798-0003 THESE WERE SET CLOSELY TOGETHER THE BRANCHES WHICH CAME QUITE TO THE GROUND BEING SO TIGHTLY INTERLACED THAT EVEN THE GLASS CAT COULD SCARCELY FIND A PLACE TO SQUEEZE THROUGH THE PATH WHICH THE FLATHEADS USED WAS SOME DISTANCE AWAY
3994-149798-0004 HERE'S A JOB FOR THE TIN WOODMAN SAID THE SCARECROW SO THE TIN WOODMAN WHO WAS ALWAYS GLAD TO BE OF USE SET TO WORK WITH HIS SHARP GLEAMING AXE WHICH HE ALWAYS CARRIED
3994-149798-0005 FAR FROM SHORE AND DIRECTLY IN THE CENTER OF THE LAKE OF COURSE EVERY EYE WAS AT FIRST FIXED UPON THIS DOME WHERE OZMA AND DOROTHY AND THE SKEEZERS WERE STILL FAST PRISONERS BUT SOON THEIR ATTENTION WAS CAUGHT BY A MORE BRILLIANT SIGHT
3994-149798-0006 FOR HERE WAS THE DIAMOND SWAN SWIMMING JUST BEFORE THEM ITS LONG NECK ARCHED PROUDLY THE AMETHYST EYES GLEAMING AND ALL THE DIAMOND SPRINKLED FEATHERS GLISTENING SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE RAYS OF THE SUN THAT SAID GLINDA
3994-149798-0007 I AM SURE COO EE OH IS PUNISHED SAID GLINDA FOR SHE HAS LOST ALL HER MAGIC POWER AND HER GRAND PALACE AND CAN NO LONGER MISRULE THE POOR SKEEZERS
3994-149798-0008 PROPOSED THE WIZARD SO GLINDA BECKONED THE DIAMOND SWAN WHICH SWAM GRACEFULLY TO A POSITION NEAR THEM BEFORE ANYONE COULD SPEAK COO EE OH CALLED TO THEM IN A RASPING VOICE
3994-149798-0009 FOR THE VOICE OF A SWAN IS ALWAYS HARSH AND UNPLEASANT AND SAID WITH MUCH PRIDE
3994-149798-0010 HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES REPLIED THE SCARECROW
3994-149798-0011 DEEDS WHAT DEEDS CAN A SWAN DO BUT SWIM AROUND AND GIVE PLEASURE TO ALL BEHOLDERS SAID THE SPARKLING BIRD HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN YOUR FORMER LIFE HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN YOUR MAGIC AND WITCHCRAFT
3994-149798-0012 INQUIRED THE WIZARD
3994-149798-0013 I WOULDN'T GO BACK TO IT IF I COULD DON'T YOU ADMIRE MY BEAUTY STRANGERS TELL US COO EE OH
3994-149798-0014 SAID GLINDA EARNESTLY IF YOU CAN RECALL ENOUGH OF YOUR WITCHCRAFT TO ENABLE US TO RAISE THE SUNKEN ISLAND TO THE SURFACE OF THE LAKE TELL US THAT AND I'LL GIVE YOU A STRING OF PEARLS TO WEAR AROUND YOUR NECK AND ADD TO YOUR BEAUTY
3994-149798-0015 BUT HOW CAN WE RAISE THE ISLAND
3994-149798-0016 SAID BUTTON BRIGHT THE OLD SWAN IS TOO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HERSELF TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S A FACT AGREED BETSY WITH A SIGH
3994-149798-0017 ADDED THE SCARECROW BUT HOW ASKED UNCLE HENRY IN A GRAVE VOICE FOR HE COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK OF HIS DEAR NIECE DOROTHY BEING OUT THERE UNDER WATER HOW SHALL WE DO IT LEAVE THAT TO GLINDA
3994-149798-0018 IF IT WERE JUST AN ORDINARY SUNKEN ISLAND SAID THE POWERFUL SORCERESS THERE WOULD BE SEVERAL WAYS BY WHICH I MIGHT BRING IT TO THE SURFACE AGAIN BUT THIS IS A MAGIC ISLE
3994-149798-0019 IT OBEYS CERTAIN COMMANDS OF MAGIC AND WILL NOT RESPOND TO ANY OTHER I DO NOT DESPAIR IN THE LEAST BUT IT WILL REQUIRE SOME DEEP STUDY TO SOLVE THIS DIFFICULT PROBLEM
3994-149798-0020 THAT THERE ARE THREE FISHES IN THIS LAKE THAT USED TO BE ADEPTS AT MAGIC AND FROM WHOM COO EE OH STOLE MUCH OF HER KNOWLEDGE
3994-149798-0021 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND OF COURSE THAT HAD GLINDA BEEN AT HOME IN HER CASTLE WHERE THE GREAT BOOK OF RECORDS WAS SHE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT ERVIC THE SKEEZER ALREADY HAD TAKEN THE GOLD AND SILVER AND BRONZE FISHES FROM THE LAKE BUT THAT ACT HAD BEEN RECORDED IN THE BOOK
3994-149798-0022 AFTER GLINDA HAD SET OUT ON THIS JOURNEY SO IT WAS ALL UNKNOWN TO HER I THINK I SEE A BOAT YONDER ON THE SHORE SAID OJO THE MUNCHKIN BOY POINTING TO A PLACE AROUND THE EDGE OF THE LAKE
3994-149798-0023 IT WAS A MERE SHELL OF BLACKENED STEEL WITH A COLLAPSIBLE ROOF THAT WHEN IN POSITION MADE THE SUBMARINE WATERTIGHT BUT AT PRESENT THE ROOF RESTED IN SLOTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MAGIC CRAFT
3994-149798-0024 THERE WERE NO OARS OR SAILS NO MACHINERY TO MAKE THE BOAT GO AND ALTHOUGH GLINDA PROMPTLY REALIZED IT WAS MEANT TO BE OPERATED BY WITCHCRAFT SHE WAS NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THAT SORT OF MAGIC HOWEVER
3994-149798-0025 SAID SHE THE BOAT IS MERELY A BOAT AND I BELIEVE I CAN MAKE IT OBEY A COMMAND OF SORCERY AS WELL AS IT DID THE COMMAND OF WITCHCRAFT
3994-149798-0026 NOT ALL OF US RETURNED THE WIZARD
3994-149798-0027 BUT MOST NOBLE SORCERESS PROVIDED YOU CAN MAKE THE BOAT GO OF WHAT USE WILL IT BE TO US CAN'T WE USE IT
3994-149798-0028 WHAT I AM TRYING TO DISCOVER IS HOW THE BOAT CAME TO BE ON THIS SHORE WHILE THE ISLAND ON WHICH IT BELONGS IS UNDER WATER YONDER DID COO EE OH COME HERE IN THE BOAT TO MEET THE FLATHEADS BEFORE THE ISLAND WAS SUNK OR AFTERWARD
3994-149798-0029 FOR WE ARE IN GREAT TROUBLE AND NEED ASSISTANCE IF YOU BELONG ON THE ISLAND WHY ARE YOU HERE DEMANDED GLINDA SO THEY TOLD HER ALL THE STORY
3994-149798-0030 AND HOW THE BOAT HAD SHOT OUT FROM THE BASEMENT OF THE SUNKEN ISLE OBEYING A MAGIC WORD AND RISEN TO THE SURFACE WHERE IT OPENED AND FLOATED UPON THE WATER THEN FOLLOWED THE ACCOUNT OF HOW THE SU DIC
3994-149798-0031 WHILE THE BOAT IN SOME STRANGE MANNER HAD FLOATED TO THE SHORE AND STRANDED UPON THE BEACH THAT WAS ALL THEY KNEW THEY HAD SEARCHED IN VAIN FOR THREE DAYS FOR ERVIC AS THEIR ISLAND WAS UNDER WATER AND THEY COULD NOT GET BACK TO IT
3994-149798-0032 THE THREE SKEEZERS HAD NO PLACE TO GO AND SO HAD WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE THEIR BOAT FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN BEING QUESTIONED BY GLINDA AND THE WIZARD THEY TOLD ALL THEY KNEW ABOUT OZMA AND DOROTHY
3994-149798-0033 AND DECLARED THE TWO GIRLS WERE STILL IN THE VILLAGE UNDER THE GREAT DOME THEY WERE QUITE SAFE AND WOULD BE WELL CARED FOR BY LADY AUREX NOW THAT THE QUEEN WHO OPPOSED THEM WAS OUT OF THE WAY WHEN THEY HAD GLEANED ALL THE INFORMATION THEY COULD FROM THESE SKEEZERS
3994-149798-0034 THE WIZARD SAID TO GLINDA IF YOU FIND YOU CAN MAKE THIS BOAT OBEY YOUR SORCERY YOU COULD HAVE IT RETURN TO THE ISLAND SUBMERGE ITSELF AND ENTER THE DOOR IN THE BASEMENT FROM WHICH IT CAME BUT I CANNOT SEE THAT OUR GOING TO THE SUNKEN ISLAND WOULD ENABLE OUR FRIENDS TO ESCAPE
3994-149798-0035 BUT WHAT COULD THEY DO THEN INQUIRED ANOTHER SKEEZER THEY WOULD HAVE NO HOMES AND NO PLACE TO GO AND WOULD BE AT THE MERCY OF THEIR ENEMIES THE FLATHEADS THAT IS TRUE SAID GLINDA THE GOOD
3994-149798-0036 I THINK SHE WOULD REFUSE TO ESCAPE WITH DOROTHY AND LEAVE THE OTHERS BEHIND OR TO ABANDON THE ISLAND WHICH IS THE LAWFUL HOME OF THE SKEEZERS I BELIEVE THE BEST PLAN WILL BE TO SUMMON THE THREE FISHES AND LEARN FROM THEM HOW TO RAISE THE ISLAND
3994-156757-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY NINE GREAT SMALLPOX EPIDEMIC SAINT MARY'S HALL THANKSGIVING DAY IN CALIFORNIA ANOTHER BROTHER IN LAW MISSUS BRUNNER HAS BECOME TOO CHILDISH TO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF YOUNG GIRLS
3994-156757-0001 HAD BEEN FREQUENTLY REMARKED BEFORE ELITHA'S VISIT AND AFTER HER DEPARTURE THE SAME FRIENDS EXPRESSED REGRET THAT SHE HAD NOT TAKEN US AWAY WITH HER THESE WHISPERED COMMENTS WHICH DID NOT IMPROVE OUR SITUATION SUDDENLY CEASED FOR THE SMALLPOX MADE ITS APPEARANCE IN SONOMA
3994-156757-0002 AND HELPERS WERE NEEDED TO CARE FOR THE AFFLICTED GRANDMA HAD HAD THE DISEASE IN INFANCY AND COULD GO AMONG THE PATIENTS WITHOUT FEAR IN FACT SHE HAD SUCH CONFIDENCE IN HER METHOD OF TREATING IT
3994-156757-0003 THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GEORGIA AND ME VACCINATED WHILE THE EPIDEMIC PREVAILED INSISTING THAT IF WE SHOULD TAKE THE DISEASE SHE COULD NURSE US THROUGH IT WITHOUT DISFIGUREMENT AND WE WOULD THENCEFORTH BE IMMUNE SHE DID NOT EXPOSE US DURING WHAT SHE TERMED THE CATCHING STAGE
3994-156757-0004 BUT AFTER THAT HAD PASSED SHE CALLED US TO SHARE HER WORK AND BECOME FAMILIAR WITH ITS DETAILS AND TAUGHT US HOW TO BREW THE TEAS MAKE THE OINTMENTS AND APPLY THEM I DO NOT REMEMBER A DEATH AMONG HER PATIENTS
3994-156757-0005 ONE WAS OUR PRETTY MISS SALLIE LEWIS WHO HAD THE DREAD DISEASE IN CONFLUENT FORM GRANDMA WAS CALLED HURRIEDLY IN THE NIGHT BECAUSE THE AFFLICTED GIRL IN DELIRIUM HAD LOOSENED THE STRAPS WHICH HELD HER UPON HER BED
3994-156757-0006 BUT COULD NOT KEEP THE CRUEL IMPRINTS FROM HER FACE THE OTHER WAS OUR ARCH ENEMY CASTLE WHO SEEMED SO NEAR DEATH THAT ONE NIGHT AS GRANDMA WAS PEERING INTO THE DARKNESS FOR SIGNAL LIGHTS FROM THE HOMES OF THE SICK
3994-156757-0007 SHE EXCLAIMED IMPULSIVELY HARK CHILDREN THERE GOES THE CATHOLIC BELL COUNT ITS STROKES CASTLE IS A CATHOLIC AND WAS VERY LOW WHEN I SAW HIM TO DAY TOGETHER WE SLOWLY COUNTED THE KNELLS UNTIL SHE STOPPED US SAYING IT'S FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
3994-156757-0008 CASTLE IS NOT SO OLD SHE WAS RIGHT LATER HE CAME TO US TO RECUPERATE AND WAS THE MOST EXACTING AND PROFANE MAN WE EVER WAITED ON HE CONCEIVED A SPECIAL GRUDGE AGAINST GEORGIA
3994-156757-0009 DECLARING THAT SHE HATED CASTLE AND WOULD NOT BE SORRY IF SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO SPOIL HIS FINE NOSE SO WHEN HE CAME TO US FROM THE SICK ROOM SOURED AND CRESTFALLEN BECAUSE DISEASE HAD DEEPLY PITTED AND SEAMED THAT FEATURE WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN HIS PRIDE SHE LAUGHINGLY WHISPERED
3994-156757-0010 WELL I DON'T CARE MY NOSE COULD NEVER LOOK LIKE HIS EVEN IF I HAD THE SMALLPOX FOR THERE IS NOT SO MUCH OF IT TO SPOIL OUR DISLIKE OF THE MAN BECAME INTENSE AND LATER WHEN WE DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS TO BE BARTENDER AT GRANDPA'S BAR AND BOARD AT OUR HOUSE
3994-156757-0011 THIS WAS MORE SATISFACTION TO GEORGIA THAN TO ME FOR SHE HAD THE PLEASURE OF DECLARING THAT IF GRANDMA TOOK THAT MAN TO BOARD SHE WOULD BE A SCHWEITZER CHILD NO LONGER
3994-156757-0012 MAKE HER CLOTHES LIKE AMERICAN CHILDREN'S AND THAT SHE KNEW HER FRIEND MISSUS BERGWALD WOULD GIVE HER A HOME IF GRANDMA SHOULD SEND HER AWAY HERE THE MEETING WAS SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED BY THE DISCOVERY THAT GRANDMA WAS STANDING BEHIND US
3994-156757-0013 I FELT THAT I HAD OUTGROWN SUCH CORRECTION NOR HAD I DESERVED IT AND I TOLD HER THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER NEVER STRIKE ME AGAIN THEN I WALKED TO THE HOUSE ALONE A FEW MOMENTS LATER
3994-156757-0014 GEORGIA CAME UP TO OUR ROOM AND FOUND ME DRESSING MYSELF WITH GREATEST CARE IN AMAZEMENT SHE ASKED ELIZA WHERE ARE YOU GOING AND WAS DUMBFOUNDED WHEN I ANSWERED TO FIND ANOTHER HOME FOR US IN THE LOWER HALL I ENCOUNTERED GRANDMA
3994-156757-0015 WHOSE ANGER HAD COOLED AND SHE ASKED THE QUESTION GEORGIA HAD I RAISED MY SLEEVE SHOWED THE WELT ON MY ARM AND REPLIED I AM GOING TO SEE IF I CAN'T FIND A HOME WHERE THEY WILL TREAT ME KINDLY POOR GRANDMA WAS CONSCIENCE STRICKEN
3994-156757-0016 DREW ME INTO HER OWN ROOM AND DID NOT LET ME LEAVE IT UNTIL AFTER SHE HAD SOOTHED MY HURTS AND WE HAD BECOME FRIENDS AGAIN GEORGIA WENT TO MISSUS BERGWALD'S AND REMAINED QUITE A WHILE WHEN SHE CAME BACK SPEAKING ENGLISH AND INSISTING THAT SHE WAS AN AMERICAN
3994-156757-0017 GRANDMA BECAME VERY ANGRY AND THREATENED TO SEND HER AWAY AMONG STRANGERS THEN HESITATED AS IF REALIZING HOW FULLY GEORGIA BELONGED TO ME AND I TO HER AND THAT WE WOULD CLING TOGETHER WHATEVER MIGHT HAPPEN
3994-156757-0018 IN HER PERPLEXITY SHE BESOUGHT MISSUS BERGWALD'S ADVICE NOW MISSUS BERGWALD WAS A NATIVE OF STOCKHOLM A LADY OF RARE CULTURE AND USED THE FRENCH LANGUAGE IN CONVERSING WITH GRANDMA
3994-156757-0019 SHE SPOKE FEELINGLY OF MY LITTLE SISTER
3994-156757-0020 ANXIOUS TO LEARN THE NICER WAYS OF WORK AND LADYLIKE ACCOMPLISHMENTS SHE COULD SEE NO HARM IN GEORGIA WISHING TO REMAIN AN AMERICAN SINCE TO LOVE ONE'S OWN PEOPLE AND COUNTRY WAS NATURAL THEREAFTER GRANDMA CHANGED HER METHODS
3994-156757-0021 SOMETIMES SHE WOULD LET US BRING HER FROM UNDER THE SOFA HER GORGEOUS PRINTS ILLUSTRATING WILHELM TELL AND WOULD REPEAT THE TEXT RELATING TO THE SCENES AS WE EXAMINED EACH PICTURE WITH EAGER INTEREST
3994-156757-0022 WE WERE ALSO ALLOWED TO GO TO SUNDAY SCHOOL OFTENER AND LATER SHE SENT ME PART OF THE TERM TO THE SELECT SCHOOL FOR GIRLS RECENTLY ESTABLISHED BY DOCTOR VER MEHR AN EPISCOPALIAN CLERGYMAN IN FACT
3994-156757-0023 YET THAT DID NOT LESSEN MY ENTHUSIASM I WAS EAGER FOR KNOWLEDGE I ALSO EXPECTED TO MEET FAMILIAR FACES IN THAT GREAT BUILDING WHICH HAD BEEN THE HOME OF MISTER JACOB LEESE BUT UPON ENTERING
3994-156757-0024 I SAW ONLY FINELY DRESSED YOUNG LADIES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE PROMENADING IN THE HALLS AND SMALL GIRLS FLITTING ABOUT IN THE YARD LIKE BRIGHT WINGED BUTTERFLIES SOME HAD RECEIVED LETTERS FROM HOME AND WERE CALLING OUT THE NEWS OTHERS WERE ENGAGED IN GAMES THAT WERE STRANGE TO ME
3994-156757-0025 THE BELL RANG I FOLLOWED TO THE RECITATION HALL AND WAS ASSIGNED A SEAT BELOW THE REST BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY SMALL SONOMA GIRL YET ENROLLED I MADE SEVERAL LIFE LONG FRIENDS AT THAT INSTITUTE
3994-156757-0026 STILL IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT SAINT MARY'S HALL WAS ESTABLISHED FOR PUPILS WHO HAD BEEN REARED IN THE LAP OF WEALTH AND EASE NOT FOR THOSE WHOSE HANDS WERE ROUGH LIKE MINE NOR WAS THERE A CLASS FOR ME
3994-156757-0027 GRANDMA BELIEVING THAT I HAD GONE TO SCHOOL LONG ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO FINISH MY STUDIES WITHOUT TEACHERS GEORGIA WAS MORE FORTUNATE WHEN MISS HUTCHINSON OPENED THE YOUNG LADIES SEMINARY IN THE FALL
3994-156757-0028 GRANDMA DECIDED TO LEND IT A HELPING HAND BY SENDING HER A TERM AS A DAY SCHOLAR MY DELIGHTED SISTER WAS SOON IN TOUCH WITH A CROWD OF OTHER LITTLE GIRLS AND BROUGHT HOME MANY OF THEIR BRIGHT SAYINGS FOR MY EDIFICATION
3994-156757-0029 AND I AM TO GO AND YOU ALSO AS HER GUEST GRANDMA WAS PLEASED THAT I WAS INVITED AND DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD SEND A LIBERAL DONATION OF MILK AND CHEESE AS A MARK OF APPRECIATION I CAUGHT MUCH OF GEORGIA'S SPIRIT OF DELIGHT
3994-156757-0030 FOR I HAD A VIVID RECOLLECTION OF THE GRAND DINNER GIVEN IN COMMEMORATION OF OUR VERY FIRST LEGALLY APPOINTED THANKSGIVING DAY IN CALIFORNIA I HAD ONLY TO CLOSE MY EYES AND IN THOUGHT WOULD REAPPEAR THE LONGEST AND MOST BOUNTIFULLY SPREAD TABLE I HAD EVER SEEN
3994-156757-0031 TURKEY CHICKEN AND WILD DUCK AT THE ENDS A WHOLE ROASTED PIG IN THE CENTRE AND MORE THAN ENOUGH DELICIOUS ACCOMPANIMENTS TO COVER THE SPACES BETWEEN THEN THE GROWN FOLK DINING FIRST AND THE FLOCK OF HUNGRY CHILDREN COMING LATER
3994-156757-0032 THE SPEAKING LAUGHING AND CLAPPING OF HANDS WITH WHICH THE OLD HOME CUSTOMS WERE INTRODUCED IN THE NEW LAND THERE I WORE A DARK CALICO DRESS AND SUN BONNET
3994-156757-0033 BOTH MADE BY POOR MISSUS MC CUTCHEN OF THE DONNER PARTY WHO HAD TO TAKE IN SEWING FOR A LIVELIHOOD BUT TO THE SEMINARY I SHOULD WEAR GRANDPA'S GIFT A COSTLY ALPACA CHANGEABLE IN THE SUNLIGHT TO SOFT MINGLING BLUISH AND GREENISH COLORS OF THE PEACOCK
3994-156757-0034 ITS WIDE SKIRT REACHED TO MY SHOETOPS AND THE GATHERS TO ITS FULL WAIST WERE GAUGED TO A SHARP PEAK IN FRONT A WIDE OPEN V FROM THE SHOULDER DOWN TO THE PEAK DISPLAYED AN EMBROIDERED WHITE SWISS CHEMISETTE
3994-156757-0035 THE SLEEVES SMALL AT THE WRIST WERE TRIMMED WITH FOLDS OF THE MATERIAL AND A QUILLING OF WHITE LACE AT THE HAND ON THE ALL IMPORTANT MORNING GRANDMA WAS ANXIOUS THAT I SHOULD LOOK WELL
3994-156757-0036 AND QUILLED A SOFT WHITE RUCHING AROUND THE FACE WHICH EMPHASIZED THE FRENCHY STYLE AND FINISH SO PLEASING TO GRANDMA DID I LOOK OLD FASHIONED YES FOR GRANDMA SAID THOU ART LIKE A PICTURE I SAW SOMEWHERE LONG AGO
3994-156757-0037 THEN SHE CONTINUED BRIGHTLY HERE ARE THY MITS AND THY LITTLE EMBROIDERED HANDKERCHIEF FOLDED IN A SQUARE
3994-156757-0038 AND COME NOT BACK LATE FOR MILKING THE SEMINARY PLAYGROUND WAS SO NOISY WITH CHATTER AND SCREAMS OF JOY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE GAMES WE PLAYED AND LATER THE DINING ROOM AND ITS OFFERINGS WERE SO SURPRISING AND SO BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED
3994-156757-0039 THAT THE SIGHT NEARLY DEPRIVED ME OF MY APPETITE MUMPS BITE A PICKLE AND SEE IF IT AIN'T SO EXCLAIMED A NEIGHBOR TO WHOM GEORGIA WAS SHOWING HER PAINFUL AND SWOLLEN FACE TRUE ENOUGH THE LEAST TASTE OF ANYTHING SOUR PRODUCED THE TELL TALE SHOCK
3994-156757-0040 AND WE HAD A HURRIED LITTLE TALK WITH A CLOSED WINDOW BETWEEN US AND WERE FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY OUR TALL BROTHER BEN WHO HAD VERY BLUE EYES AND SOFT BROWN HAIR HE WAS THE SECOND OF THE THREE WILDER BROTHERS
3994-156757-0041 WHO HAD BEEN AMONG THE EARLY GOLD SEEKERS AND TRIED ROUGHING IT IN THE MINES THOUGH A NATIVE OF RHODE ISLAND AND OF PURITAN ANCESTRY HE WAS QUITE WESTERN IN APPEARANCE THOUGH NOT A WEALTHY MAN
4010-10798-0000 THE HEART WITH THE TREASURE
4010-10798-0001 LAY NOT UP FOR YOURSELVES TREASURES UPON EARTH WHERE MOTH AND RUST DOTH CORRUPT AND WHERE THIEVES BREAK THROUGH AND STEAL BUT LAY UP FOR YOURSELVES TREASURES IN HEAVEN WHERE NEITHER MOTH NOR RUST DOTH CORRUPT
4010-10798-0002 AND WHERE THIEVES DO NOT BREAK THROUGH NOR STEAL FOR WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS THERE WILL YOUR HEART BE ALSO
4010-10798-0003 TO UNDERSTAND THE WORDS OF OUR LORD IS THE BUSINESS OF LIFE FOR IT IS THE MAIN ROAD TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD HIMSELF AND TO RECEIVE HIM
4010-10798-0004 IS TO RECEIVE THE FATHER AND SO TO HAVE LIFE IN OURSELVES AND LIFE THE HIGHER THE DEEPER THE SIMPLER
4010-10798-0005 IS THE BUSINESS OF LIFE THE WORD IS THAT BY WHICH WE LIVE NAMELY JESUS HIMSELF
4010-10798-0006 IN SHADOW IN SUGGESTION HIMSELF ANY UTTERANCE WORTHY OF BEING CALLED A TRUTH IS HUMAN FOOD HOW MUCH MORE THE WORD PRESENTING NO ABSTRACT LAWS OF OUR BEING
4010-10798-0007 BUT THE VITAL RELATION OF SOUL AND BODY HEART AND WILL STRENGTH AND REJOICING BEAUTY AND LIGHT TO HIM WHO FIRST GAVE BIRTH TO THEM ALL THE SON CAME FORTH TO BE
4010-10798-0008 BEFORE OUR EYES AND IN OUR HEARTS THAT WHICH HE HAD MADE US FOR THAT WE MIGHT BEHOLD THE TRUTH IN HIM AND CRY OUT FOR THE LIVING GOD WHO IN THE HIGHEST SENSE OF ALL IS THE TRUTH
4010-10798-0009 NOT AS UNDERSTOOD BUT AS UNDERSTANDING LIVING AND BEING DOING AND CREATING THE TRUTH I AM THE TRUTH SAID OUR LORD
4010-10798-0010 AND BY THOSE WHO ARE IN SOME MEASURE LIKE HIM IN BEING THE TRUTH THE WORD CAN BE UNDERSTOOD LET US TRY TO UNDERSTAND HIM SOMETIMES NO DOUBT THE SAVIOUR WOULD HAVE SPOKEN AFTER A DIFFERENT FASHION OF SPEECH
4010-10798-0011 IF HE HAD COME TO ENGLISHMEN INSTEAD OF TO JEWS BUT THE LESSONS HE GAVE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME FOR EVEN WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT A MATTER FOR ITS PASSING IMPORT HIS REPLY CONTAINED THE ENUNCIATION OF THE GREAT HUMAN PRINCIPLE WHICH LAY IN IT
4010-10798-0012 AND THAT LIES CHANGELESS IN EVERY VARIATION OF CHANGEFUL CIRCUMSTANCE WITH THE LIGHT OF ADDED AGES OF CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE IT OUGHT TO BE EASIER FOR US TO UNDERSTAND HIS WORDS
4010-10798-0013 BECAUSE OF ITS DEPTH AT ONCE AND ITS SIMPLICITY BUT IT IS SO COMPLETE SO IMAGINATIVELY COMPREHENSIVE SO IMMEDIATELY OPERATIVE ON THE CONSCIENCE THROUGH ITS POETIC SUGGESTIVENESS
4010-10798-0014 THAT WHEN IT IS ONCE UNDERSTOOD THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID BUT EVERYTHING TO BE DONE WHY NOT LAY UP FOR OURSELVES TREASURES UPON EARTH BECAUSE THERE THE MOTH AND RUST
4010-10798-0015 AND THE THIEF COME AND SO WE SHOULD LOSE THOSE TREASURES YES BY THE MOTH AND THE RUST AND THE THIEF
4010-10798-0016 FOR WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS THERE WILL YOUR HEART BE ALSO OF COURSE THE HEART WILL BE WHERE THE TREASURE IS BUT WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH THE ARGUMENT THIS
4010-10798-0017 THAT WHAT IS WITH THE TREASURE MUST FARE AS THE TREASURE THAT THE HEART WHICH HAUNTS THE TREASURE HOUSE WHERE THE MOTH AND RUST CORRUPT WILL BE EXPOSED TO THE SAME RAVAGES AS THE TREASURE
4010-10798-0018 WILL ITSELF BE RUSTED AND MOTH EATEN MANY A MAN MANY A WOMAN FAIR AND FLOURISHING TO SEE IS GOING ABOUT WITH A RUSTY MOTH EATEN HEART WITHIN THAT FORM OF STRENGTH OR BEAUTY
4010-10798-0019 BUT THIS IS ONLY A FIGURE TRUE BUT IS THE REALITY INTENDED LESS OR MORE THAN THE FIGURE DOES NOT THE RUST AND THE MOTH MEAN MORE THAN DISEASE
4010-10798-0020 BUT BLESSEDNESS YEA ECSTASY A HEART WHICH IS THE INMOST CHAMBER WHEREIN SPRINGS THE DIVINE FOUNTAIN OF YOUR BEING A HEART WHICH GOD REGARDS THOUGH YOU MAY NEVER HAVE KNOWN ITS EXISTENCE
4010-10798-0021 NOT EVEN WHEN ITS WRITHINGS UNDER THE GNAWING OF THE MOTH AND THE SLOW FIRE OF THE RUST HAVE COMMUNICATED A DULL PAIN TO THAT OUTER HEART WHICH SENDS THE BLOOD TO ITS APPOINTED COURSE THROUGH YOUR BODY IF GOD SEES THAT HEART CORRODED
4010-10798-0022 WITH THE RUST OF CARES RIDDLED INTO CAVERNS AND FILMS BY THE WORMS OF AMBITION AND GREED THEN YOUR HEART IS AS GOD SEES IT FOR GOD SEES THINGS AS THEY ARE AND ONE DAY
4010-10798-0023 YOU WILL BE COMPELLED TO SEE NAY TO FEEL YOUR HEART AS GOD SEES IT AND TO KNOW THAT THE CANKERED THING WHICH YOU HAVE WITHIN YOU
4010-10798-0024 IS INDEED THE CENTRE OF YOUR BEING YOUR VERY HEART NOR DOES THE LESSON APPLY TO THOSE ONLY WHO WORSHIP MAMMON WHO GIVE THEIR LIVES THEIR BEST ENERGIES TO THE ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH
4010-10798-0025 BY TASTE BY INTELLECT BY POWER BY ART BY GENIUS OF ANY KIND AND SO WOULD GATHER GOLDEN OPINIONS TO BE TREASURED IN A STOREHOUSE OF EARTH NOR TO SUCH ONLY
4010-10798-0026 DO THESE WORDS BEAR TERRIBLE WARNING FOR THE HURT LIES NOT IN THIS THAT THESE PLEASURES ARE FALSE LIKE THE DECEPTIONS OF MAGIC FOR SUCH THEY ARE NOT PLEASURES THEY ARE NOR YET IN THIS
4010-10798-0027 THAT THEY PASS AWAY AND LEAVE A FIERCE DISAPPOINTMENT BEHIND THAT IS ONLY SO MUCH THE BETTER
4010-10798-0028 THAT THE IMMORTAL THE INFINITE CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF THE EVERLASTING GOD IS HOUSED WITH THE FADING AND THE CORRUPTING AND CLINGS TO THEM AS ITS GOOD CLINGS TO THEM
4010-10798-0029 TILL IT IS INFECTED AND INTERPENETRATED WITH THEIR PROPER DISEASES WHICH ASSUME IN IT A FORM MORE TERRIBLE IN PROPORTION TO THE SUPERIORITY OF ITS KIND THAT WHICH IS MERE DECAY IN THE ONE BECOMING MORAL VILENESS IN THE OTHER
4010-10798-0030 THAT WHICH FITS THE ONE FOR THE DUNGHILL
4010-10798-0031 AND STRENGTHENING THEM IN FURTHER AND FURTHER FLIGHTS TILL AT LAST THEY SHOULD BECOME STRONG TO BEAR THE GOD BORN INTO THE PRESENCE OF ITS FATHER IN HEAVEN THEREIN LIES THE HURT
4010-10798-0032 HE WHOSE HEART IS SOUND BECAUSE IT HAUNTS THE TREASURE HOUSE OF HEAVEN MAY BE TEMPTED OF THE DEVIL
4010-10801-0000 THEY BOTH ALONG WITH SAINT LUKE TELL US OF A CRY WITH A LOUD VOICE AND THE GIVING UP OF THE GHOST BETWEEN WHICH CRY AND THE GIVING UP SAINT LUKE RECORDS THE WORDS FATHER INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SPIRIT
4010-10801-0002 WAS IT THE CRY OF RELIEF AT THE TOUCH OF DEATH WAS IT THE CRY OF VICTORY WAS IT THE CRY OF GLADNESS THAT HE HAD ENDURED TO THE END OR DID THE FATHER LOOK OUT UPON HIM IN ANSWER TO HIS MY GOD
4010-10801-0003 AND THE BLESSEDNESS OF IT MAKE HIM CRY ALOUD BECAUSE HE COULD NOT SMILE WAS SUCH HIS CONDITION NOW THAT THE GREATEST GLADNESS OF THE UNIVERSE COULD EXPRESS ITSELF ONLY IN A LOUD CRY OR WAS IT BUT THE LAST WRENCH OF PAIN
4010-10801-0004 ERE THE FINAL REPOSE BEGAN IT MAY HAVE BEEN ALL IN ONE BUT NEVER SURELY IN ALL BOOKS IN ALL WORDS OF THINKING MEN
4010-10801-0005 CAN THERE BE SO MUCH EXPRESSED AS LAY UNARTICULATED IN THAT CRY OF THE SON OF GOD NOW HAD HE MADE HIS FATHER LORD NO LONGER IN THE MIGHT OF MAKING AND LOVING ALONE BUT LORD IN RIGHT OF DEVOTION AND DEED OF LOVE
4010-10801-0006 NOW SHOULD INWARD SONSHIP AND THE SPIRIT OF GLAD SACRIFICE BE BORN IN THE HEARTS OF MEN FOR THE DIVINE OBEDIENCE WAS PERFECTED BY SUFFERING HE HAD BEEN AMONGST HIS BRETHREN WHAT HE WOULD HAVE HIS BRETHREN BE
4010-10801-0007 HIS VERY LIFE BEING HIS ESSENCE OF EXISTENCE WHAT BEST HE LOVED WHAT BEST HE WAS HE HAD BEEN AMONG THEM THEIR GOD BROTHER AND THE MIGHTY STORY ENDS WITH A CRY
4010-10801-0008 THEN THE CRY MEANT IT IS FINISHED THE CRY MEANT FATHER INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SPIRIT EVERY HIGHEST HUMAN ACT IS JUST A GIVING BACK TO GOD
4010-10801-0009 OF THAT WHICH HE FIRST GAVE TO US THOU GOD HAST GIVEN ME HERE AGAIN IS THY GIFT I SEND MY SPIRIT HOME EVERY ACT OF WORSHIP IS A HOLDING UP TO GOD OF WHAT GOD HATH MADE US HERE LORD
4010-10801-0010 LOOK WHAT I HAVE GOT FEEL WITH ME IN WHAT THOU HAST MADE ME IN THIS THY OWN BOUNTY MY BEING I AM THY CHILD AND KNOW NOT HOW TO THANK THEE SAVE BY UPLIFTING THE HEAVE OFFERING OF THE OVERFLOWING OF THY LIFE
4010-10801-0011 AND CALLING ALOUD IT IS THINE IT IS MINE I AM THINE AND THEREFORE I AM MINE THE VAST OPERATIONS OF THE SPIRITUAL AS OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD ARE SIMPLY A TURNING AGAIN TO THE SOURCE
4010-10801-0012 THE LAST ACT OF OUR LORD IN THUS COMMENDING HIS SPIRIT AT THE CLOSE OF HIS LIFE WAS ONLY A SUMMING UP OF WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD BEEN OFFERING THIS SACRIFICE THE SACRIFICE OF HIMSELF
4010-10801-0013 ALL THE YEARS AND IN THUS SACRIFICING HE HAD LIVED THE DIVINE LIFE EVERY MORNING WHEN HE WENT OUT ERE IT WAS DAY EVERY EVENING WHEN HE LINGERED ON THE NIGHT LAPT MOUNTAIN AFTER HIS FRIENDS WERE GONE
4010-10801-0014 HE WAS OFFERING HIMSELF TO HIS FATHER IN THE COMMUNION OF LOVING WORDS OF HIGH THOUGHTS OF SPEECHLESS FEELINGS AND BETWEEN HE TURNED TO DO THE SAME THING IN DEED NAMELY IN LOVING WORD
4010-10801-0015 IN HELPING THOUGHT IN HEALING ACTION TOWARDS HIS FELLOWS FOR THE WAY TO WORSHIP GOD WHILE THE DAYLIGHT LASTS IS TO WORK THE SERVICE OF GOD THE ONLY DIVINE SERVICE
4010-10801-0016 IS THE HELPING OF OUR FELLOWS I DO NOT SEEK TO POINT OUT THIS COMMENDING OF OUR SPIRITS TO THE FATHER AS A DUTY THAT IS TO TURN THE HIGHEST PRIVILEGE WE POSSESS INTO A BURDEN GRIEVOUS TO BE BORNE
4010-10801-0017 FOR THE HUMAN BEING MAY SAY THUS WITH HIMSELF AM I GOING TO SLEEP TO LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS TO BE HELPLESS FOR A TIME THOUGHTLESS DEAD OR MORE AWFUL CONSIDERATION IN THE DREAMS THAT MAY COME
4010-10801-0018 MAY I NOT BE WEAK OF WILL AND SCANT OF CONSCIENCE FATHER INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SPIRIT I GIVE MYSELF BACK TO THEE TAKE ME SOOTHE ME REFRESH ME MAKE ME OVER AGAIN
4010-10801-0019 AM I GOING OUT INTO THE BUSINESS AND TURMOIL OF THE DAY WHERE SO MANY TEMPTATIONS MAY COME TO DO LESS HONOURABLY LESS FAITHFULLY LESS KINDLY LESS DILIGENTLY THAN THE IDEAL MAN WOULD HAVE ME DO FATHER
4010-10801-0020 TO REFUSE A FRIEND'S REQUEST TO URGE A NEIGHBOUR'S CONSCIENCE FATHER INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SPIRIT AM I IN PAIN IS ILLNESS COMING UPON ME TO SHUT OUT THE GLAD VISIONS OF A HEALTHY BRAIN
4010-10801-0021 AND BRING ME SUCH AS ARE TROUBLED AND UNTRUE TAKE MY SPIRIT LORD AND SEE AS THOU ART WONT THAT IT HAS NO MORE TO BEAR THAN IT CAN BEAR AM I GOING TO DIE THOU KNOWEST
4010-10801-0022 FOR OF THE THOUSANDS WHO PASS THROUGH IT EVERY DAY NOT ONE ENLIGHTENS HIS NEIGHBOUR LEFT BEHIND BUT SHALL I NOT LONG WITH AGONY FOR ONE BREATH OF THY AIR AND NOT RECEIVE IT
4010-10801-0023 SHALL I NOT BE TORN ASUNDER WITH DYING I WILL QUESTION NO MORE FATHER INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SPIRIT FOR IT IS THY BUSINESS NOT MINE
4010-10801-0024 IF THY LOVE WHICH IS BETTER THAN LIFE RECEIVE IT THEN SURELY THY TENDERNESS WILL MAKE IT GREAT THUS MAY THE HUMAN BEING SAY WITH HIMSELF THINK BROTHERS THINK
4010-10801-0025 SISTERS WE WALK IN THE AIR OF AN ETERNAL FATHERHOOD EVERY UPLIFTING OF THE HEART IS A LOOKING UP TO THE FATHER GRACIOUSNESS AND TRUTH ARE AROUND ABOVE
4010-10801-0026 BENEATH US YEA IN US WHEN WE ARE LEAST WORTHY THEN MOST TEMPTED HARDEST UNKINDEST LET US YET COMMEND OUR SPIRITS INTO HIS HANDS
4010-10801-0027 AND SHALL WE DARE TO THINK GOD WOULD SEND US AWAY IF WE CAME THUS AND WOULD NOT BE PLEASED THAT WE CAME EVEN IF WE WERE ANGRY AS JONAH WOULD WE NOT LET ALL THE TENDERNESS OF OUR NATURE FLOW FORTH UPON SUCH A CHILD
4010-10801-0028 AND SHALL WE DARE TO THINK THAT IF WE BEING EVIL KNOW HOW TO GIVE GOOD GIFTS TO OUR CHILDREN GOD WILL NOT GIVE US HIS OWN SPIRIT WHEN WE COME TO ASK HIM
4010-10801-0029 SOME GENIAL RAIN DROP ON THE DRY SELFISHNESS SOME GLANCE OF SUNLIGHT ON THE CLOUDY HOPELESSNESS BREAD AT LEAST WILL BE GIVEN AND NOT A STONE WATER AT LEAST WILL BE SURE AND NOT VINEGAR MINGLED WITH GALL
4010-10801-0030 NOR IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN ASK FOR OURSELVES THAT WE MAY NOT ASK FOR ANOTHER WE MAY COMMEND ANY BROTHER ANY SISTER TO THE COMMON FATHERHOOD AND THERE WILL BE MOMENTS WHEN FILLED WITH THAT SPIRIT WHICH IS THE LORD
4010-10801-0031 NOTHING WILL EASE OUR HEARTS OF THEIR LOVE BUT THE COMMENDING OF ALL MEN ALL OUR BROTHERS ALL OUR SISTERS TO THE ONE FATHER NOR SHALL WE EVER KNOW THAT REPOSE IN THE FATHER'S HANDS
4010-10801-0032 THAT REST OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE WHICH THE LORD KNEW WHEN THE AGONY OF DEATH WAS OVER WHEN THE STORM OF THE WORLD DIED AWAY BEHIND HIS RETIRING SPIRIT AND HE ENTERED THE REGIONS WHERE THERE IS ONLY LIFE AND THEREFORE ALL THAT IS NOT MUSIC IS SILENCE
4010-10822-0000 JESUS ANSWERED THOU SAYEST THAT I AM A KING TO THIS END WAS I BORN AND FOR THIS CAUSE CAME I INTO THE WORLD THAT I SHOULD BEAR WITNESS UNTO THE TRUTH
4010-10822-0001 THE RANK AND RULE OF THIS WORLD ARE UNINTERESTING TO HIM HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THEM CALLING HIS DISCIPLES TO FOLLOW HIM AND HIS TWELVE LEGIONS OF ANGELS TO HELP THEM HE MIGHT SOON HAVE DRIVEN THE ROMANS INTO THE ABYSS PILING THEM ON THE HEAP OF NATIONS THEY HAD TUMBLED THERE BEFORE
4010-10822-0002 WHAT EASIER FOR HIM THAN THUS TO HAVE CLEARED THE WAY AND OVER THE TRIBUTARY WORLD REIGNED THE JUST MONARCH THAT WAS THE DREAM OF THE JEWS NEVER SEEN IN ISRAEL OR ELSEWHERE BUT HAUNTING THE HOPES AND LONGINGS OF THE POOR AND THEIR HELPERS
4010-10822-0003 HE MIGHT FROM JERUSALEM HAVE RULED THE WORLD NOT MERELY DISPENSING WHAT MEN CALL JUSTICE BUT COMPELLING ATONEMENT HE DID NOT CARE FOR GOVERNMENT NO SUCH KINGDOM WOULD SERVE THE ENDS OF HIS FATHER IN HEAVEN OR COMFORT HIS OWN SOUL
4010-10822-0004 WHAT WAS PERFECT EMPIRE TO THE SON OF GOD WHILE HE MIGHT TEACH ONE HUMAN BEING TO LOVE HIS NEIGHBOUR AND BE GOOD LIKE HIS FATHER TO BE LOVE HELPER TO ONE HEART FOR ITS JOY AND THE GLORY OF HIS FATHER WAS THE BEGINNING OF TRUE KINGSHIP
4010-10822-0005 THE LORD WOULD RATHER WASH THE FEET OF HIS WEARY BROTHERS THAN BE THE ONE ONLY PERFECT MONARCH THAT EVER RULED IN THE WORLD IT WAS EMPIRE HE REJECTED WHEN HE ORDERED SATAN BEHIND HIM LIKE A DOG TO HIS HEEL GOVERNMENT I REPEAT
4010-10822-0006 WAS TO HIM FLAT STALE UNPROFITABLE WHAT THEN IS THE KINGDOM OVER WHICH THE LORD CARES TO REIGN FOR HE SAYS HE CAME INTO THE WORLD TO BE A KING I ANSWER A KINGDOM OF KINGS
4010-10822-0007 AND NO OTHER WHERE EVERY MAN IS A KING THERE AND THERE ONLY DOES THE LORD CARE TO REIGN IN THE NAME OF HIS FATHER AS NO KING IN EUROPE WOULD CARE TO REIGN OVER A CANNIBAL A SAVAGE OR AN ANIMAL RACE
4010-10822-0008 SO THE LORD CARES FOR NO KINGDOM OVER ANYTHING THIS WORLD CALLS A NATION A KING MUST RULE OVER HIS OWN KIND JESUS IS A KING IN VIRTUE OF NO CONQUEST INHERITANCE OR ELECTION BUT IN RIGHT OF ESSENTIAL BEING
4010-10822-0009 SEE WHEREIN CONSISTS HIS KINGSHIP WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES HIM A KING WHAT MANIFESTATION OF HIS ESSENTIAL BEING GIVES HIM A CLAIM TO BE KING THE LORD'S IS A KINGDOM IN WHICH NO MAN SEEKS TO BE ABOVE ANOTHER
4010-10822-0010 AMBITION IS OF THE DIRT OF THIS WORLD'S KINGDOMS HE SAYS I AM A KING FOR I WAS BORN FOR THE PURPOSE I CAME INTO THE WORLD WITH THE OBJECT OF BEARING WITNESS TO THE TRUTH EVERYONE THAT IS OF MY KIND
4010-10822-0011 AS WOULD MOST CHRISTIANS NOWADAYS INSTEAD OF SETTING ABOUT BEING TRUE REQUESTS A DEFINITION OF TRUTH A PRESENTATION TO HIS INTELLECT IN SET TERMS OF WHAT THE WORD TRUTH MEANS BUT INSTANTLY WHETHER CONFIDENT OF THE USELESSNESS OF THE INQUIRY
4010-10822-0012 OR INTENDING TO RESUME IT WHEN HE HAS SET THE LORD AT LIBERTY GOES OUT TO THE PEOPLE TO TELL THEM HE FINDS NO FAULT IN HIM WHATEVER INTERPRETATION WE PUT ON HIS ACTION HERE HE MUST BE FAR LESS WORTHY OF BLAME THAN THOSE CHRISTIANS WHO
4010-10822-0013 SOME BY CONDEMNING THE OPINIONS OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS SOME BY TEACHING OTHERS WHAT THEY DO NOT THEMSELVES HEED
4010-10822-0014 FIRST OF ALL THAT HIS FATHER IS GOOD PERFECTLY GOOD AND THAT THE CROWN AND JOY OF LIFE IS TO DESIRE AND DO THE WILL OF THE ETERNAL SOURCE OF WILL AND OF ALL LIFE HE DEALS THUS THE DEATH BLOW TO THE POWER OF HELL FOR THE ONE PRINCIPLE OF HELL IS
4010-10822-0015 MY OWN GLORY IS AND OUGHT TO BE MY CHIEF CARE MY AMBITION TO GATHER THE REGARDS OF MEN TO THE ONE CENTRE MYSELF MY PLEASURE IS MY PLEASURE MY KINGDOM IS
4010-10822-0016 AS MANY AS I CAN BRING TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY GREATNESS OVER THEM MY JUDGMENT IS THE FAULTLESS RULE OF THINGS MY RIGHT IS WHAT I DESIRE THE MORE I AM ALL IN ALL TO MYSELF THE GREATER I AM
4010-10822-0017 THE LESS I ACKNOWLEDGE DEBT OR OBLIGATION TO ANOTHER THE MORE I CLOSE MY EYES TO THE FACT THAT I DID NOT MAKE MYSELF THE MORE SELF SUFFICING I FEEL OR IMAGINE MYSELF THE GREATER I AM
4010-10822-0018 I WILL BE FREE WITH THE FREEDOM THAT CONSISTS IN DOING WHATEVER I AM INCLINED TO DO FROM WHATEVER QUARTER MAY COME THE INCLINATION TO DO MY OWN WILL SO LONG AS I FEEL ANYTHING TO BE MY WILL IS TO BE FREE IS TO LIVE
4010-10822-0019 TO ALL THESE PRINCIPLES OF HELL OR OF THIS WORLD THEY ARE THE SAME THING AND IT MATTERS NOTHING WHETHER THEY ARE ASSERTED OR DEFENDED SO LONG AS THEY ARE ACTED UPON THE LORD THE KING GIVES THE DIRECT LIE
4010-10822-0020 FOR I HAVE BEEN FROM ALL ETERNITY THE SON OF HIM FROM WHOM YOU ISSUE AND WHOM YOU CALL YOUR FATHER BUT WHOM YOU WILL NOT HAVE YOUR FATHER I KNOW ALL HE THINKS AND IS AND I SAY THIS THAT MY PERFECT FREEDOM MY PURE INDIVIDUALITY
4010-10822-0021 AND HE WILL HAVE HIS CHILDREN SUCH AS HIMSELF CREATURES OF LOVE OF FAIRNESS OF SELF DEVOTION TO HIM AND THEIR FELLOWS I WAS BORN TO BEAR WITNESS TO THE TRUTH IN MY OWN PERSON TO BE THE TRUTH VISIBLE
4010-10822-0022 SUCH AS I AM HE IS IF I SAID I DID NOT KNOW HIM I SHOULD BE A LIAR I FEAR NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO ME SHALL THE KING WHO COMES TO SAY WHAT IS TRUE TURN HIS BACK FOR FEAR OF MEN MY FATHER IS LIKE ME I KNOW IT
4010-10822-0023 AND I SAY IT YOU DO NOT LIKE TO HEAR IT BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT LIKE HIM I AM LOW IN YOUR EYES WHICH MEASURE THINGS BY THEIR SHOW THEREFORE YOU SAY I BLASPHEME
4010-10822-0024 I SHOULD BLASPHEME IF I SAID HE WAS SUCH AS ANYTHING YOU ARE CAPABLE OF IMAGINING HIM FOR YOU LOVE SHOW AND POWER AND THE PRAISE OF MEN I DO NOT AND GOD IS LIKE ME
4010-10822-0025 I CAME INTO THE WORLD TO SHOW HIM I AM A KING BECAUSE HE SENT ME TO BEAR WITNESS TO HIS TRUTH AND I BEAR IT KILL ME AND I WILL RISE AGAIN YOU CAN KILL ME BUT YOU CANNOT HOLD ME DEAD DEATH IS MY SERVANT
4010-10822-0026 ABLE TO SEE AND WRITE THESE THINGS I SHOULD FAIL OF WITNESSING AND MYSELF BE AFTER ALL A CASTAWAY NO KING BUT A TALKER NO DISCIPLE OF JESUS READY TO GO WITH HIM TO THE DEATH
4010-10822-0027 A HATER OF THE LIES MEN SPEAK FOR GOD AND MYSELF A TRUTH SPEAKING LIAR NOT A DOER OF THE WORD
4010-10822-0028 WE SEE THEN THAT THE LORD BORE HIS WITNESS TO THE TRUTH TO THE ONE GOD BY STANDING JUST WHAT HE WAS BEFORE THE EYES AND THE LIES OF MEN THE TRUE KING IS THE MAN WHO STANDS UP A TRUE MAN
4010-10822-0029 AND SPEAKS THE TRUTH AND WILL DIE BUT NOT LIE THE ROBES OF SUCH A KING MAY BE RAGS OR PURPLE IT MATTERS NEITHER WAY THE RAGS ARE THE MORE LIKELY BUT NEITHER BETTER NOR WORSE THAN THE ROBES
4010-10822-0030 IT MATTERED NOTHING WHICH THEY WITNESSED THE TRUTH IS GOD THE WITNESS TO THE TRUTH IS JESUS THE KINGDOM OF THE TRUTH IS THE HEARTS OF MEN THE BLISS OF MEN IS THE TRUE GOD
4010-10822-0031 THE THOUGHT OF GOD IS THE TRUTH OF EVERYTHING ALL WELL BEING LIES IN TRUE RELATION TO GOD THE MAN WHO RESPONDS TO THIS WITH HIS WHOLE BEING IS OF THE TRUTH THE MAN WHO KNOWS THESE THINGS AND BUT KNOWS THEM
4010-10822-0032 JUDGMENT AND LOVE BY THEM IS OF THE WORST OF LYING WITH HAND AND FOOT AND FACE HE CASTS SCORN UPON THAT WHICH HIS TONGUE CONFESSES
4010-10822-0033 LITTLE THOUGHT THE SONS OF ZEBEDEE AND THEIR AMBITIOUS MOTHER WHAT THE EARTHLY THRONE OF CHRIST'S GLORY WAS WHICH THEY AND SHE BEGGED THEY MIGHT SHARE FOR THE KING CROWNED BY HIS WITNESSING
4010-10822-0034 WITNESSED THEN TO THE HEIGHT OF HIS UTTERMOST ARGUMENT WHEN HE HUNG UPON THE CROSS LIKE A SIN AS PAUL IN HIS BOLDNESS EXPRESSES IT WHEN HIS WITNESS IS TREATED AS A LIE THEN MOST HE WITNESSES FOR HE GIVES IT STILL
4010-10822-0035 HIGH AND LIFTED UP ON THE THRONE OF HIS WITNESS ON THE CROSS OF HIS TORTURE HE HOLDS TO IT I AND THE FATHER ARE ONE EVERY MOCKERY BORNE IN WITNESSING IS A WITNESSING AFRESH
4010-10822-0036 AND PERHAPS MADE HIM SIT ON THE JUDGMENT SEAT IN HIS MOCKERY OF KINGLY GARMENTS AND ROYAL INSIGNIA SAYING BEHOLD YOUR KING JUST BECAUSE OF THOSE ROBES AND THAT CROWN THAT SCEPTRE AND THAT THRONE OF RIDICULE
4010-10822-0037 HE WAS THE ONLY REAL KING THAT EVER SAT ON ANY THRONE IS EVERY CHRISTIAN EXPECTED TO BEAR WITNESS
4010-10822-0038 ONE WHO BELIEVES MUST BEAR WITNESS ONE WHO SEES THE TRUTH MUST LIVE WITNESSING TO IT IS OUR LIFE THEN A WITNESSING TO THE TRUTH
4010-10822-0039 DO WE CARRY OURSELVES IN BANK ON FARM IN HOUSE OR SHOP IN STUDY OR CHAMBER OR WORKSHOP AS THE LORD WOULD OR AS THE LORD WOULD NOT ARE WE CAREFUL TO BE TRUE DO WE ENDEAVOUR TO LIVE TO THE HEIGHT OF OUR IDEAS
4010-10822-0040 OR ARE WE MEAN SELF SERVING WORLD FLATTERING FAWNING SLAVES WHEN CONTEMPT IS CAST ON THE TRUTH DO WE SMILE WRONGED IN OUR PRESENCE DO WE MAKE NO SIGN THAT WE HOLD BY IT
4010-10822-0041 BUT WE ARE CALLED UPON TO SHOW THAT WE ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT WHEN I SAY TRUTH I DO NOT MEAN OPINION TO TREAT OPINION AS IF THAT WERE TRUTH IS GRIEVOUSLY TO WRONG THE TRUTH
4010-10822-0042 THE SOUL THAT LOVES THE TRUTH AND TRIES TO BE TRUE WILL KNOW WHEN TO SPEAK AND WHEN TO BE SILENT BUT THE TRUE MAN WILL NEVER LOOK AS IF HE DID NOT CARE WE ARE NOT BOUND TO SAY ALL WE THINK BUT WE ARE BOUND NOT EVEN TO LOOK WHAT WE DO NOT THINK
4010-10822-0043 THE GIRL WHO SAID BEFORE A COMPANY OF MOCKING COMPANIONS I BELIEVE IN JESUS BORE TRUE WITNESS TO HER MASTER THE TRUTH DAVID BORE WITNESS TO GOD THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAID
4013-11734-0000 CAESAR'S AMBITION WAS ONLY FED BY VICTORIES
4013-11734-0001 BEFORE EXCITED BY THE MARISCOTTI OLD ENEMIES OF THE BENTIVOGLIO FAMILY
4013-11734-0002 BUT GIAN DI BENTIVOGLIO WHOSE ANCESTORS HAD POSSESSED THIS TOWN FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL HAD NOT ONLY MADE ALL PREPARATIONS NECESSARY FOR A LONG RESISTANCE BUT HE HAD ALSO PUT HIMSELF UNDER THE PROTECTION OF FRANCE
4013-11734-0003 SO SCARCELY HAD HE LEARNED THAT CAESAR WAS CROSSING THE FRONTIER OF THE BOLOGNESE TERRITORY WITH HIS ARMY
4013-11734-0004 LOUIS KEPT IT WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED GOOD FAITH AND WHEN CAESAR ARRIVED BEFORE BOLOGNA HE RECEIVED AN INTIMATION FROM THE KING OF FRANCE THAT HE WAS NOT TO ENTER ON ANY UNDERTAKING AGAINST HIS ALLY BENTIVOGLIO CAESAR NOT BEING THE MAN TO HAVE HIS PLANS UPSET FOR NOTHING
4013-11734-0005 MADE CONDITIONS FOR HIS RETREAT TO WHICH BENTIVOGLIO CONSENTED ONLY TOO HAPPY TO BE QUIT OF HIM AT THIS PRICE THE CONDITIONS WERE THE CESSION OF CASTELLO BOLOGNESE A FORTRESS BETWEEN IMOLA AND FAENZA
4013-11734-0006 TO ASSASSINATE WITH HIS OWN HAND AGAMEMNON MARISCOTTI THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY AND ORDERED THE MASSACRE OF FOUR AND THIRTY OF HIS NEAR RELATIVES BROTHERS SONS DAUGHTERS AND NEPHEWS AND TWO HUNDRED OTHER OF HIS KINDRED AND FRIENDS
4013-11734-0007 WHOM BENTIVOGLIO FORCED TO BATHE THEIR HANDS IN THIS BLOOD SO THAT HE MIGHT ATTACH THEM TO HIMSELF THROUGH THEIR FEAR OF REPRISALS CAESAR'S PLANS WITH REGARD TO FLORENCE WERE NOW NO LONGER A MYSTERY SINCE THE MONTH OF JANUARY
4013-11734-0008 UNDER THE COMMAND OF REGNIERO DELLA SASSETTA AND PIERO DI GAMBA CORTI AND AS SOON AS THE CONQUEST OF THE ROMAGNA WAS COMPLETE HE HAD FURTHER DESPATCHED OLIVEROTTO DI FERMO WITH NEW DETACHMENTS
4013-11734-0009 BY A HUNDRED MEN AT ARMS AND TWO THOUSAND INFANTRY HE HAD JUST BEEN JOINED BY VITELLOZZO VITELLI LORD OF CITTA DI CASTELLO AND BY THE ORSINI WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM ANOTHER TWO OR THREE THOUSAND MEN SO WITHOUT COUNTING THE TROOPS SENT TO PISA HE HAD UNDER HIS CONTROL
4013-11734-0010 HE BEGAN TO PUT A PRICE ON THE FRIENDSHIP HE HAD AT FIRST OFFERED FREELY AND TO IMPOSE HIS OWN CONDITIONS INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING THOSE OF OTHERS THESE WERE THAT PIERO DEI MEDICI KINSMAN AND ALLY OF THE ORSINI SHOULD BE REINSTATED IN HIS ANCIENT POWER
4013-11734-0011 THAT SIX FLORENTINE CITIZENS TO BE CHOSEN BY VITELLOZZO SHOULD BE PUT INTO HIS HANDS THAT THEY MIGHT BY THEIR DEATH EXPIATE THAT OF PAOLO VITELLI UNJUSTLY EXECUTED BY THE FLORENTINES THAT THE SIGNORIA SHOULD ENGAGE TO GIVE NO AID TO THE LORD OF PIOMBINO
4013-11734-0012 WHOM CAESAR INTENDED TO DISPOSSESS OF HIS ESTATES WITHOUT DELAY AND FURTHER THAT HE HIMSELF SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO THE SERVICE OF THE REPUBLIC
4013-11734-0013 BUT JUST AS CAESAR HAD REACHED THIS POINT IN HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH FLORENCE
4013-11734-0014 WHICH HE WAS AT LAST IN A POSITION TO UNDERTAKE CAESAR DARED NOT BREAK HIS WORD TO SO POWERFUL AN ALLY HE THEREFORE REPLIED THAT HE WAS AT THE KING'S ORDERS AND AS THE FLORENTINES WERE NOT AWARE THAT HE WAS QUITTING THEM ON COMPULSION
4013-11734-0015 AND IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES OF NEED BUT HURRIED AS HE WAS CAESAR STILL HOPED THAT HE MIGHT FIND TIME TO CONQUER THE TERRITORY OF PIOMBINO AS HE WENT BY AND TAKE THE CAPITAL BY A SINGLE VIGOROUS STROKE
4013-11734-0016 BURNED HIS FODDER FELLED HIS TREES TORN DOWN HIS VINES AND DESTROYED A FEW FOUNTAINS THAT PRODUCED SALUBRIOUS WATERS THIS DID NOT HINDER CAESAR FROM SEIZING IN THE SPACE OF A FEW DAYS SEVERETO SCARLINO THE ISLE OF ELBA AND LA PIANOSA
4013-11734-0017 BUT HE WAS OBLIGED TO STOP SHORT AT THE CASTLE WHICH OPPOSED A SERIOUS RESISTANCE
4013-11734-0018 AND HE RECEIVED A FRESH ORDER TO JOIN IT HE TOOK HIS DEPARTURE THE NEXT DAY LEAVING BEHIND HIM VITELLOZZO AND GIAN PAOLO BAGLIANI TO PROSECUTE THE SIEGE IN HIS ABSENCE
4013-11734-0019 TO THE THRONE OF NAPLES TO THOSE LOUIS HIMSELF HAD THROUGH THE HOUSE OF ANJOU BY THIS TREATY THE TWO KINGS WERE SHARING THEIR CONQUESTS BEFOREHAND LOUIS WOULD BE MASTER OF NAPLES OF THE TOWN OF LAVORE AND THE ABRUZZI AND WOULD BEAR THE TITLE OF KING OF NAPLES AND JERUSALEM
4013-11734-0020 WITH THE TITLE OF DUKE OF THESE PROVINCES BOTH WERE TO RECEIVE THE INVESTITURE FROM THE POPE AND TO HOLD THEM OF HIM THIS PARTITION WAS ALL THE MORE LIKELY TO BE MADE IN FACT BECAUSE FREDERIC SUPPOSING ALL THE TIME THAT FERDINAND WAS HIS GOOD AND FAITHFUL FRIEND WOULD OPEN THE GATES OF HIS TOWNS
4013-11734-0021 ONLY TO RECEIVE INTO HIS FORTRESSES CONQUERORS AND MASTERS INSTEAD OF ALLIES ALL THIS PERHAPS WAS NOT VERY LOYAL CONDUCT ON THE PART OF A KING WHO HAD SO LONG DESIRED AND HAD JUST NOW RECEIVED THE SURNAME OF CATHOLIC BUT IT MATTERED LITTLE TO LOUIS
4013-11734-0022 AND THREE GENOESE CARACKS CARRYING SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED INVADERS AGAINST THIS MIGHTY HOST THE KING OF NAPLES HAD ONLY SEVEN HUNDRED MEN AT ARMS SIX HUNDRED LIGHT HORSE AND SIX THOUSAND INFANTRY UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE COLONNA
4013-11734-0023 WHOM HE HAD TAKEN INTO HIS PAY AFTER THEY WERE EXILED BY THE POPE FROM THE STATES OF THE CHURCH BUT HE WAS COUNTING ON GONSALVO OF CORDOVA
4013-11734-0024 AND TO WHOM HE HAD CONFIDINGLY OPENED ALL HIS FORTRESSES IN CALABRIA BUT THE FEELING OF SAFETY INSPIRED BY FREDERIC'S FAITHLESS ALLY WAS NOT DESTINED TO ENDURE LONG
4013-11734-0025 ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT ROME THE FRENCH AND SPANISH AMBASSADORS PRESENTED TO THE POPE THE TREATY SIGNED AT GRENADA
4013-11734-0026 A TREATY WHICH UP TO THAT TIME HAD BEEN SECRET ALEXANDER FORESEEING THE PROBABLE FUTURE HAD BY THE DEATH OF ALFONSO LOOSENED ALL THE BONDS THAT ATTACHED HIM TO THE HOUSE OF ARAGON AND THEN BEGAN BY MAKING SOME DIFFICULTY ABOUT IT
4013-11734-0027 THAT HIS ALLY FERDINAND HAD DECEIVED HIM AND THAT ALEXANDER HAD PRONOUNCED THE SENTENCE OF HIS DOWNFALL HE UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL WAS LOST BUT HE DID NOT WISH IT TO BE SAID THAT HE HAD ABANDONED HIS KINGDOM WITHOUT EVEN ATTEMPTING TO SAVE IT
4013-11734-0028 SO HE CHARGED HIS TWO NEW CONDOTTIERI FABRIZIO CALONNA AND RANUZIA DI MARCIANO TO CHECK THE FRENCH BEFORE CAPUA WITH THREE HUNDRED MEN AT ARMS SOME LIGHT HORSE AND THREE THOUSAND INFANTRY
4013-11734-0029 HAVING PASSED THE VOLTURNO APPROACHED TO LAY SIEGE TO CAPUA
4013-11734-0030 AND HAD FLED THITHER FROM EVERY SIDE EXPECTING TO FIND PROTECTION BENEATH THE WALLS SO ALTHOUGH BRAVELY REPULSED BY FABRIZIO COLONNA THE FRENCH FROM THE MOMENT OF THEIR FIRST ASSAULT INSPIRED SO GREAT AND BLIND A TERROR THAT EVERYONE BEGAN TO TALK OF OPENING THE GATES
4013-11734-0031 AND IT WAS ONLY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT CALONNA
4013-11734-0032 FROM THE CHECK THE BESIEGERS HAD RECEIVED AND OBTAIN GOOD TERMS OF CAPITULATION
4013-11734-0033 AND HAD JOINED THE FRENCH ARMY WITH SOME OF HIS TROOPS ON THE VERY DAY ON WHICH THE CONFERENCE HAD BEEN ARRANGED FOR TWO DAYS LATER AND A CAPITULATION OF ANY NATURE WOULD ROB HIM OF HIS SHARE OF THE BOOTY AND THE PROMISE OF SUCH PLEASURE AS WOULD COME FROM THE CAPTURE OF A CITY SO RICH AND POPULOUS AS CAPUA
4013-11734-0034 IN A FORTIFIED OUTPOST WAS DISCUSSING THE CONDITIONS OF CAPITULATION WITH THE FRENCH CAPTAINS SUDDENLY GREAT CRIES OF DISTRESS WERE HEARD THESE WERE CAUSED BY BORGIA WHO WITHOUT A WORD TO ANYONE HAD ENTERED THE TOWN WITH HIS FAITHFUL ARMY FROM ROMAGNA
4013-11734-0035 THE FRENCH WHEN THEY SAW THAT THE TOWN WAS HALF TAKEN RUSHED ON THE GATES WITH SUCH IMPETUOSITY THAT THE BESIEGED DID NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES ANY LONGER AND FORCED THEIR WAY INTO CAPUA BY THREE SEPARATE SIDES NOTHING MORE COULD BE DONE THEN TO STOP THE ISSUE
4013-11734-0036 BUTCHERY AND PILLAGE HAD BEGUN AND THE WORK OF DESTRUCTION MUST NEEDS BE COMPLETED IN VAIN DID FABRIZIO COLONNA RANUZIO DI MARCIANO AND DON UGO DI CARDONA ATTEMPT TO MAKE HEAD AGAINST THE FRENCH AND SPANIARDS WITH SUCH MEN AS THEY COULD GET TOGETHER
4013-11734-0037 FABRIZIA COLONNA AND DON UGO WERE MADE PRISONERS RANUZIA WOUNDED BY AN ARROW FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE DUKE OF VALENTINOIS
4013-11734-0038 THE CHURCHES WERE PILLAGED THE CONVENTS OF NUNS FORCED OPEN AND THEN MIGHT BE SEEN THE SPECTACLE OF SOME OF THESE HOLY VIRGINS CASTING THEMSELVES INTO PITS OR INTO THE RIVER TO ESCAPE THE SOLDIERS THREE HUNDRED OF THE NOBLEST LADIES OF THE TOWN TOOK REFUGE IN A TOWER
4013-11734-0039 THE DUKE OF VALENTINOIS BROKE IN THE DOORS CHASED OUT FOR HIMSELF FORTY OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND HANDED OVER THE REST TO HIS ARMY THE PILLAGE CONTINUED FOR THREE DAYS CAPUA ONCE TAKEN
4013-11734-0040 FREDERIC SAW THAT IT WAS USELESS ANY LONGER TO ATTEMPT DEFENCE SO HE SHUT HIMSELF UP IN CASTEL NUOVO AND GAVE PERMISSION TO GAETA AND TO NAPLES TO TREAT WITH THE CONQUEROR
4013-11734-0041 AND NAPLES WITH THE SURRENDER OF THE CASTLE THIS SURRENDER WAS MADE TO D'AUBIGNY BY FREDERIC HIMSELF
4013-11734-0042 JEWELS AND FURNITURE AND THERE REMAIN WITH HIS FAMILY FOR SIX MONTHS SECURE FROM ALL HOSTILE ATTACK THE TERMS OF THIS CAPITULATION WERE FAITHFULLY ADHERED TO ON BOTH SIDES D'AUBIGNY ENTERED NAPLES
4013-11734-0043 AT THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO LASTLY CAESAR THE THIRD SON DIED AT FERRARA BEFORE HE HAD ATTAINED HIS EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY FREDERIC'S DAUGHTER CHARLOTTE MARRIED IN FRANCE NICHOLAS COUNT OF LAVAL GOVERNOR AND ADMIRAL OF BRITTANY
4013-11734-0044 A DAUGHTER WAS BORN OF THIS MARRIAGE ANNE DE LAVAL WHO MARRIED FRANCOIS DE LA TRIMAUILLE THROUGH HER THOSE RIGHTS WERE TRANSMITTED TO THE HOUSE OF LA TRIMOUILLE
4013-11734-0045 WHICH HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO INTERRUPT DURING THIS INTERVAL ALEXANDER HAD BEEN VISITING THE SCENES OF HIS SON'S CONQUESTS AND TRAVERSING ALL THE ROMAGNA WITH LUCREZIA WHO WAS NOW CONSOLED FOR HER HUSBAND'S DEATH
4013-11734-0046 FAVOUR WITH HIS HOLINESS SO WHEN SHE RETURNED TO ROME SHE NO LONGER HAD SEPARATE ROOMS FROM HIM THE RESULT OF THIS RECRUDESCENCE OF AFFECTION WAS THE APPEARANCE OF TWO PONTIFICAL BULLS
4013-11734-0047 CONVERTING THE TOWNS OF NEPI AND SERMONETA INTO DUCHIES ONE WAS BESTOWED ON GIAN BARGIA AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD OF THE POPE WHO WAS NOT THE SON OF EITHER OF HIS MISTRESSES ROSA VANOZZA
4013-11734-0048 SON OF LUCREZIA AND ALFONSO THE LANDS OF THE COLONNA WERE IN APPANAGE TO THE TWO DUCHIES BUT ALEXANDER WAS DREAMING OF YET ANOTHER ADDITION TO HIS FORTUNE
4013-11734-0049 SON OF DUKE HERCULES OF FERRARA IN FAVOUR OF WHICH ALLIANCE
4013-11734-0050 HIS HOLINESS WAS NOW HAVING A RUN OF GOOD FORTUNE AND HE LEARNED ON THE SAME DAY THAT PIOMBINO WAS TAKEN AND THAT DUKE HERCULES HAD GIVEN THE KING OF FRANCE HIS ASSENT TO THE MARRIAGE BOTH OF THESE PIECES OF NEWS WERE GOOD FOR ALEXANDER
4013-11734-0051 BUT THE ONE COULD NOT COMPARE IN IMPORTANCE WITH THE OTHER AND THE INTIMATION THAT LUCREZIA WAS TO MARRY THE HEIR PRESUMPTIVE TO THE DUCHY OF FERRARA WAS RECEIVED WITH A JOY SO GREAT THAT IT SMACKED OF THE HUMBLE BEGINNINGS OF THE BORGIAN HOUSE
4013-11734-0052 THE DUKE OF VALENTINOIS WAS INVITED TO RETURN TO ROME TO TAKE HIS SHARE IN THE FAMILY REJOICING AND ON THE DAY WHEN THE NEWS WAS MADE PUBLIC THE GOVERNOR OF SAINT ANGELO RECEIVED ORDERS THAT CANNON SHOULD BE FIRED EVERY QUARTER OF AN HOUR FROM NOON TO MIDNIGHT
4013-11734-0053 ISSUED FROM THE VATICAN FOLLOWED BY ALL THE NOBILITY OF ROME AND PROCEEDED TO THE CHURCH OF THE MADONNA DEL PAPALO WHERE THE DUKE OF GANDIA AND CARDINAL GIAN BORGIA WERE BURIED
4013-11734-0054 AND IN THE EVENING ACCOMPANIED BY THE SAME CAVALCADE WHICH SHONE THE MORE BRIGHTLY UNDER THE TORCHLIGHT AND BRILLIANT ILLUMINATIONS

4013-11734-0070 FOR THE FULFILMENT OF HIS ORDERS BUT THE MESSENGERS REPORTED THAT THEY GREATLY FEARED
4013-11734-0071 WAS THAT IT WAS IMPROBABLE THAT THE SAME DEMONSTRATIONS OF JOY COULD BE EXPECTED FROM A TOWN PLUNGED IN MOURNING THAT WERE LOOKED FOR FROM IMALA FAENZA AND PESARO
4013-11734-0072 IN THE PROMPT AND EFFICACIOUS FASHION CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM ALONE ONE MORNING THE INHABITANTS OF CESENA AWOKE TO FIND A SCAFFOLD SET UP IN THE SQUARE AND UPON IT THE FOUR QUARTERS OF A MAN HIS HEAD SEVERED FROM THE TRUNK STUCK UP ON THE END OF A PIKE THIS MAN
4013-11734-0073 WAS RAMIRO D'ORCO NO ONE EVER KNEW BY WHOSE HANDS THE SCAFFOLD HAD BEEN RAISED BY NIGHT NOR BY WHAT EXECUTIONERS THE TERRIBLE DEED HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT
4013-11734-0074 WHAT HE THOUGHT OF IT HE REPLIED MAGNIFICENT LORDS I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING CONCERNING THE EXECUTION OF RAMIRO D'ORCO EXCEPT THAT CAESAR BORGIA IS THE PRINCE WHO BEST KNOWS HOW TO MAKE AND UNMAKE MEN ACCORDING TO THEIR DESERTS
4013-11734-0075 NICCOLO MACCHIAVELLI THE DUKE OF VALENTINOIS WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AND THE FUTURE DUCHESS OF FERRARA WAS ADMIRABLY RECEIVED IN EVERY TOWN ALONG HER ROUTE

4013-11734-0077 OF WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT WAS A SERVICE HELD ON THE THIRD SUNDAY IN LENT IN WHICH THE CARDINAL OF COSENZA SANG A MASS AND THE POPE OFFICIATED IN STATE WITH THE DUKE AND THE CARDINALS AFTER THESE SOLEMN FUNCTIONS THE CUSTOMARY PLEASURES FOLLOWED AND THE POPE SUMMONED THE PRETTIEST GIRLS OF THE COUNTRY
4013-11734-0078 AND ORDERED THEM TO DANCE THEIR NATIONAL DANCES BEFORE HIM FOLLOWING ON THESE DANCES CAME FEASTS OF UNHEARD OF MAGNIFICENCE DURING WHICH THE POPE IN THE SIGHT OF ALL MEN COMPLETELY IGNORED LENT AND DID NOT FAST
4013-11734-0079 AND SO TO MAKE THE DUKE OF VALENTINOIS POPULAR WHILE POOR JACOPO D'APPIANO WAS FORGOTTEN
4013-11734-0080 THEN THE ILLUSTRIOUS TRAVELLERS EMBARKED ON THEIR RETURN JOURNEY TO ROME
4013-11734-0081 AND THE POPE NOT WISHING TO PUT IN AT PORTO FERRAJO THEY REMAINED FIVE DAYS ON BOARD THOUGH THEY HAD ONLY TWO DAYS PROVISIONS DURING THE LAST THREE DAYS THE POPE LIVED ON FRIED FISH THAT WERE CAUGHT UNDER GREAT DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY WEATHER
4013-11734-0082 WHERE AT LAST HE ARRIVED AFTER ENCOUNTERING SO VIOLENT A TEMPEST
4013-11734-0083 THE POPE ALONE DID NOT SHOW ONE INSTANT'S FEAR BUT REMAINED ON THE BRIDGE DURING THE STORM SITTING ON HIS ARM CHAIR
4013-11734-0084 WHERE HE LANDED AND AFTER SENDING TO CORNETO TO FETCH HORSES HE REJOINED THE DUKE
4013-182396-0000 WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND STRIPED CHIPMUNK SAT STARING AT A LITTLE RIDGE WHERE THE GRASS WAS RAISED UP HE HAD OFTEN SEEN LITTLE RIDGES LIKE THAT WITHOUT THINKING MUCH ABOUT THEM HE KNEW THAT THEY WERE MADE BY MINER THE MOLE
4013-182396-0001 BUT NOW AS HE LOOKED AT THIS ONE IT SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN MINER THE MOLE MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE IN ALL HIS LIFE WHAT A QUEER WAY OF LIVING THOUGHT STRIPED CHIPMUNK
4013-182396-0002 IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO HAVE A SNUG HOUSE UNDER THE GROUND WHERE ONE CAN SLEEP THE LONG COLD WINTER AWAY AND BE PERFECTLY SAFE
4013-182396-0003 IN THE BEAUTIFUL SPRINGTIME AND SUMMERTIME AND AUTUMNTIME I CAN'T UNDERSTAND JUST THINK OF ALL THAT MINER MISSES THE SUNSHINE THE FLOWERS THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS AND THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES TO PLAY WITH I WONDER
4013-182396-0004 WHAT DO YOU WONDER THE VOICE WAS SO CLOSE TO STRIPED CHIPMUNK THAT IT MADE HIM JUMP HE WHIRLED ABOUT THERE WAS JOHNNY CHUCK WHO HAD TIPTOED UP AS SOFTLY AS HE KNEW HOW TO GIVE STRIPED CHIPMUNK A SCARE JOHNNY GRINNED
4013-182396-0005 WHAT DO YOU WONDER HE REPEATED STRIPED CHIPMUNK MADE A FACE AT JOHNNY I WONDER SOMETHING THAT I BET YOU DON'T KNOW HE REPLIED THAT'S EASY REPLIED JOHNNY THERE ARE MORE THINGS I DON'T KNOW THAN I DO KNOW
4013-182396-0006 BUT I'M ALWAYS READY TO LEARN WHAT IS IT THIS TIME WHY DOES MINER THE MOLE LIVE UNDER GROUND ALL THE TIME STRIPED CHIPMUNK POINTED TO THE RIDGE MADE BY MINER JOHNNY CHUCK SCRATCHED HIS HEAD THOUGHTFULLY
4013-182396-0007 I DON'T KNOW HE CONFESSED FINALLY I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE OF COURSE THERE MUST BE A REASON HE NEVER COMES OUT TO PLAY WITH THE REST OF US JUST SPENDS ALL HIS TIME BY HIMSELF DOWN IN THE DARK DIGGING AND DIGGING I WONDER
4013-182396-0008 WELL WHAT DO YOU WONDER THE SAME THING YOU WONDER LAUGHED JOHNNY CHUCK IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING ELSE TO DO LET'S GO DOWN TO THE SMILING POOL AND ASK GRANDFATHER FROG HE'LL BE SURE TO KNOW
4013-182396-0009 STRIPED CHIPMUNK HADN'T ANYTHING ELSE TO DO SO OFF THEY STARTED ON THE WAY THEY MET JIMMY SKUNK AND DANNY MEADOW MOUSE NEITHER OF THEM KNEW WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND AND BECAUSE THEY HADN'T ANYTHING BETTER TO DO
4013-182396-0010 THEY ALSO STARTED FOR THE SMILING POOL GRANDFATHER FROG WAS SITTING ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY PAD IN THE WARM SUNSHINE AND FOR ONCE HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE TEASED FOR A STORY CHUG A RUM SAID HE IN HIS DEEP VOICE
4013-182396-0011 IT'S VERY STRANGE TO ME HOW LITTLE SOME FOLKS KNOW ABOUT THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBORS HE LOOKED UP AND WINKED AT JOLLY ROUND BRIGHT MISTER SUN STRIPED CHIPMUNK JOHNNY CHUCK JIMMY SKUNK AND DANNY MEADOW MOUSE
4013-182396-0012 LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY FELT VERY FOOLISH AS INDEED THEY DID YOU SEE ALL THEIR LIVES MINER THE MOLE HAD BEEN ONE OF THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBORS AND YET THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT HIM IT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO
4013-182396-0013 CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG INTERRUPTED DANNY MEADOW MOUSE OF COURSE REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG PRETENDING TO BE VERY MUCH PUT OUT AT SUCH A FOOLISH QUESTION
4013-182396-0014 IN THOSE DAYS MINER'S GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED DIDN'T LIVE UNDER GROUND CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG NOBODY DID HE WASN'T SO VERY DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF OTHER ANIMALS
4013-182396-0015 FOOD WAS PLENTY AND EVERYBODY WAS ON THE BEST OF TERMS WITH EVERYBODY ELSE MISTER MOLE LIVED JUST AS THE REST DID HE WENT AND CAME AS HE PLEASED AND ENJOYED THE SUNSHINE AND TOOK PART IN ALL THE GOOD TIMES OF HIS NEIGHBORS
4013-182396-0016 EVERYBODY LIKED HIM AND WHENEVER HE MADE A CALL HE WAS SURE OF A WELCOME BUT ONE THING MISTER MOLE NEVER DID HE NEVER MEDDLED IN OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS NO SIR
4013-182396-0017 MISTER MOLE NEVER POKED HIS NOSE IN WHERE HE HAD NO BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME EVERYTHING WENT SMOOTHLY WITH ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE GREEN FOREST AND THE GREEN MEADOWS
4013-182396-0018 THEY GREW HARDER AND HARDER FOOD WAS SCARCE AND KEPT GROWING MORE SCARCE EVERYBODY WAS HUNGRY AND YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WITH HUNGRY PEOPLE THEY GROW UGLY AND QUARRELSOME MATTERS GREW WORSE AND WORSE
4013-182396-0019 AND THEN IT WAS THAT FEAR WAS BORN THE BIG PEOPLE LIKE OLD KING BEAR AND MISTER WOLF AND MISTER PANTHER AND MISTER LYNX BEGAN TO LOOK WITH HUNGRY EYES ON THE LITTLE PEOPLE
4013-182396-0020 AND THE LITTLE PEOPLE BEGAN TO GROW AFRAID AND HIDE FROM THE BIG PEOPLE AND ALL THE TIME THEY WERE CONTINUALLY QUARRELING AMONG THEMSELVES AND STEALING FROM EACH OTHER TO GET ENOUGH TO EAT NOW AS I SAID BEFORE
4013-182396-0021 HE WENT OFF BY HIMSELF TO THINK THINGS OVER IT ISN'T SAFE TO RUN AROUND ANY MORE SAID HE I MET MISTER WOLF THIS MORNING AND HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SUCH A HUNGRY LOOK IN HIS EYES THAT IT GAVE ME THE COLD SHIVERS I BELIEVE HE WOULD HAVE
4013-182396-0022 EATEN ME IF I HADN'T CRAWLED INTO AN OLD HOLLOW STUMP NOW I CAN'T RUN FAST BECAUSE MY LEGS ARE TOO SHORT I CAN'T CLIMB TREES LIKE MISTER SQUIRREL AND I CAN'T SWIM LIKE MISTER MUSKRAT THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS TO DIG
4013-182396-0023 YOU SEE
4013-182396-0024 AND HE HAD DONE SO MUCH OF IT THAT HIS FRONT LEGS AND CLAWS HAD GROWN VERY STOUT NOW IF I DIG A HOLE AND KEEP OUT OF SIGHT I WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MISTER WOLF OR ANYBODY ELSE CONTINUED MISTER MOLE TO HIMSELF
4013-182396-0025 SO HE WENT TO WORK AT ONCE AND DUG A HOLE ON THE GREEN MEADOWS AND BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE COMFORTABLE HE MADE A BIG HOLE WHEN IT WAS FINISHED HE WAS TIRED SO HE CURLED UP AT THE BOTTOM FOR A NAP
4013-182396-0026 HE WAS AWAKENED BY HEARING VOICES OUTSIDE HE KNEW THOSE VOICES RIGHT AWAY THEY WERE THE VOICES OF MISTER FOX AND MISTER BADGER THESE ARE TERRIBLE TIMES SAID MISTER FOX I'M SO HUNGRY
4013-182396-0027 I WONDER WHO HAS DUG THIS HOLE MISTER MOLE REPLIED MISTER BADGER I SAW HIM AT WORK HERE THIS MORNING HAVE YOU NOTICED HOW VERY PLUMP HE LOOKS YES REPLIED MISTER FOX
4013-182396-0028 HE MADE MY MOUTH WATER THE VERY LAST TIME I SAW HIM SEEMS TO ME I CAN SMELL HIM NOW IF HE HAD MADE THIS HOLE JUST A LITTLE BIT BIGGER I WOULD GO DOWN AND PULL HIM OUT BUT I AM TOO TIRED TO DO ANY DIGGING NOW
4013-182396-0029 I TELL YOU WHAT REPLIED MISTER BADGER WE'LL HUNT TOGETHER A LITTLE LONGER AND THEN IF WE CAN'T FIND ANYTHING TO EAT WE'LL COME BACK AND I'LL HELP YOU DIG I HATE TO HURT MISTER MOLE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS MINDS HIS OWN BUSINESS
4013-182396-0030 OH DEAR OH DEAR WHAT EVER CAN I DO HE LAY THERE FEELING VERY HELPLESS AND MISERABLE
4013-182396-0031 IF HE HAD MADE HIS HOLE SMALL JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO CRAWL INTO MISTER BADGER AND MISTER FOX WOULD HAVE HAD TO DO A GREAT DEAL OF DIGGING TO MAKE IT BIG ENOUGH FOR EITHER OF THEM TO GET IN HE WOULD MAKE A LITTLE TUNNEL OFF ONE SIDE
4013-182396-0032 AND HIDE IN THAT SO HE WENT TO WORK AND MADE A LITTLE TUNNEL OFF ONE SIDE JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SQUEEZE INTO HE WORKED VERY HARD AND VERY FAST AND BY THE TIME MISTER BADGER AND MISTER FOX RETURNED
4013-182396-0033 MISTER MOLE WAS AT THE END OF A LONG TUNNEL SO FAR FROM THE HOLE HE HAD FIRST DUG THAT HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM A LONG TIME TO DIG HIM OUT EVEN IF THEY NOTICED HIS TUNNEL BUT THEY DIDN'T THEY DUG DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF HIS HOLE AND THEN
4013-182396-0034 BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FIND HIM THERE THEY STRAIGHTWAY FELL TO QUARRELING EACH BLAMING THE OTHER FOR SUGGESTING SUCH A LOT OF HARD WORK FOR NOTHING FINALLY THEY WENT AWAY STILL CALLING EACH OTHER NAMES AND FROM THAT DAY TO THIS
4013-182396-0035 MISTER MOLE SPENT ALL HIS TIME IN HIS TUNNELS AND SELDOM PUT HIS NOSE OUTSIDE HE WAS SAFE AND HE WAS COMFORTABLE AND HE COULD ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING TO EAT BY DIGGING FOR IT LITTLE BY LITTLE HIS OLD NEIGHBORS FORGOT ALL ABOUT HIM
4013-182396-0036 BECAUSE HE HAD LITTLE USE FOR THEM HIS EYES GREW SMALLER AND SMALLER AND WHEN HE DID COME UP INTO THE LIGHT THEY HURT HIM SO THAT HE WAS GLAD TO GO BACK INTO THE DARK AGAIN HE WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND SATISFIED THERE
4013-182396-0037 AND WHAT IS THERE IN LIFE BETTER THAN TO BE HAPPY AND SATISFIED NOTHING REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK AT WHOM GRANDFATHER FROG HAPPENED TO BE LOOKING WHEN HE ASKED THE QUESTION RIGHT REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG
4013-182396-0038 AND NOW YOU KNOW WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND BECAUSE HE IS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND SATISFIED THERE JUST THEN UP CAME PETER RABBIT ALL OUT OF BREATH HAS GRANDFATHER FROG BEEN TELLING A STORY HE PANTED
4331-57179-0000 THAN SHE HAD PROBABLY EVER PAID TO ANY MATTER UP TO THAT TIME
4331-57179-0001 BUT NEVER SO MUCH IN EARNEST AS NOW THOSE OTHER MEN HAD PERHAPS BEEN WORTHY WORTHY AS FAR AS HER IDEAS WENT OF WORTH
4331-57179-0002 EVERYTHING WAS THERE IF SHE COULD ONLY GET IT MONEY RANK FASHION AND AN APPETITE FOR PLEASURE AND HE WAS HANDSOME TOO AND GOOD HUMOURED THOUGH THESE QUALITIES TOLD LESS WITH HER THAN THE OTHERS
4331-57179-0003 AND NOW SHE WAS TO MEET HIM IN THE HOUSE OF HER GREAT RELATIONS IN A POSITION IN WHICH HER RANK AND HER FASHION WOULD SEEM TO BE EQUAL TO HIS OWN AND SHE WOULD MEET HIM WITH THE REMEMBRANCE FRESH IN HIS MIND AS IN HER OWN OF THOSE PASSAGES OF LOVE AT RUFFORD
4331-57179-0004 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD EVEN SEEM TO FORGET THEM THE MOST THAT SHE COULD EXPECT WOULD BE FOUR OR FIVE DAYS OF HIS COMPANY AND SHE KNEW THAT SHE MUST BE UPON HER METTLE SHE MUST DO MORE NOW
4331-57179-0005 SHE MUST SCRUPLE AT NOTHING THAT MIGHT BIND HIM SHE WOULD BE IN THE HOUSE OF HER UNCLE AND THAT UNCLE A DUKE
4331-57179-0006 SHE THOUGHT OF IT ALL AND MADE HER PLANS CAREFULLY AND EVEN PAINFULLY
4331-57179-0007 DURING THAT TIME SHE WOULD CURRY FAVOUR WITH HER UNCLE BY ALL HER ARTS AND WOULD IF POSSIBLE RECONCILE HERSELF TO HER AUNT SHE THOUGHT ONCE OF TAKING HER AUNT INTO HER FULL CONFIDENCE AND BALANCED THE MATTER MUCH IN HER MIND
4331-57179-0008 THE DUCHESS SHE KNEW WAS AFRAID OF HER OR RATHER AFRAID OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND WOULD OF COURSE BE PLEASED TO HAVE ALL FEARS SET AT REST BY SUCH AN ALLIANCE BUT HER AUNT WAS A WOMAN WHO HAD NEVER SUFFERED HARDSHIPS
4331-57179-0009 WHOSE OWN MARRIAGE HAD BEEN EASILY ARRANGED AND WHOSE TWO DAUGHTERS HAD BEEN PLEASANTLY MARRIED BEFORE THEY WERE TWENTY YEARS OLD
4331-57179-0010 BUT SHE COULD NOT VENTURE TO ASK FOR IT SHE HAD STRETCHED HER MEANS AND HER CREDIT TO THE UTMOST IN REGARD TO HER WARDROBE AND WAS AWARE THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO WELL EQUIPPED SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS OF HER CAREER
4331-57179-0011 IN WHICH HER FATHER AND MOTHER HAD THOUGHT THAT HER BEAUTY ASSISTED BY A GENEROUS EXPENDITURE WOULD SERVE TO DISPOSE OF HER WITHOUT DELAY A GENEROUS EXPENDITURE MAY BE INCURRED ONCE EVEN BY POOR PEOPLE BUT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE MAINTAINED OVER A DOZEN YEARS
4331-57179-0012 NOW SHE HAD TAKEN THE MATTER INTO HER OWN HANDS AND HAD DONE THAT WHICH WOULD BE RUINOUS IF NOT SUCCESSFUL
4331-57179-0013 WITH THE PROSPECT OF DROWNING HERSELF ON THE WAY OUT TO PATAGONIA SHOULD THE CHANCES OF THE GAME GO AGAINST HER SHE FORGOT NOTHING SHE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR MORE THAN ONE DAY'S HUNTING AND YET THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR AS THOUGH SHE WERE GOING TO RIDE WITH THE HOUNDS THROUGH ALL THE REMAINDER OF THE SEASON
4331-57179-0014 WHEN SHE REACHED MISTLETOE THERE WERE PEOPLE GOING AND COMING EVERY DAY SO THAT AN ARRIVAL WAS NO EVENT SHE WAS KISSED BY HER UNCLE AND WELCOMED WITH CHARACTERISTIC COLDNESS BY HER AUNT THEN ALLOWED TO SETTLE IN AMONG THE OTHER GUESTS
4331-57179-0015 EVERYBODY KNEW THAT SHE WAS A TREFOIL AND HER PRESENCE THEREFORE RAISED NO QUESTION THE DUCHESS OF OMNIUM WAS AMONG THE GUESTS THE DUCHESS KNEW ALL ABOUT HER AND VOUCHSAFED TO HER THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE RECOGNITION LADY CHILTERN HAD MET HER BEFORE
4331-57179-0016 AND AS LADY CHILTERN WAS ALWAYS GENEROUS SHE WAS GRACIOUS TO ARABELLA SHE WAS SORRY TO SEE LADY DRUMMOND BECAUSE SHE CONNECTED LADY DRUMMOND WITH THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND FEARED THAT THE CONVERSATION MIGHT BE LED TO PATAGONIA AND ITS NEW MINISTER
4331-57179-0017 THE GIRL WAS HIS NIECE AND THE DUKE HAD AN IDEA THAT HE SHOULD BE KIND TO THE FAMILY OF WHICH HE WAS THE HEAD HIS BROTHER'S WIFE HAD BECOME OBJECTIONABLE TO HIM BUT AS TO THE GIRL IF SHE WANTED A HOME FOR A WEEK OR TWO HE THOUGHT IT TO BE HIS DUTY TO GIVE IT TO HER
4331-57179-0018 MISTLETOE IS AN ENORMOUS HOUSE WITH A FRONTAGE NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILE LONG COMBINING AS IT DOES ALL THE OFFICES COACH HOUSES AND STABLES THERE IS NOTHING IN ENGLAND MORE UGLY OR PERHAPS MORE COMFORTABLE
4331-57179-0019 AND SIX IN LONDON IN WHICH HE GAVE DINNERS AND DINED OUT AND REGULARLY TOOK HIS PLACE IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS WITHOUT EVER OPENING HIS MOUTH HE WAS A GREY HAIRED COMELY MAN OF SIXTY WITH A LARGE BODY AND A WONDERFUL APPETITE
4331-57179-0020 BY MANY WHO UNDERSTOOD THE SUBJECT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST AMATEUR JUDGE OF WINE IN ENGLAND
4331-57179-0021 AT ALL POINTS LORD MISTLETOE WHO HAD A LARGE FAMILY OF HIS OWN LIVED TWENTY MILES OFF SO THAT THE FATHER AND SON COULD MEET PLEASANTLY WITHOUT FEAR OF QUARRELLING DURING THE FIRST EVENING ARABELLA DID CONTRIVE TO MAKE HERSELF VERY AGREEABLE
4331-57179-0022 SHE WAS MUCH QUIETER THAN HAD BEEN HER WONT WHEN AT MISTLETOE BEFORE AND THOUGH THERE WERE PRESENT TWO OR THREE VERY WELL CIRCUMSTANCED YOUNG MEN SHE TOOK BUT LITTLE NOTICE OF THEM SHE WENT OUT TO DINNER WITH SIR JEFFREY BUNKER
4331-57179-0023 AND MADE HERSELF AGREEABLE TO THAT OLD GENTLEMAN IN A REMARKABLE MANNER AFTER DINNER SOMETHING HAVING BEEN SAID OF THE RESPECTABLE OLD GAME CALLED CAT'S CRADLE SHE PLAYED IT TO PERFECTION WITH SIR JEFFREY TILL HER AUNT THOUGHT THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN UNAWARE
4331-57179-0024 THAT SIR JEFFREY HAD A WIFE AND FAMILY SHE WAS ALL SMILES AND ALL PLEASANTNESS AND SEEMED TO WANT NO OTHER HAPPINESS THAN WHAT THE PRESENT MOMENT GAVE HER NOR DID SHE ONCE MENTION LORD RUFFORD'S NAME ON THE NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST HER AUNT SENT FOR HER TO COME UP STAIRS
4331-57179-0025 SUCH A THING HAD NEVER HAPPENED TO HER BEFORE SHE COULD NOT RECOLLECT THAT ON ANY OF THOSE ANNUAL VISITS WHICH SHE HAD MADE TO MISTLETOE FOR MORE YEARS THAN SHE NOW LIKED TO THINK OF SHE HAD EVER HAD FIVE MINUTES CONVERSATION ALONE WITH HER AUNT
4331-57179-0026 THE MESSAGE WAS WHISPERED INTO HER EAR BY HER AUNT'S OWN WOMAN AS SHE WAS LISTENING WITH GREAT ATTENTION TO LADY DRUMMOND'S TROUBLES IN REGARD TO HER NURSERY ARRANGEMENTS SHE NODDED HER HEAD
4331-57179-0027 THAT HER AUNT WANTED HER FOLLOWED THE MAID UP STAIRS MY DEAR SAID HER AUNT WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED I WANT TO ASK YOU WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ASK MISTER MORTON TO COME HERE WHILE YOU ARE WITH US
4331-57179-0028 A THUNDERBOLT AT HER FEET COULD HARDLY HAVE SURPRISED OR ANNOYED HER MORE IF THERE WAS ONE THING THAT SHE WANTED LESS THAN ANOTHER IT WAS THE PRESENCE OF THE PARAGON AT MISTLETOE IT WOULD UTTERLY SUBVERT EVERYTHING AND ROB HER OF EVERY CHANCE
4331-57179-0029 WITH A GREAT EFFORT SHE RESTRAINED ALL EMOTION AND SIMPLY SHOOK HER HEAD SHE DID IT VERY WELL AND BETRAYED NOTHING I ASK SAID THE DUCHESS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED TO MARRY HIM LORD DRUMMOND TELLS ME THAT HE IS A MOST RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN
4331-57179-0030 MISTER MORTON WILL BE SO MUCH OBLIGED TO LORD DRUMMOND AND I THOUGHT THAT IF IT WERE SO YOU WOULD BE GLAD THAT HE SHOULD MEET YOU HERE I COULD MANAGE IT VERY WELL AS THE DRUMMONDS ARE HERE AND LORD DRUMMOND WOULD BE GLAD TO MEET HIM
4331-57179-0031 BUT STILL BY THE TIME THAT SHE WAS CALLED ON TO SPEAK SHE HAD FABRICATED HER STORY THANKS AUNT IT IS SO GOOD OF YOU AND IF EVERYTHING WAS GOING STRAIGHT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING OF COURSE THAT I SHOULD LIKE SO MUCH
4331-57179-0032 BUT PAPA AND MAMMA AND THE LAWYERS THINK THAT HE IS NOT BEHAVING WELL ABOUT MONEY
4331-57179-0033 WOULD KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MISTER MORTON AND NOW SHE WAS CALLED UPON TO ANSWER THESE HORRID QUESTIONS WITHOUT A MOMENT'S NOTICE I DON'T THINK I SHALL GO WITH HIM AUNT THOUGH I AM UNABLE TO SAY ANYTHING CERTAIN JUST AT PRESENT
4331-57179-0034 I HOPE NOT YOU SHOULD THINK OF IT VERY SERIOUSLY AS FOR MONEY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NONE OF YOUR OWN AND I AM TOLD THAT HE HAS A VERY NICE PROPERTY IN RUFFORD THERE IS A NEIGHBOUR OF HIS COMING HERE TO MORROW AND PERHAPS HE KNOWS HIM WHO IS THE NEIGHBOUR AUNT
4331-57179-0035 ASKED ARABELLA INNOCENTLY LORD RUFFORD HE IS COMING TO SHOOT I WILL ASK HIM ABOUT THE PROPERTY
4331-57179-0036 I KNOW LORD RUFFORD VERY WELL KNOW LORD RUFFORD VERY WELL AS ONE DOES KNOW MEN THAT ONE MEETS ABOUT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT SETTLE EVERYTHING IF WE HAD MISTER MORTON HERE I COULDN'T MEET HIM AUNT I COULDN'T INDEED
4331-57179-0037 TO THE DUCHESS CONDEMNATION FROM LADY AUGUSTUS ALMOST AMOUNTED TO PRAISE SHE FELT SURE THAT MISTER MORTON WAS A WORTHY MAN WHO WOULD NOT PROBABLY BEHAVE BADLY AND THOUGH SHE COULD NOT UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY AND CERTAINLY HAD NO SUSPICION IN REGARD TO LORD RUFFORD
4331-57179-0038 SHE WAS SURE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG BUT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID AT PRESENT AFTER WHAT ARABELLA HAD TOLD HER MISTER MORTON COULD NOT BE ASKED THERE TO MEET HER NIECE BUT ALL THE SLIGHT FEELING OF KINDNESS TO THE GIRL WHICH HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE TIDINGS OF SO RESPECTABLE AN ENGAGEMENT
4331-57179-0039 WERE AT ONCE OBLITERATED FROM THE DUCHESS'S BOSOM ARABELLA WITH MANY EXPRESSIONS OF THANKS AND A GOOD HUMOURED COUNTENANCE LEFT THE ROOM CURSING THE UNTOWARDNESS OF HER FATE WHICH WOULD LET NOTHING RUN SMOOTH LORD RUFFORD WAS TO COME THAT AT ANY RATE WAS NOW ALMOST CERTAIN
4331-57179-0040 UP TO THE PRESENT SHE HAD DOUBTED KNOWING THE WAY IN WHICH SUCH MEN WILL CHANGE THEIR ENGAGEMENTS AT THE LEAST CAPRICE BUT THE DUCHESS EXPECTED HIM ON THE MORROW
4331-57179-0041 SHE HAD PREPARED THE WAY FOR MEETING HIM AS AN OLD FRIEND WITHOUT CAUSING SURPRISE AND HAD GAINED THAT STEP BUT SHOULD SHE SUCCEED AS SHE HOPED
4331-57179-0042 IN EXACTING CONTINUED HOMAGE FROM THE MAN HOMAGE FOR THE FOUR OR FIVE DAYS OF HIS SOJOURN AT MISTLETOE THIS MUST BE CARRIED ON WITH THE KNOWLEDGE ON THE PART OF MANY IN THE HOUSE THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO THAT HORRID PATAGONIAN MINISTER
4331-57179-0043 WAS EVER A GIRL CALLED UPON TO RISK HER ENTIRE FATE UNDER SO MANY DISADVANTAGES WHEN SHE WENT UP TO DRESS FOR DINNER ON THE DAY OF HIS EXPECTED ARRIVAL LORD RUFFORD HAD NOT COME SINCE THE INTERVIEW IN HER AUNT'S ROOM SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIS NAME MENTIONED
4331-57179-0044 WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM A LITTLE LATE HE WAS NOT THERE WE WON'T WAIT DUCHESS SAID THE DUKE TO HIS WIFE AT THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE DUKE'S PUNCTUALITY AT DINNER TIME WAS WELL KNOWN AND EVERYBODY ELSE WAS THEN ASSEMBLED
4331-57179-0045 WITHIN TWO MINUTES AFTER THE DUKE'S WORD DINNER WAS ANNOUNCED AND A PARTY NUMBERING ABOUT THIRTY WALKED AWAY INTO THE DINNER ROOM ARABELLA WHEN THEY WERE ALL SETTLED FOUND THAT THERE WAS A VACANT SEAT NEXT HERSELF IF THE MAN WERE TO COME FORTUNE WOULD HAVE FAVOURED HER IN THAT
4331-57179-0046 THE FISH AND SOUP HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED AND THE DUKE WAS WAKENING HIMSELF TO ELOQUENCE ON THE FIRST ENTREE WHEN LORD RUFFORD ENTERED THE ROOM
4331-57179-0047 NOR ANY PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH HIRED HORSES TRAVEL SO SLOWLY I BEG THE DUKE'S PARDON BUT I SUFFER THE LESS BECAUSE I KNOW HIS GRACE NEVER WAITS FOR ANYBODY CERTAINLY NOT SAID THE DUKE HAVING SOME REGARD FOR MY FRIENDS DINNERS
4331-57179-0048 AND I FIND MYSELF NEXT TO YOU SAID LORD RUFFORD AS HE TOOK HIS SEAT
4331-57180-0000 I SHALL BE PROUD TO RENEW MY ACQUAINTANCE CAN YOU COME TO MORROW OH YES SAID ARABELLA RAPTUROUSLY THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES AND I OUGHT TO HAVE WRITTEN TO YOU ABOUT THEM I AM GOING WITH THE FITZWILLIAM
4331-57180-0001 NOW MISTLETOE WAS IN LINCOLNSHIRE NOT VERY FAR FROM PETERBOROUGH NOT VERY FAR FROM STAMFORD NOT VERY FAR FROM OAKHAM A REGULAR HUNTING MAN LIKE LORD RUFFORD KNEW HOW TO COMPASS THE DIFFICULTIES OF DISTANCE IN ALL HUNTING COUNTRIES
4331-57180-0002 AND A POSTCHAISE COULD MEET HIM HERE OR THERE BUT WHEN A LADY IS ADDED THE DIFFICULTY IS OFTEN INCREASED FIVEFOLD IS IT VERY FAR ASKED ARABELLA IT IS A LITTLE FAR I WONDER WHO ARE GOING FROM HERE
4331-57180-0003 HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS I HAVE PASSED MY TIME IN PLAYING CAT'S CRADLE WITH SIR JEFFREY BUNKER FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE COMPANY AND IN CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH MY AUNT AND LADY DRUMMOND I HAVEN'T HEARD HUNTING MENTIONED
4331-57180-0004 HAVE YOU ANYTHING ON WHEELS GOING ACROSS TO HOLCOMBE CROSS TO MORROW DUKE ASKED LORD RUFFORD THE DUKE SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW OF ANYTHING ON WHEELS GOING TO HOLCOMBE CROSS THEN A HUNTING MAN WHO HAD HEARD THE QUESTION
4331-57180-0005 SAID THAT HE AND ANOTHER INTENDED TO TRAVEL BY TRAIN TO OUNDLE UPON THIS LORD RUFFORD TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT ARABELLA MOURNFULLY CANNOT I GO BY TRAIN TO OUNDLE SHE ASKED NOTHING ON EARTH SO JOLLY IF YOUR PASTORS AND MASTERS AND ALL THAT WILL LET YOU
4331-57180-0006 I HAVEN'T GOT ANY PASTORS AND MASTERS THE DUCHESS SUGGESTED LORD RUFFORD I THOUGHT ALL THAT KIND OF NONSENSE WAS OVER SAID ARABELLA I BELIEVE A GREAT DEAL IS OVER YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS THAT YOUR MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER COULDN'T DO BUT ABSOLUTE FREEDOM
4331-57180-0007 WHAT YOU MAY CALL UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE HASN'T COME YET I FEAR IT'S TWENTY MILES BY ROAD AND THE DUCHESS WOULD SAY SOMETHING AWFUL IF I WERE TO PROPOSE TO TAKE YOU IN A POSTCHAISE BUT THE RAILWAY I'M AFRAID THAT WOULD BE WORSE WE COULDN'T RIDE BACK YOU KNOW AS WE DID AT RUFFORD
4331-57180-0008 I'M AFRAID WE MUST PUT IT OFF TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I'M THE LEAST BIT IN THE WORLD AFRAID OF THE DUCHESS I AM NOT AT ALL SAID ARABELLA ANGRILY THEN LORD RUFFORD ATE HIS DINNER AND SEEMED TO THINK THAT THAT MATTER WAS SETTLED
4331-57180-0009 ARABELLA KNEW THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HUNTED ELSEWHERE THAT THE COTTESMORE WOULD BE OUT IN THEIR OWN COUNTY WITHIN TWELVE MILES OF THEM AND THAT THE DIFFICULTY OF THAT RIDE WOULD BE VERY MUCH LESS THE DUKE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PERSUADED TO SEND A CARRIAGE THAT DISTANCE
4331-57180-0010 BUT LORD RUFFORD CARED MORE ABOUT THE CHANCE OF A GOOD RUN THAN HER COMPANY FOR A WHILE SHE WAS SULKY FOR A LITTLE WHILE TILL SHE REMEMBERED HOW ILL SHE COULD AFFORD TO INDULGE IN SUCH A FEELING THEN SHE SAID A DEMURE WORD OR TWO TO THE GENTLEMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER
4331-57180-0011 AND IS THAT TO BE THE END OF JACK AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT EVER SINCE THIS IS THURSDAY NOT A DOUBT ABOUT IT
4331-57180-0012 TO MORROW WILL BE FRIDAY AND THE DUKE HAS HIS GREAT SHOOTING ON SATURDAY THERE'S NOTHING WITHIN A HUNDRED MILES OF US ON SATURDAY I SHALL GO WITH THE PYTCHLEY IF I DON'T SHOOT BUT I SHALL HAVE TO GET UP JUST WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BED THAT WOULDN'T SUIT YOU
4331-57180-0013 I WOULDN'T MIND IF I DIDN'T GO TO BED AT ALL AT ANY RATE IT WOULDN'T SUIT THE DUCHESS I HAD MEANT TO GO AWAY ON SUNDAY I HATE BEING ANYWHERE ON SUNDAY EXCEPT IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE BUT IF I THOUGHT THE DUKE WOULD KEEP ME TILL TUESDAY MORNING WE MIGHT MANAGE PELTRY ON MONDAY
4331-57180-0015 IF NOT WE MUST PUT A GOOD FACE ON IT AND GO IN ANYTHING WE CAN GET I SHOULDN'T FEAR THE DUCHESS SO MUCH FOR TWELVE MILES AS I SHOULD FOR TWENTY I DON'T MEAN TO LET THE DUCHESS INTERFERE WITH ME SAID ARABELLA IN A WHISPER
4331-57180-0016 THAT EVENING LORD RUFFORD WAS VERY GOOD NATURED AND MANAGED TO ARRANGE EVERYTHING LADY CHILTERN AND ANOTHER LADY SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE GLAD TO GO TO THE MEET
4331-57180-0017 BUT NOTHING WAS SAID AS TO ARABELLA'S HUNTING BECAUSE THE QUESTION WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE RAISED AS TO HER RETURN TO MISTLETOE IN THE EVENING IT WAS HOWEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS TO HAVE A PLACE IN THE CARRIAGE ARABELLA HAD GAINED TWO THINGS SHE WOULD HAVE HER ONE DAY'S HUNTING
4331-57180-0018 AND SHE HAD SECURED THE PRESENCE OF LORD RUFFORD AT MISTLETOE FOR SUNDAY WITH SUCH A MAN AS HIS LORDSHIP IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A MOMENT FOR CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATION HE WORKED SO HARD AT HIS AMUSEMENTS THAT HE WAS AS BAD A LOVER AS A BARRISTER WHO HAS TO BE IN COURT ALL DAY
4331-57180-0019 ALMOST AS BAD AS A SAILOR WHO IS ALWAYS GOING ROUND THE WORLD
4331-57180-0020 ON THIS EVENING IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK BEFORE THE GENTLEMEN CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND THEN LORD RUFFORD'S TIME WAS SPENT IN ARRANGING THE PARTY FOR THE MEET ON MONDAY WHEN THE LADIES WENT UP TO BED ARABELLA HAD HAD NO OTHER OPPORTUNITY THAN WHAT FORTUNE HAD GIVEN HER AT DINNER AND EVEN THEN SHE HAD BEEN WATCHED
4331-57180-0021 AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH HER GRACE HAD THOUGHT SAFE WITH REFERENCE TO THE RIGHTS OF THE MINISTER TO PATAGONIA THE DUCHESS THOUGH SHE WAS AT SOME DISTANCE DOWN THE TABLE HAD SEEN THAT HER NIECE AND LORD RUFFORD WERE INTIMATE AND REMEMBERED IMMEDIATELY WHAT HAD BEEN SAID UP STAIRS THEY COULD NOT HAVE TALKED AS THEY WERE THEN TALKING
4331-57180-0022 SOMETIMES WHISPERING AS THE DUCHESS COULD PERCEIVE VERY WELL UNLESS THERE HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLE FORMER INTIMACY SHE BEGAN GRADUALLY TO UNDERSTAND VARIOUS THINGS WHY ARABELLA TREFOIL HAD BEEN SO ANXIOUS TO COME TO MISTLETOE JUST AT THIS TIME
4331-57180-0023 WHY SHE HAD BEHAVED SO UNLIKE HER USUAL SELF BEFORE LORD RUFFORD'S ARRIVAL AND WHY SHE HAD BEEN SO UNWILLING TO HAVE MISTER MORTON INVITED THE DUCHESS WAS IN HER WAY A CLEVER WOMAN AND COULD SEE MANY THINGS SHE COULD SEE THAT THOUGH HER NIECE MIGHT BE VERY ANXIOUS TO MARRY LORD RUFFORD
4331-57180-0024 LORD RUFFORD MIGHT INDULGE HIMSELF IN A CLOSE INTIMACY WITH THE GIRL WITHOUT ANY SUCH INTENTION ON HIS PART AND AS FAR AS THE FAMILY WAS CONCERNED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE MORTON ALLIANCE SHE WOULD HAVE ASKED MORTON NOW
4331-57180-0025 THE DUCHESS OF OMNIUM HAD SINCE DECLARED THAT SHE ALSO WOULD GO AND THERE WERE TO BE TWO CARRIAGES BUT STILL IT NEVER OCCURRED TO THE DUCHESS THAT ARABELLA INTENDED TO HUNT NOR DID ARABELLA INTEND THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW IT TILL THE MORNING CAME THE FRIDAY WAS VERY DULL
4331-57180-0026 THE HUNTING MEN OF COURSE HAD GONE BEFORE ARABELLA CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE GOT UP AT SEVEN TO POUR OUT LORD RUFFORD'S TEA HAD THAT BEEN POSSIBLE BUT AS IT WAS SHE STROLLED INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM AT HALF PAST TEN
4331-57180-0027 SHE COULD SEE BY HER AUNT'S EYE AND HEAR IN HER VOICE THAT SHE WAS IN PART DETECTED AND THAT SHE WOULD DO HERSELF NO FURTHER SERVICE BY ACTING THE GOOD GIRL AND SHE THEREFORE RESOLUTELY DETERMINED TO LISTEN TO NO MORE TWADDLE SHE READ A FRENCH NOVEL WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER
4331-57180-0028 AND SPENT AS MUCH OF THE DAY AS SHE COULD IN HER BEDROOM SHE DID NOT SEE LORD RUFFORD BEFORE DINNER AND AT DINNER SAT BETWEEN SIR JEFFREY AND AN OLD GENTLEMAN OUT OF STAMFORD WHO DINED AT MISTLETOE THAT EVENING WE'VE HAD NO SUCH LUCK TO NIGHT LORD RUFFORD SAID TO HER IN THE DRAWING ROOM
4331-57180-0029 THE OLD DRAGON TOOK CARE OF THAT REPLIED ARABELLA
4331-57180-0030 BECAUSE I CAN'T VERY WELL TELL YOU WHY BUT I DARE SAY YOU KNOW AND DO YOU THINK I AM DANGEROUS
4331-57180-0031 OF COURSE THERE IS A LITTLE DANGER BUT WHO IS GOING TO BE STOPPED BY THAT
4331-57180-0032 HE COULD MAKE NO REPLY TO THIS BECAUSE THE DUCHESS CALLED HIM AWAY TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT TO LADY CHILTERN ABOUT GOARLY AND THE U R U LADY CHILTERN'S HUSBAND BEING A MASTER OF HOUNDS AND A GREAT AUTHORITY ON ALL MATTERS RELATING TO HUNTING NASTY OLD DRAGON
4331-57180-0033 THE SATURDAY WAS THE DAY OF THE GREAT SHOOTING AND AT TWO O'CLOCK THE LADIES WENT OUT TO LUNCH WITH THE GENTLEMEN BY THE SIDE OF THE WOOD LORD RUFFORD HAD AT LAST CONSENTED TO BE ONE OF THE PARTY WITH LOGS OF TREES A FEW HURDLES AND OTHER FIELD APPLIANCES
4331-57180-0034 A RUSTIC BANQUETING HALL WAS PREPARED AND EVERYTHING WAS VERY NICE TONS OF GAME HAD BEEN KILLED AND TONS MORE WERE TO BE KILLED AFTER LUNCHEON THE DUCHESS WAS NOT THERE AND ARABELLA CONTRIVED SO TO PLACE HERSELF THAT SHE COULD BE WAITED UPON BY LORD RUFFORD OR COULD WAIT UPON HIM
4331-57180-0035 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY EYES WERE UPON HER BUT SHE KNEW HOW TO SUSTAIN THAT NOBODY WAS PRESENT WHO COULD DARE TO INTERFERE WITH HER
4331-57180-0036 WHEN THE EATING AND DRINKING WERE OVER SHE WALKED WITH HIM TO HIS CORNER BY THE NEXT COVERT NOT HEEDING THE OTHER LADIES AND SHE STOOD WITH HIM FOR SOME MINUTES AFTER THE SLAUGHTER HAD BEGUN SHE HAD COME TO FEEL THAT THE TIME WAS SLIPPING BETWEEN HER FINGERS AND THAT SHE MUST SAY SOMETHING EFFECTIVE
4331-57180-0037 TO MORROW IS SUNDAY I AM QUITE AWARE OF THAT BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER YOU COULD LIVE A DAY WITHOUT SPORT THE COUNTRY IS SO FULL OF PREJUDICE THAT I AM DRIVEN TO SABBATICAL QUIESCENCE
4331-88349-0000 CHAPTER ONE THE POINT OF VIEW WHILE THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF LITERARY REFERENCE IN ALL THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENT I REALIZE LOOKING BACK OVER MANY ATTEMPTS TO PARAPHRASE IT FOR VARIOUS AUDIENCES
4331-88349-0001 THAT ITS APPEAL IS TO THOSE WHO SPEND THE BEST PART OF THEIR STUDENT LIFE IN CLASSIFYING AND JUDGING AND PRODUCING WORKS OF SCULPTURE PAINTING AND ARCHITECTURE
4331-88349-0002 I FIND THE EYES OF ALL OTHERS WANDERING WHEN I MAKE TALKS UPON THE PLASTIC ARTIST'S POINT OF VIEW THIS BOOK TRIES TO FIND THAT FOURTH DIMENSION OF ARCHITECTURE PAINTING AND SCULPTURE WHICH IS THE HUMAN SOUL IN ACTION THAT ARROW WITH WINGS
4331-88349-0003 WHICH IS THE FLASH OF FIRE FROM THE FILM OR THE HEART OF MAN OR PYGMALION'S IMAGE WHEN IT BECOMES A WOMAN THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN EDITION WAS USED BY VICTOR O FREEBURG AS ONE OF THE TEXT BOOKS IN THE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM
4331-88349-0004 IN HIS CLASSES IN PHOTOPLAY WRITING I WAS INVITED SEVERAL TIMES TO ADDRESS THOSE CLASSES ON MY YEARLY VISITS TO NEW YORK I HAVE ADDRESSED MANY OTHER ACADEMIC CLASSES THE INVITATION BEING BASED ON THIS BOOK NOW I REALIZE
4331-88349-0005 THAT THOSE WHO APPROACH THE THEORY FROM THE GENERAL UNIVERSITY STANDPOINT OR FROM THE HISTORY OF THE DRAMA HAD BEST BEGIN WITH FREEBURG'S BOOK FOR HE IS NOT ONLY LEARNED IN BOTH MATTERS BUT PRESENTS THE SPECIAL ANALOGIES WITH SKILL
4331-88349-0006 FREEBURG HAS AN EXCELLENT EDUCATION IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC AND SOME OF THE HAPPIEST PASSAGES IN HIS WORK RELATE THE PHOTOPLAY TO THE MUSICAL THEORY OF THE WORLD AS MY BOOK RELATES IT TO THE GENERAL ART MUSEUM POINT OF VIEW OF THE WORLD
4331-88349-0007 EMPHATICALLY MY BOOK BELONGS IN THE ART INSTITUTES AS A BEGINNING OR IN SUCH RELIGIOUS AND CIVIC BODIES AS THINK ARCHITECTURALLY FROM THERE IT MUST WORK ITS WAY OUT
4331-88349-0008 OF COURSE THOSE BODIES TOUCH ON A THOUSAND OTHERS THE WORK IS BEING USED AS ONE BASIS OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE NEW DENVER ART MUSEUM AND I LIKE TO TELL THE STORY OF HOW GEORGE W EGGERS OF DENVER
4331-88349-0009 FIRST BEGAN TO APPLY THE BOOK WHEN THE DIRECTOR OF THE ART INSTITUTE CHICAGO THAT IT MAY NOT SEEM TO THE MERELY UNIVERSITY TYPE OF MIND A WORK OF LOST ABSTRACTIONS ONE OF THE MOST GRATIFYING RECOGNITIONS I EVER RECEIVED
4331-88349-0010 WAS THE INVITATION TO TALK ON THE FILMS IN FULLERTON HALL CHICAGO ART INSTITUTE THEN THERE CAME INVITATIONS TO SPEAK AT CHICAGO UNIVERSITY AND BEFORE THE FORTNIGHTLY CLUB CHICAGO ALL AROUND NINETEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN
4331-88349-0011 ONE DIFFICULTY WAS GETTING THE FILM TO PROVE MY CASE FROM OUT THE COMMERCIAL WHIRL I TALKED AT THESE THREE AND OTHER PLACES BUT HARDLY KNEW HOW TO GO ABOUT CROSSING THE COMMERCIAL BRIDGE
4331-88349-0012 AT LAST WITH THE COOPERATION OF DIRECTOR EGGERS WE STAGED IN THE SACRED PRECINCTS OF FULLERTON HALL MAE MARSH IN THE WILD GIRL OF THE SIERRAS THE FILM WAS IN BATTERED CONDITION AND WAS TURNED SO FAST I COULD NOT TALK WITH IT SATISFACTORILY
4331-88349-0013 AND FULFIL THE WELL KNOWN PRINCIPLES OF CHAPTER FOURTEEN BUT AT LEAST I HAD CONVERTED ONE ART INSTITUTE DIRECTOR TO THE IDEA THAT AN EX STUDENT OF THE INSTITUTE COULD NOT ONLY WRITE A BOOK ABOUT PAINTING IN MOTION
4331-88349-0014 BUT THE PAINTING COULD BE SHOWN IN AN ART MUSEUM AS PROMISE OF GREATER THINGS IN THIS WORLD IT TOOK A DEAL OF WILL AND BREAKING OF PRECEDENT ON THE PART OF ALL CONCERNED TO SHOW THIS FILM THE WILD GIRL OF THE SIERRAS
4331-88349-0015 AND I RETIRED FROM THE FIELD A LONG TIME BUT NOW THIS SAME EGGERS IS STARTING IN DENVER AN ART MUSEUM FROM ITS VERY FOUNDATIONS BUT ON THE SAME CONSTRUCTIVE SCALE SO THIS ENTERPRISE IN MY FOND AND FATUOUS FANCY
4331-88349-0016 IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SWEET MAE MARSH AS THE WILD GIRL OF THE SIERRAS ONE OF THE LOVELIEST BITS OF POETRY EVER PUT INTO SCREEN OR FABLE FOR ABOUT ONE YEAR OFF AND ON I HAD THE HONOR TO BE THE PHOTOPLAY CRITIC OF THE NEW REPUBLIC
4331-88349-0017 THIS INVITATION ALSO BASED ON THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS BOOK LOOKING BACK UPON THAT EXPERIENCE I AM DELIGHTED TO AFFIRM THAT NOT ONLY THE NEW REPUBLIC CONSTITUENCY BUT THE WORLD OF THE COLLEGE AND THE UNIVERSITY WHERE I MOVED AT THAT TIME
4331-88349-0018 WERE NOT ONLY WILLING BUT EAGER TO TAKE THE FILMS WITH SERIOUSNESS BUT WHEN I WAS THROUGH WITH ALL THESE DASHES INTO THE FIELD AND WENT BACK TO RECITING VERSES AGAIN NO ONE HAD GIVEN ME ANY LIGHT AS TO WHO SHOULD MAKE THE DISINTERESTED NON COMMERCIAL FILM
4331-88349-0019 FOR THESE IMMEDIATE TIMES THE FILM THAT WOULD CLASS IN OUR CIVILIZATION WITH THE NEW REPUBLIC OR THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY OR THE POEMS OF EDWIN ARLINGTON ROBINSON THAT IS THE PRODUCTION NOT FOR THE TRADE BUT FOR THE SOUL
4331-88349-0020 ANITA LOOS THAT GOOD CRUSADER CAME OUT SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH THE FLAMING ANNOUNCEMENT
4331-88349-0021 THE SCHOOL WAS TO BE LARGELY DEVOTED TO PRODUCING MUSIC FOR THE PHOTOPLAY IN DEFIANCE OF CHAPTER FOURTEEN BUT INCIDENTALLY THERE WERE TO BE MOTION PICTURES MADE TO FIT GOOD MUSIC NEITHER MUSIC NOR FILMS HAVE AS YET SHAKEN THE WORLD
4331-88349-0022 I LIKED THIS ROCHESTER IDEA I FELT THAT ONCE IT WAS STARTED THE FILMS WOULD TAKE THEIR PROPER PLACE AND DOMINATE THE PROJECT DISINTERESTED NON COMMERCIAL FILMS TO BE CLASSED
4331-88349-0023 WITH THE DRAMAS SO WELL STIMULATED BY THE GREAT DRAMA DEPARTMENT UNDER PROFESSOR BAKER OF HARVARD AS I LOOK BACK OVER THIS HISTORY I SEE THAT THE PRINTED PAGE HAD COUNTED TOO MUCH AND THE REAL FORCES OF THE VISIBLE ARTS IN AMERICA
4331-88349-0024 HAD NOT BEEN DEFINITELY ENLISTED THEY SHOULD TAKE THE LEAD I WOULD SUGGEST AS THE THREE PEOPLE TO INTERVIEW FIRST ON BUILDING ANY ART MUSEUM PHOTOPLAY PROJECT VICTOR FREEBURG WITH HIS LONG EXPERIENCE OF TEACHING THE SUBJECT IN COLUMBIA
4331-88349-0025 AND JOHN EMERSON AND ANITA LOOS WHO ARE AS BRAINY AS PEOPLE DARE TO BE AND STILL REMAIN IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE FILM BUSINESS NO THREE PEOPLE WOULD MORE WELCOME OPPORTUNITIES TO OUTLINE THE IDEALISTIC POSSIBILITIES OF THIS FUTURE ART
4331-88349-0026 AND A WELL KNOWN AMERICAN PAINTER WAS TALKING TO ME OF A MIDNIGHT SCOLDING CHARLIE CHAPLIN GAVE TO SOME LOS ANGELES PRODUCER IN A LITTLE RESTAURANT PREACHING THE REALLY BEAUTIFUL FILM AND DENOUNCING COMMERCE LIKE A MEMBER OF COXEY'S ILLUSTRIOUS ARMY
4331-88349-0027 AND I HAVE HEARD RUMORS FROM ALL SIDES THAT CHARLIE CHAPLIN HAS A SOUL HE IS THE COMEDIAN MOST OFTEN PROCLAIMED AN ARTIST BY THE FASTIDIOUS AND MOST OFTEN FORGIVEN FOR HIS SLAPSTICK HE IS PRAISED FOR A KIND OF O HENRY DOUBLE MEANING TO HIS ANTICS
4331-88349-0028 HE IS SAID TO BE LIKE ONE OF O HENRY'S MISQUOTATIONS OF THE CLASSICS HE LOOKS TO ME LIKE THAT ARTIST EDGAR POE IF POE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO MAKE MILLIONS LAUGH I DO NOT LIKE CHAPLIN'S WORK
4331-88349-0029 BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THE GOOD INTENTIONS AND THE ENVIABLE LAURELS LET ALL THE ART MUSEUMS INVITE HIM IN
4331-88349-0030 IF NOT A CHASTENED PERFORMER
4335-15081-0000 STOOD IN THE DILEMMA OF A DEADLY PERIL AND AN ASSURED DEATH THEY CHOSE THE FORMER AND EARLY IN MARCH BEGAN TO LEAVE THEIR ISLAND AND CROSS TO THE MAIN LAND TO GATHER WHAT SUSTENANCE THEY COULD THE ICE WAS STILL THICK
4335-15081-0001 BUT THE ADVANCING SEASON HAD SOFTENED IT AND AS A BODY OF THEM WERE CROSSING IT BROKE UNDER THEIR FEET SOME WERE DROWNED WHILE OTHERS DRAGGED THEMSELVES OUT DRENCHED AND PIERCED WITH COLD TO DIE MISERABLY ON THE FROZEN LAKE BEFORE THEY COULD REACH A SHELTER
4335-15081-0002 OTHER PARTIES MORE FORTUNATE GAINED THE SHORE SAFELY AND BEGAN THEIR FISHING
4335-15081-0003 BUT THE IROQUOIS WERE IN WAIT FOR THEM A LARGE BAND OF WARRIORS HAD ALREADY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH ICE AND SNOW FROM THEIR TOWNS IN CENTRAL NEW YORK THEY SURPRISED THE HURON FISHERMEN SURROUNDED THEM
4335-15081-0004 HAS NO INK BLACK ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE THE FURY OF THE IROQUOIS
4335-15081-0005 STILL THE GOADINGS OF FAMINE WERE RELENTLESS AND IRRESISTIBLE
4335-15081-0006 ADDS THE FATHER SUPERIOR THAT HUNGER WILL DRIVE WOLVES FROM THE FOREST SO TOO OUR STARVING HURONS WERE DRIVEN OUT OF A TOWN WHICH HAD BECOME AN ABODE OF HORROR IT WAS THE END OF LENT
4335-15081-0007 ALAS IF THESE POOR CHRISTIANS COULD HAVE HAD BUT ACORNS AND WATER TO KEEP THEIR FAST UPON ON EASTER DAY WE CAUSED THEM TO MAKE A GENERAL CONFESSION ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THEY WENT AWAY LEAVING US ALL THEIR LITTLE POSSESSIONS AND MOST OF THEM DECLARED PUBLICLY
4335-15081-0008 THAT THEY MADE US THEIR HEIRS KNOWING WELL THAT THEY WERE NEAR THEIR END AND IN FACT ONLY A FEW DAYS PASSED BEFORE WE HEARD OF THE DISASTER WHICH WE HAD FORESEEN THESE POOR PEOPLE FELL INTO AMBUSCADES OF OUR IROQUOIS ENEMIES
4335-15081-0009 SOME WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT SOME WERE DRAGGED INTO CAPTIVITY WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE BURNED A FEW MADE THEIR ESCAPE AND SPREAD DISMAY AND PANIC EVERYWHERE A WEEK AFTER ANOTHER BAND WAS OVERTAKEN BY THE SAME FATE
4335-15081-0010 TWO OF THE PRINCIPAL HURON CHIEFS CAME TO THE FORT AND ASKED AN INTERVIEW WITH RAGUENEAU AND HIS COMPANIONS THEY TOLD THEM THAT THE INDIANS HAD HELD A COUNCIL THE NIGHT BEFORE AND RESOLVED TO ABANDON THE ISLAND
4335-15081-0011 SOME WOULD DISPERSE IN THE MOST REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE FORESTS OTHERS WOULD TAKE REFUGE IN A DISTANT SPOT APPARENTLY THE GRAND MANITOULIN ISLAND
4335-15081-0012 YOU CAN SAVE US IF YOU WILL BUT RESOLVE ON A BOLD STEP CHOOSE A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN GATHER US TOGETHER AND PREVENT THIS DISPERSION OF OUR PEOPLE TURN YOUR EYES TOWARDS QUEBEC AND TRANSPORT THITHER WHAT IS LEFT OF THIS RUINED COUNTRY
4335-15081-0013 DO NOT WAIT TILL WAR AND FAMINE HAVE DESTROYED US TO THE LAST MAN WE ARE IN YOUR HANDS DEATH HAS TAKEN FROM YOU MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND OF US IF YOU WAIT LONGER NOT ONE WILL REMAIN ALIVE AND THEN YOU WILL BE SORRY THAT YOU DID NOT SAVE THOSE
4335-15081-0014 TO AN ASYLUM WHERE THERE WAS AT LEAST A HOPE OF SAFETY THEIR RESOLUTION ONCE TAKEN THEY PUSHED THEIR PREPARATIONS WITH ALL SPEED LEST THE IROQUOIS MIGHT LEARN THEIR PURPOSE AND LIE IN WAIT TO CUT THEM OFF
4335-15081-0015 CANOES WERE MADE READY AND ON THE TENTH OF JUNE THEY BEGAN THE VOYAGE WITH ALL THEIR FRENCH FOLLOWERS AND ABOUT THREE HUNDRED HURONS THE HURON MISSION WAS ABANDONED
4335-15081-0016 IT WAS NOT WITHOUT TEARS
4335-15081-0017 NOTHING REMAINING OF THE ALGONQUINS WHO DWELT ON ITS SHORE EXCEPT THE ASHES OF THEIR BURNT WIGWAMS A LITTLE FARTHER ON THERE WAS A FORT BUILT OF TREES WHERE THE IROQUOIS WHO MADE THIS DESOLATION HAD SPENT THE WINTER
4335-15081-0018 AND A LEAGUE OR TWO BELOW THERE WAS ANOTHER SIMILAR FORT THE RIVER OTTAWA WAS A SOLITUDE THE ALGONQUINS OF ALLUMETTE ISLAND AND THE SHORES ADJACENT HAD ALL BEEN KILLED OR DRIVEN AWAY NEVER AGAIN TO RETURN
4335-15081-0019 WRITES RAGUENEAU I FOUND IT BORDERED WITH ALGONQUIN TRIBES WHO KNEW NO GOD AND IN THEIR INFIDELITY THOUGHT THEMSELVES GODS ON EARTH FOR THEY HAD ALL THAT THEY DESIRED
4335-15081-0020 ABUNDANCE OF FISH AND GAME AND A PROSPEROUS TRADE WITH ALLIED NATIONS BESIDES THEY WERE THE TERROR OF THEIR ENEMIES BUT SINCE THEY HAVE EMBRACED THE FAITH AND ADORED THE CROSS OF CHRIST HE HAS GIVEN THEM A HEAVY SHARE IN THIS CROSS
4335-15081-0021 AND MADE THEM A PREY TO MISERY TORTURE AND A CRUEL DEATH IN A WORD THEY ARE A PEOPLE SWEPT FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH OUR ONLY CONSOLATION IS THAT AS THEY DIED CHRISTIANS
4335-15081-0022 IN THE PRECEDING AUTUMN BRESSANI HAD GONE DOWN TO THE FRENCH SETTLEMENTS WITH ABOUT TWENTY HURONS AND WAS NOW RETURNING WITH THEM AND TWICE THEIR NUMBER OF ARMED FRENCHMEN FOR THE DEFENCE OF THE MISSION
4335-15081-0023 HIS SCOUTS HAD ALSO BEEN ALARMED BY DISCOVERING THE FOOTPRINTS OF RAGUENEAU'S INDIANS AND FOR SOME TIME THE TWO PARTIES STOOD ON THEIR GUARD EACH TAKING THE OTHER FOR AN ENEMY WHEN AT LENGTH THEY DISCOVERED THEIR MISTAKE
4335-15081-0024 THEY MET WITH EMBRACES AND REJOICING BRESSANI AND HIS FRENCHMEN HAD COME TOO LATE ALL WAS OVER WITH THE HURONS AND THE HURON MISSION AND AS IT WAS USELESS TO GO FARTHER THEY JOINED RAGUENEAU'S PARTY AND RETRACED THEIR COURSE FOR THE SETTLEMENTS
4335-15081-0025 HUNTING FOR SUBSISTENCE AND WAITING TO WAYLAY SOME PASSING CANOE OF HURONS ALGONQUINS OR FRENCHMEN BRESSANI'S PARTY OUTNUMBERED THEM SIX TO ONE BUT THEY RESOLVED THAT IT SHOULD NOT PASS WITHOUT A TOKEN OF THEIR PRESENCE
4335-15081-0026 LATE ON A DARK NIGHT THE FRENCH AND HURONS LAY ENCAMPED IN THE FOREST SLEEPING ABOUT THEIR FIRES THEY HAD SET GUARDS BUT THESE IT SEEMS WERE DROWSY OR NEGLIGENT FOR THE TEN IROQUOIS WATCHING THEIR TIME APPROACHED WITH THE STEALTH OF LYNXES
4335-15081-0027 AND GLIDED LIKE SHADOWS INTO THE MIDST OF THE CAMP WHERE BY THE DULL GLOW OF THE SMOULDERING FIRES THEY COULD DISTINGUISH THE RECUMBENT FIGURES OF THEIR VICTIMS SUDDENLY THEY SCREECHED THE WAR WHOOP AND STRUCK LIKE LIGHTNING WITH THEIR HATCHETS AMONG THE SLEEPERS
4335-15081-0028 SEVEN WERE KILLED BEFORE THE REST COULD SPRING TO THEIR WEAPONS BRESSANI LEAPED UP AND RECEIVED ON THE INSTANT THREE ARROW WOUNDS IN THE HEAD THE IROQUOIS WERE SURROUNDED AND A DESPERATE FIGHT ENSUED IN THE DARK
4335-15081-0029 SIX OF THEM WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT AND TWO MADE PRISONERS WHILE THE REMAINING TWO BREAKING THROUGH THE CROWD BOUNDED OUT OF THE CAMP AND ESCAPED IN THE FOREST THE UNITED PARTIES SOON AFTER REACHED MONTREAL
4335-15081-0030 BUT THE HURONS REFUSED TO REMAIN IN A SPOT SO EXPOSED TO THE IROQUOIS ACCORDINGLY THEY ALL DESCENDED THE SAINT LAWRENCE AND AT LENGTH ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF JULY REACHED QUEBEC
4335-15081-0031 HERE THE URSULINES THE HOSPITAL NUNS AND THE INHABITANTS TAXED THEIR RESOURCES TO THE UTMOST
4335-15081-0032 A PARTY OF CHRISTIAN INDIANS CHIEFLY FROM SILLERY PLANNED A STROKE OF RETALIATION AND SET OUT FOR THE MOHAWK COUNTRY MARCHING CAUTIOUSLY AND SENDING FORWARD SCOUTS TO SCOUR THE FOREST
4335-15081-0033 ONE OF THESE A HURON SUDDENLY FELL IN WITH A LARGE IROQUOIS WAR PARTY AND SEEING THAT HE COULD NOT ESCAPE FORMED ON THE INSTANT A VILLANOUS PLAN TO SAVE HIMSELF HE RAN TOWARDS THE ENEMY CRYING OUT
4335-15081-0034 THAT HE HAD LONG BEEN LOOKING FOR THEM AND WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE THEM THAT HIS NATION THE HURONS HAD COME TO AN END AND THAT HENCEFORTH HIS COUNTRY WAS THE COUNTRY OF THE IROQUOIS WHERE SO MANY OF HIS KINSMEN AND FRIENDS HAD BEEN ADOPTED
4335-15081-0035 HE HAD COME HE DECLARED WITH NO OTHER THOUGHT THAN THAT OF JOINING THEM AND TURNING IROQUOIS AS THEY HAD DONE THE IROQUOIS DEMANDED IF HE HAD COME ALONE HE ANSWERED NO
4335-15081-0036 AND SAID THAT IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE HE HAD JOINED AN ALGONQUIN WAR PARTY WHO WERE IN THE WOODS NOT FAR OFF THE IROQUOIS IN GREAT DELIGHT DEMANDED TO BE SHOWN WHERE THEY WERE THIS JUDAS AS THE JESUITS CALL HIM
4335-15081-0037 AT ONCE COMPLIED AND THE ALGONQUINS WERE SURPRISED BY A SUDDEN ONSET AND ROUTED WITH SEVERE LOSS THE TREACHEROUS HURON WAS WELL TREATED BY THE IROQUOIS WHO ADOPTED HIM INTO THEIR NATION
4335-15081-0038 NOT LONG AFTER HE CAME TO CANADA AND WITH A VIEW AS IT WAS THOUGHT TO SOME FURTHER TREACHERY REJOINED THE FRENCH A SHARP CROSS QUESTIONING PUT HIM TO CONFUSION
4335-15081-0039 AND TOOK POST WAIST DEEP IN MUD AND WATER AMONG THE TALL RUSHES AT THE MARGIN OF THE RIVER HERE THEY FOUGHT STUBBORNLY AND KEPT ALL THE FRENCHMEN AT BAY AT LENGTH FINDING THEMSELVES HARD PRESSED THEY ENTERED THEIR CANOES AGAIN AND PADDLED OFF
4335-15081-0040 THE FRENCH ROWED AFTER THEM AND SOON BECAME SEPARATED IN THE CHASE WHEREUPON THE IROQUOIS TURNED AND MADE DESPERATE FIGHT WITH THE FOREMOST RETREATING AGAIN AS SOON AS THE OTHERS CAME UP
4335-15081-0041 THIS THEY REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES AND THEN MADE THEIR ESCAPE AFTER KILLING A NUMBER OF THE BEST FRENCH SOLDIERS THEIR LEADER IN THIS AFFAIR WAS A FAMOUS HALF BREED KNOWN AS THE FLEMISH BASTARD WHO IS STYLED BY RAGUENEAU
4335-15081-0042 AN ABOMINATION OF SIN AND A MONSTER PRODUCED BETWEEN A HERETIC DUTCH FATHER AND A PAGAN MOTHER IN THE FORESTS FAR NORTH OF THREE RIVERS DWELT THE TRIBE CALLED THE ATTICAMEGUES OR NATION OF THE WHITE FISH
4335-15081-0043 FROM THEIR REMOTE POSITION AND THE DIFFICULT NATURE OF THE INTERVENING COUNTRY THEY THOUGHT THEMSELVES SAFE BUT A BAND OF IROQUOIS MARCHING ON SNOW SHOES A DISTANCE OF TWENTY DAYS JOURNEY NORTHWARD FROM THE SAINT LAWRENCE
4335-15081-0044 FELL UPON ONE OF THEIR CAMPS IN THE WINTER AND MADE A GENERAL BUTCHERY OF THE INMATES THE TRIBE HOWEVER STILL HELD ITS GROUND FOR A TIME AND BEING ALL GOOD CATHOLICS GAVE THEIR MISSIONARY FATHER BUTEUX
4335-15081-0045 AN URGENT INVITATION TO VISIT THEM IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY BUTEUX WHO HAD LONG BEEN STATIONED AT THREE RIVERS WAS IN ILL HEALTH AND FOR YEARS
4335-15081-0046 GAME WAS EXCEEDINGLY SCARCE AND THEY WERE FORCED BY HUNGER TO SEPARATE A HURON CONVERT AND A FRENCHMAN NAMED FONTARABIE REMAINING WITH THE MISSIONARY THE SNOWS HAD MELTED AND ALL THE STREAMS WERE SWOLLEN
4335-15081-0047 THE THREE TRAVELLERS IN A SMALL BIRCH CANOE PUSHED THEIR WAY UP A TURBULENT RIVER WHERE FALLS AND RAPIDS WERE SO NUMEROUS THAT MANY TIMES DAILY THEY WERE FORCED TO CARRY THEIR BARK VESSEL AND THEIR BAGGAGE THROUGH FORESTS AND THICKETS
4335-15081-0048 AND OVER ROCKS AND PRECIPICES ON THE TENTH OF MAY THEY MADE TWO SUCH PORTAGES AND SOON AFTER REACHING A THIRD FALL AGAIN LIFTED THEIR CANOE FROM THE WATER THEY TOILED THROUGH THE NAKED FOREST AMONG THE WET BLACK TREES OVER TANGLED ROOTS
4335-15081-0049 GREEN SPONGY MOSSES MOULDERING LEAVES AND ROTTEN PROSTRATE TRUNKS WHILE THE CATARACT FOAMED AMIDST THE ROCKS HARD BY THE INDIAN LED THE WAY WITH THE CANOE ON HIS HEAD WHILE BUTEUX AND THE OTHER FRENCHMAN FOLLOWED WITH THE BAGGAGE
4335-15081-0050 SUDDENLY THEY WERE SET UPON BY A TROOP OF IROQUOIS WHO HAD CROUCHED BEHIND THICKETS ROCKS AND FALLEN TREES TO WAYLAY THEM THE HURON WAS CAPTURED BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO FLY
4335-15081-0051 BUTEUX AND THE FRENCHMAN TRIED TO ESCAPE BUT WERE INSTANTLY SHOT DOWN THE JESUIT RECEIVING TWO BALLS IN THE BREAST THE IROQUOIS RUSHED UPON THEM MANGLED THEIR BODIES WITH TOMAHAWKS AND SWORDS STRIPPED THEM
4335-15082-0000 HAD BEEN SHARED IN AN EQUAL DEGREE BY SMALLER BANDS WHO HAD WINTERED IN REMOTE AND SECRET RETREATS OF THE WILDERNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED THAT SEASON OF DEATH MANY WERE SO WEAKENED
4335-15082-0001 THAT THEY COULD NOT ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS OF A WANDERING LIFE WHICH WAS NEW TO THEM THE HURONS LIVED BY AGRICULTURE THEIR FIELDS AND CROPS WERE DESTROYED AND THEY WERE SO HUNTED FROM PLACE TO PLACE THAT THEY COULD RARELY TILL THE SOIL
4335-15082-0002 GAME WAS VERY SCARCE AND WITHOUT AGRICULTURE THE COUNTRY COULD SUPPORT ONLY A SCANTY AND SCATTERED POPULATION LIKE THAT WHICH MAINTAINED A STRUGGLING EXISTENCE IN THE WILDERNESS OF THE LOWER SAINT LAWRENCE
4335-15082-0003 THE MORTALITY AMONG THE EXILES WAS PRODIGIOUS IT IS A MATTER OF SOME INTEREST TO TRACE THE FORTUNES OF THE SHATTERED FRAGMENTS OF A NATION ONCE PROSPEROUS AND IN ITS OWN EYES AND THOSE OF ITS NEIGHBORS POWERFUL AND GREAT
4335-15082-0004 NONE WERE LEFT ALIVE WITHIN THEIR ANCIENT DOMAIN SOME HAD SOUGHT REFUGE AMONG THE NEUTRALS AND THE ERIES AND SHARED THE DISASTERS WHICH SOON OVERWHELMED THOSE TRIBES
4335-15082-0005 HAD RECOURSE TO AN EXPEDIENT WHICH SEEMS EQUALLY STRANGE AND DESPERATE BUT WHICH WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDIAN PRACTICES THEY CONTRIVED TO OPEN A COMMUNICATION WITH THE SENECA NATION OF THE IROQUOIS
4335-15082-0006 AND PROMISED TO CHANGE THEIR NATIONALITY AND TURN SENECAS AS THE PRICE OF THEIR LIVES THE VICTORS ACCEPTED THE PROPOSAL AND THE INHABITANTS OF THESE TWO TOWNS JOINED BY A FEW OTHER HURONS
4335-15082-0007 MIGRATED IN A BODY TO THE SENECA COUNTRY THEY WERE NOT DISTRIBUTED AMONG DIFFERENT VILLAGES BUT WERE ALLOWED TO FORM A TOWN BY THEMSELVES
4335-15082-0008 BUT AT LENGTH THEY TOO WERE COMPELLED TO FLY TOGETHER WITH SUCH OTHER HURONS AS HAD TAKEN REFUGE WITH THEM THEY MADE THEIR WAY NORTHWARD AND SETTLED ON THE ISLAND OF MICHILIMACKINAC WHERE THEY WERE JOINED BY THE OTTAWAS WHO WITH OTHER ALGONQUINS
4335-15082-0009 HAD BEEN DRIVEN BY FEAR OF THE IROQUOIS FROM THE WESTERN SHORES OF LAKE HURON AND THE BANKS OF THE RIVER OTTAWA AT MICHILIMACKINAC THE HURONS AND THEIR ALLIES WERE AGAIN ATTACKED BY THE IROQUOIS
4335-15082-0010 AND AFTER REMAINING SEVERAL YEARS THEY MADE ANOTHER REMOVE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ISLANDS AT THE MOUTH OF THE GREEN BAY OF LAKE MICHIGAN EVEN HERE THEIR OLD ENEMY DID NOT LEAVE THEM IN PEACE
4335-15082-0011 WHEREUPON THEY FORTIFIED THEMSELVES ON THE MAIN LAND AND AFTERWARDS MIGRATED SOUTHWARD AND WESTWARD THIS BROUGHT THEM IN CONTACT WITH THE ILLINOIS AN ALGONQUIN PEOPLE AT THAT TIME VERY NUMEROUS
4335-15082-0012 BUT WHO LIKE MANY OTHER TRIBES AT THIS EPOCH WERE DOOMED TO A RAPID DIMINUTION FROM WARS WITH OTHER SAVAGE NATIONS CONTINUING THEIR MIGRATION WESTWARD THE HURONS AND OTTAWAS REACHED THE MISSISSIPPI WHERE THEY FELL IN WITH THE SIOUX
4335-15082-0013 THEY SOON QUARRELLED WITH THOSE FIERCE CHILDREN OF THE PRAIRIE WHO DROVE THEM FROM THEIR COUNTRY THEY RETREATED TO THE SOUTH WESTERN EXTREMITY OF LAKE SUPERIOR AND SETTLED ON POINT SAINT ESPRIT OR SHAGWAMIGON POINT
4335-15082-0014 NEAR THE ISLANDS OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES AS THE SIOUX CONTINUED TO HARASS THEM THEY LEFT THIS PLACE ABOUT THE YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND RETURNED TO MICHILIMACKINAC WHERE THEY SETTLED NOT ON THE ISLAND BUT ON THE NEIGHBORING
4335-15082-0015 POINT SAINT IGNACE NOW GRAHAM'S POINT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE STRAIT
4335-15082-0016 WHERE A REMNANT OF THEM MAY STILL BE FOUND
4335-15082-0017 THEY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE STONE FORT WHICH THE FRENCH HAD ABANDONED AND WHERE WITH REASONABLE VIGILANCE THEY COULD MAINTAIN THEMSELVES AGAINST ATTACK IN THE SUCCEEDING AUTUMN A SMALL IROQUOIS WAR PARTY HAD THE AUDACITY TO CROSS OVER TO THE ISLAND
4335-15082-0018 AND BUILD A FORT OF FELLED TREES IN THE WOODS THE HURONS ATTACKED THEM BUT THE INVADERS MADE SO FIERCE A DEFENCE THAT THEY KEPT THEIR ASSAILANTS AT BAY AND AT LENGTH RETREATED WITH LITTLE OR NO LOSS
4335-15082-0019 SOON AFTER A MUCH LARGER BAND OF ONONDAGA IROQUOIS APPROACHING UNDISCOVERED BUILT A FORT ON THE MAIN LAND OPPOSITE THE ISLAND BUT CONCEALED FROM SIGHT IN THE FOREST HERE THEY WAITED TO WAYLAY ANY PARTY OF HURONS WHO MIGHT VENTURE ASHORE
4335-15082-0020 A HURON WAR CHIEF NAMED ETIENNE
4335-15082-0021 WHOSE LIFE IS DESCRIBED AS A SUCCESSION OF CONFLICTS AND ADVENTURES AND WHO IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN ALWAYS IN LUCK LANDED WITH A FEW COMPANIONS AND FELL INTO AN AMBUSCADE OF THE IROQUOIS
4335-15082-0022 HE PREPARED TO DEFEND HIMSELF WHEN THEY CALLED OUT TO HIM THAT THEY CAME NOT AS ENEMIES BUT AS FRIENDS AND THAT THEY BROUGHT WAMPUM BELTS AND PRESENTS TO PERSUADE THE HURONS TO FORGET THE PAST
4335-15082-0023 AND LIVE WITH THEM AS ONE NATION ETIENNE SUSPECTED TREACHERY BUT CONCEALED HIS DISTRUST AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE IROQUOIS WITH AN AIR OF THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE THEY RECEIVED HIM WITH OPEN ARMS AND PRESSED HIM TO ACCEPT THEIR INVITATION
4335-15082-0024 BUT HE REPLIED THAT THERE WERE OLDER AND WISER MEN AMONG THE HURONS WHOSE COUNSELS ALL THE PEOPLE FOLLOWED AND THAT THEY OUGHT TO LAY THE PROPOSAL BEFORE THEM HE PROCEEDED TO ADVISE THEM TO KEEP HIM AS A HOSTAGE AND SEND OVER HIS COMPANIONS WITH SOME OF THEIR CHIEFS
4335-15082-0025 TO OPEN THE NEGOTIATION HIS APPARENT FRANKNESS COMPLETELY DECEIVED THEM AND THEY INSISTED THAT HE HIMSELF SHOULD GO TO THE HURON VILLAGE WHILE HIS COMPANIONS REMAINED AS HOSTAGES HE SET OUT ACCORDINGLY WITH THREE OF THE PRINCIPAL IROQUOIS
4335-15082-0026 WHEN HE REACHED THE VILLAGE HE GAVE THE WHOOP OF ONE WHO BRINGS GOOD TIDINGS AND PROCLAIMED WITH A LOUD VOICE THAT THE HEARTS OF THEIR ENEMIES HAD CHANGED THAT THE IROQUOIS WOULD BECOME THEIR COUNTRYMEN AND BROTHERS
4335-15082-0027 AND THAT THEY SHOULD EXCHANGE THEIR MISERIES FOR A LIFE OF PEACE AND PLENTY IN A FERTILE AND PROSPEROUS LAND THE WHOLE HURON POPULATION FULL OF JOYFUL EXCITEMENT CROWDED ABOUT HIM AND THE THREE ENVOYS WHO WERE CONDUCTED TO THE PRINCIPAL LODGE AND FEASTED
4335-15082-0028 ON THE BEST THAT THE VILLAGE COULD SUPPLY ETIENNE SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ASIDE FOUR OR FIVE OF THE PRINCIPAL CHIEFS AND SECRETLY TELL THEM HIS SUSPICIONS THAT THE IROQUOIS WERE PLOTTING
4335-15082-0029 TO COMPASS THEIR DESTRUCTION UNDER COVER OF OVERTURES OF PEACE AND HE PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD MEET TREACHERY WITH TREACHERY HE THEN EXPLAINED HIS PLAN WHICH WAS HIGHLY APPROVED BY HIS AUDITORS WHO BEGGED HIM TO CHARGE HIMSELF WITH THE EXECUTION OF IT
4335-15082-0030 ETIENNE NOW CAUSED CRIERS TO PROCLAIM THROUGH THE VILLAGE THAT EVERY ONE SHOULD GET READY TO EMIGRATE IN A FEW DAYS TO THE COUNTRY OF THEIR NEW FRIENDS THE SQUAWS BEGAN THEIR PREPARATIONS AT ONCE AND ALL WAS BUSTLE AND ALACRITY
4335-15082-0031 FOR THE HURONS THEMSELVES WERE NO LESS DECEIVED THAN WERE THE IROQUOIS ENVOYS DURING ONE OR TWO SUCCEEDING DAYS MANY MESSAGES AND VISITS PASSED BETWEEN THE HURONS AND THE IROQUOIS WHOSE CONFIDENCE WAS SUCH THAT
4335-15082-0032 THIRTY SEVEN OF THEIR BEST WARRIORS AT LENGTH CAME OVER IN A BODY TO THE HURON VILLAGE ETIENNE'S TIME HAD COME HE AND THE CHIEFS WHO WERE IN THE SECRET GAVE THE WORD TO THE HURON WARRIORS WHO AT A SIGNAL RAISED THE WAR WHOOP
4335-15082-0033 RUSHED UPON THEIR VISITORS AND CUT THEM TO PIECES ONE OF THEM WHO LINGERED FOR A TIME OWNED BEFORE HE DIED THAT ETIENNE'S SUSPICIONS WERE JUST AND THAT THEY HAD DESIGNED NOTHING LESS THAN THE MASSACRE OR CAPTURE OF ALL THE HURONS
4335-15082-0034 THREE OF THE IROQUOIS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE SLAUGHTER BEGAN HAD RECEIVED FROM ETIENNE A WARNING OF THEIR DANGER IN TIME TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE THE YEAR BEFORE HE HAD BEEN CAPTURED WITH BREBEUF AND LALEMANT AT THE TOWN OF SAINT LOUIS
4335-15082-0035 WITH A BRIEF GLEAM OF JOY BUT IT BEHOOVED THEM TO MAKE A TIMELY RETREAT FROM THEIR ISLAND BEFORE THE IROQUOIS CAME TO EXACT A BLOODY RETRIBUTION TOWARDS SPRING WHILE THE LAKE WAS STILL FROZEN MANY OF THEM ESCAPED ON THE ICE WHILE ANOTHER PARTY AFTERWARDS
4335-15082-0036 FOLLOWED IN CANOES A FEW WHO HAD NEITHER STRENGTH TO WALK NOR CANOES TO TRANSPORT THEM PERFORCE REMAINED BEHIND AND WERE SOON MASSACRED BY THE IROQUOIS THE FUGITIVES DIRECTED THEIR COURSE TO THE GRAND MANITOULIN ISLAND
4335-15082-0037 WHERE THEY REMAINED FOR A SHORT TIME AND THEN TO THE NUMBER OF ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED DESCENDED THE OTTAWA AND REJOINED THEIR COUNTRYMEN WHO HAD GONE TO QUEBEC THE YEAR BEFORE THESE UNITED PARTIES JOINED FROM TIME TO TIME BY A FEW OTHER FUGITIVES
4335-15082-0038 FORMED A SETTLEMENT ON LAND BELONGING TO THE JESUITS NEAR THE SOUTH WESTERN EXTREMITY OF THE ISLE OF ORLEANS IMMEDIATELY BELOW QUEBEC
4335-15082-0039 WITH A CHAPEL AND A SMALL HOUSE FOR THE MISSIONARIES
4335-15082-0040 GRADUALLY THEY RALLIED FROM THEIR DEJECTION AND THE MISSION SETTLEMENT WAS BEGINNING TO WEAR AN APPEARANCE OF THRIFT WHEN IN SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX THE IROQUOIS MADE A DESCENT UPON THEM AND CARRIED OFF A LARGE NUMBER OF CAPTIVES
4335-15082-0041 UNDER THE VERY CANNON OF QUEBEC THE FRENCH NOT DARING TO FIRE UPON THE INVADERS LEST THEY SHOULD TAKE REVENGE UPON THE JESUITS WHO WERE AT THAT TIME IN THEIR COUNTRY
4335-15082-0042 THIS CALAMITY WAS FOUR YEARS AFTER FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER WHEN THE BEST OF THE HURON WARRIORS INCLUDING THEIR LEADER THE CRAFTY AND VALIANT ETIENNE ANNAOTAHA WERE SLAIN
4335-15082-0043 THEY AGAIN CHANGED THEIR ABODE AND UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE JESUITS WHO OWNED THE LAND SETTLED AT OLD LORETTE NINE MILES FROM QUEBEC
4335-15082-0044 WHICH AS ALL THE WORLD KNOWS IS THE HOUSE WHEREIN SAINT JOSEPH DWELT WITH HIS VIRGIN SPOUSE AND WHICH ANGELS BORE THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE HOLY LAND TO ITALY
4335-15082-0046 IT WAS BUILT OF BRICK LIKE ITS ORIGINAL OF WHICH IT WAS AN EXACT FACSIMILE AND IT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF A QUADRANGLE THE FOUR SIDES OF WHICH WERE FORMED BY THE BARK DWELLINGS OF THE HURONS RANGED WITH PERFECT ORDER IN STRAIGHT LINES
4335-15082-0047 HITHER CAME MANY PILGRIMS FROM QUEBEC AND MORE DISTANT SETTLEMENTS AND HERE OUR LADY GRANTED TO HER SUPPLIANTS
4335-15082-0048 OR INDIAN LORETTE IT WAS A WILD SPOT COVERED WITH THE PRIMITIVE FOREST AND SEAMED BY A DEEP AND TORTUOUS RAVINE WHERE THE SAINT CHARLES FOAMS
4335-15082-0049 AND WHERE THE SUNLIGHT STRUGGLES THROUGH MATTED BOUGHS OF THE PINE AND FIR TO BASK FOR BRIEF MOMENTS ON THE MOSSY ROCKS OR FLASH ON THE HURRYING WATERS ON A PLATEAU BESIDE THE TORRENT ANOTHER CHAPEL WAS BUILT TO OUR LADY
4335-15082-0050 AND ANOTHER HURON TOWN SPRANG UP AND HERE TO THIS DAY THE TOURIST FINDS THE REMNANT OF A LOST PEOPLE HARMLESS WEAVERS OF BASKETS AND SEWERS OF MOCCASINS
4356-6498-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN A VISIT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES THAT SAME AFTERNOON BALDOS BLISSFULLY IGNORANT OF THE STIR HE HAD CREATED IN CERTAIN CIRCLES
4356-6498-0001 RODE OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME AS A MEMBER OF THE CASTLE GUARD HE AND HADDAN WERE DETAILED BY COLONEL QUINNOX TO ACT AS PRIVATE ESCORT TO MISS CALHOUN UNTIL OTHERWISE ORDERED
4356-6498-0002 IF HADDAN THOUGHT HIMSELF WISER THAN BALDOS IN KNOWING THAT THEIR CHARGE WAS NOT THE PRINCESS HE WAS VERY MUCH MISTAKEN IF HE ENJOYED THE TRICK THAT WAS BEING PLAYED ON HIS FELLOW GUARDSMAN
4356-6498-0003 HIS ENJOYMENT WAS AS NOTHING AS COMPARED TO THE PLEASURE BALDOS WAS DERIVING FROM THE SITUATION THE ROYAL VICTORIA WAS DRIVEN TO THE FORTRESS CONVEYING THE SUPPOSED PRINCESS AND THE COUNTESS DAGMAR TO THE HOME OF COUNT MARLANX
4356-6498-0004 THE TWO GUARDS RODE BRAVELY BEHIND THE EQUIPAGE RESPLENDENT IN BRILLIANT NEW UNIFORMS BALDOS WAS MILDLY SURPRISED AND PUZZLED BY THE HOMAGE PAID THE YOUNG AMERICAN GIRL
4356-6498-0005 IT STRUCK HIM AS PREPOSTEROUS THAT THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF EDELWEISS COULD BE IN THE GAME TO DECEIVE HIM WHO IS THE PRINCESS'S COMPANION HE INQUIRED OF HADDAN AS THEY LEFT THE CASTLE GROUNDS
4356-6498-0006 BALDOS YOU BEHAVED VERY NICELY YESTERDAY IN EXPOSING THE DUPLICITY OF THOSE YOUNG WOMEN SHE SAID I AM HAPPY TO HAVE PLEASED YOUR HIGHNESS HE SAID STEADILY
4356-6498-0007 IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW THAT THEY CEASED TO BE LADIES IN WAITING AFTER THAT EXPOSURE YES YOUR HIGHNESS IT CERTAINLY IS INTERESTING HE SAID AS HE FELL BACK INTO POSITION BESIDE HADDAN
4356-6498-0008 DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE RIDE HE CAUGHT HIMSELF TIME AFTER TIME GAZING REFLECTIVELY AT THE BACK OF HER PROUD LITTLE HEAD POSSESSED OF AN ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE DESIRE TO TOUCH THE SOFT BROWN HAIR
4356-6498-0009 YOU CAN'T FOOL THAT EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN MUCH LONGER MY DEAR SAID THE COUNTESS RECALLING THE LOOK IN HIS DARK EYES THE SAME THOUGHT HAD BEEN AFFLICTING BEVERLY WITH ITS PROBABILITIES FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND MORE
4356-6498-0010 COUNT MARLANX WELCOMED HIS VISITORS WITH A GRACIOUSNESS THAT AWOKE WONDER IN THE MINDS OF HIS STAFF HIS MARKED PREFERENCE FOR THE AMERICAN GIRL DID NOT ESCAPE ATTENTION
4356-6498-0011 SOME OF THE BOLDER YOUNG OFFICERS INDULGED IN SURREPTITIOUS GRIMACES AND ALL LOOKED WITH MORE OR LESS COMPASSION UPON THE HAPPY FACED BEAUTY FROM OVER THE SEA MARLANX SURVEYED BALDOS STEADILY AND COLDLY
4356-6498-0012 DEEP DISAPPROVAL IN HIS SINISTER EYES HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE ENCOUNTER OF THE DAY BEFORE I SEE THE FAVORITE IS ON GUARD HE SAID BLANDLY HAS HE TOLD YOU OF THE LESSON IN MANNERS HE ENJOYED LAST NIGHT
4356-6498-0013 HE WAS LEADING HIS GUESTS TOWARD THE QUARTERS BALDOS AND HADDAN FOLLOWING THE NEW GUARD COULD NOT HELP HEARING THE SARCASTIC REMARK YOU DIDN'T HAVE HIM BEATEN CRIED BEVERLY STOPPING SHORT NO
4356-6498-0014 BALDOS HALTED NEAR BY HIS FACE WAS AS IMPASSIVE AS MARBLE HIS EYES SET STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM HIS FIGURE ERECT AND SOLDIERLY AN OCCASIONAL SARCASTIC REMARK BY THE IRON COUNT
4356-6498-0015 MEANT FOR HIS EARS MADE NO IMPRESSION UPON THE DEADLY COMPOSURE OF THE NEW GUARD WHO HAD HAD HIS LESSON MISS CALHOUN WAS CONSCIOUS OF A VAGUE FEELING THAT SHE HAD SERVED BALDOS AN ILL TURN WHEN SHE PUT HIM INTO THIS POSITION
4356-6498-0016 THE COUNT PROVIDED A LIGHT LUNCHEON IN HIS QUARTERS AFTER THE LADIES HAD GONE OVER THE FORTRESS BEVERLY CALHOUN WITH ALL OF A WOMAN'S INDIFFERENCE TO THINGS MATERIAL COULD NOT BUT SEE HOW POORLY EQUIPPED THE FORT WAS
4356-6498-0017 AS COMPARED TO THE ONES SHE HAD SEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SHE AND THE COUNTESS VISITED THE ARMORY THE ARSENAL AND THE REPAIR SHOPS BEFORE LUNCHEON RESERVING THE PLEASURES OF THE CLUBHOUSE THE OFFICERS QUARTERS
4356-6498-0018 AND THE PARADE GROUND UNTIL AFTERWARDS COUNT MARLANX'S HOME WAS IN THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE ENCLOSURE NEAR THE GATES SEVERAL OF THE OFFICERS LUNCHED WITH HIM AND THE YOUNG LADIES MARLANX WAS ASSIDUOUS IN HIS ATTENTION TO BEVERLY CALHOUN
4356-6498-0019 SO MUCH SO IN FACT THAT THE COUNTESS TEASED HER AFTERWARDS ABOUT HER CONQUEST OF THE OLD AND WELL WORN HEART BEVERLY THOUGHT HIM EXTREMELY SILLY AND SENTIMENTAL MUCH PREFERRING HIM IN THE CHARACTER OF THE HARSH IMPLACABLE MARTINET
4356-6498-0020 AT REGULAR INTERVALS SHE SAW THE STRAIGHT MARTIAL FORM OF BALDOS PASS THE WINDOW NEAR WHICH SHE SAT HE WAS PATROLLING THE NARROW PIAZZA WHICH FRONTED THE HOUSE TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE RATHER TRYING LUNCHEON
4356-6498-0021 SHE WAS ALMOST UNABLE TO CONTROL THE IMPULSE TO RUSH OUT AND COMPEL HIM TO RELAX THAT IMPOSING MACHINE LIKE STRIDE SHE HUNGERED FOR A FEW MINUTES OF THE OLD TIME FREEDOM WITH HIM
4356-6498-0022 HE HAD COLLECTED IN THE SOUTH THE LUNCHEON WAS OVER AND THE COUNTESS HAD STROLLED OFF TOWARD THE BASTIONS WITH THE YOUNG OFFICERS
4356-6498-0023 LEAVING BEVERLY ALONE WITH THE HOST SERVANTS CAME IN TO CLEAR THE TABLES BUT THE COUNT HARSHLY ORDERED THEM TO WAIT UNTIL THE GUESTS HAD DEPARTED IT IS THE DEAREST THING I HAVE SEEN SAID BEVERLY HOLDING A RARE OLD CANDLESTICK AT ARM'S LENGTH
4356-6498-0024 THE COUNT'S EYES FOLLOWED THE GRACEFUL CURVES OF HER WHITE FOREARM WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT WAS ANNOYING I PRIZE IT MORE DEARLY THAN ANY OTHER PIECE IN MY COLLECTION HE SAID IT CAME FROM ROME
4356-6498-0025 IT HAS A HISTORY WHICH I SHALL TRY TO TELL YOU SOME DAY AND WHICH MAKES IT ALMOST INVALUABLE A GERMAN NOBLEMAN OFFERED ME A SMALL FORTUNE IF I WOULD PART WITH IT AND YOU WOULDN'T SELL IT
4356-6498-0026 I WAS SAVING IT FOR AN OCCASION YOUR HIGHNESS HE SAID HIS STEELY EYES GLITTERING THE GLAD HOUR HAS COME WHEN I CAN PART WITH IT FOR A RECOMPENSE FAR GREATER THAN THE BARON'S GOLD
4356-6498-0027 OH ISN'T IT LUCKY YOU KEPT IT SHE CRIED THEN SHE TURNED HER EYES AWAY QUICKLY FOR HIS GAZE SEEMED GREEDILY ENDEAVORING TO PIERCE THROUGH THE LACE INSERTION COVERING HER NECK AND SHOULDERS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW
4356-6498-0028 THE STEADY TRAMP OF THE TALL GUARD WENT ON MONOTONOUSLY THE RECOMPENSE OF A SWEET SMILE A TENDER BLUSH AND THE UNGUARDED THANKS OF A PRETTY WOMAN THE CANDLESTICK IS YOURS MISS CALHOUN
4356-6498-0029 IF YOU WILL REPAY ME FOR MY SACRIFICE BY ACCEPTING IT WITHOUT RESERVATION SLOWLY BEVERLY CALHOUN SET THE CANDLESTICK DOWN UPON THE TABLE HER EYES MEETING HIS WITH STEADY DISDAIN
4356-6498-0030 WE MUST HURRY ALONG YOU KNOW SHE AND I HAVE PROMISED TO PLAY TENNIS WITH THE PRINCESS AT THREE O'CLOCK THE COUNT'S GLARE OF DISAPPOINTMENT LASTED BUT A MOMENT THE DIPLOMACY OF EGOTISM CAME TO HIS RELIEF
4356-6498-0031 AND HE HELD BACK THE GIFT FOR ANOTHER DAY BUT NOT FOR ANOTHER WOMAN IT GRIEVES ME TO HAVE YOU HURRY AWAY MY AFTERNOON IS TO BE A DULL ONE UNLESS YOU PERMIT ME TO WATCH THE TENNIS GAME HE SAID
4356-6498-0032 HIS EYES FOR THE MOMENT HELD HER SPELLBOUND HE WAS DRAWING THE HAND TO HIS LIPS WHEN A SHADOW DARKENED THE FRENCH WINDOW AND A SABER RATTLED WARNINGLY COUNT MARLANX LOOKED UP INSTANTLY
4356-6498-0033 A SCOWL ON HIS FACE BALDOS STOOD AT THE WINDOW IN AN ATTITUDE OF ALERT ATTENTION BEVERLY DREW HER ARM AWAY SPASMODICALLY AND TOOK A STEP TOWARD THE WINDOW THE GUARD SAW BY HER EYES THAT SHE WAS FRIGHTENED
4356-6498-0034 BUT IF HIS HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY HIS FACE WAS THE PICTURE OF MILITARY STONINESS WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE SNARLED THE COUNT DID YOUR HIGHNESS CALL

4356-6506-0001 AND THE VERY THOUGHT OF IT ALMOST SUFFOCATED HER HE WAS DRAWING THE NET WITH HIS OWN HANDS HE WAS SPYING WITH HIS OWN EYES FOR A FULL MINUTE IT SEEMED TO HER THAT HER HEART WOULD STOP BEATING HOW LONG HAD HE BEEN STANDING THERE
4356-6506-0002 WHAT HAD HE SEEN OR HEARD

4356-6506-0004 AGAIN SHE DREW STEALTHILY AWAY FROM THE RAIL POSSESSED OF A RIDICULOUS FEELING THAT HER FORM WAS AS PLAIN TO THE VISION AS IF IT WERE BROAD DAYLIGHT
4356-6506-0005 MARLANX WAS COMING TOWARD THE VERANDAH SHE FLED SWIFTLY PAUSING AT THE WINDOW TO LOWER THE FRIENDLY BUT FORGOTTEN UMBRELLA
4356-6506-0006 ONCE MORE SHE STOPPED TO LISTEN THE HIST WAS REPEATED AND THEN HER OWN NAME WAS CALLED SOFTLY BUT IMPERATIVELY IT WAS BEYOND THE POWER OF WOMAN TO KEEP FROM LAUGHING IT STRUCK HER AS
4356-6506-0007 ONCE SHE WAS INSIDE HOWEVER IT DID NOT SEEM SO AMUSING STILL IT GAVE HER AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF SATISFACTION TO SLAM THE WINDOWS LOUDLY AS IF IN PURE DEFIANCE THEN SHE CLOSED THE BLINDS
4356-6506-0008 SHUTTING OUT THE NIGHT COMPLETELY TURNING UP THE LIGHT AT HER DRESSING TABLE SHE SAT DOWN IN A STATE OF SUDDEN COLLAPSE FOR A LONG TIME SHE STARED AT HER FACE IN THE MIRROR SHE SAW THE RED OF SHAME AND EMBARRASSMENT MOUNT TO HER CHEEKS
4356-6506-0009 AND THEN SHE COVERED HER EYES WITH HER HANDS OH WHAT A FOOL YOU'VE BEEN SHE HALF SOBBED SHRINKING FROM THE MIRROR AS IF IT WERE AN ACCUSER SHE PREPARED FOR BED WITH FRANTIC HASTE
4356-6506-0010 A SHOCKING THOUGHT CAME TO HER THE NEXT SHE WAS AT THE WINDOWS AND THE SLATS WERE CLOSED WITH A RATTLE LIKE A VOLLEY OF FIREARMS THEN SHE JUMPED INTO BED SHE WONDERED IF THE WINDOWS WERE LOCKED
4356-6506-0011 IN THIS RAIN POOR FELLOW I WONDER WHERE HE IS NOW GOODNESS IT'S RAINING CATS AND DOGS BUT IN SPITE OF THE RAIN SHE COULD NOT GO TO SLEEP VAGUE FEARS BEGAN TO TAKE POSSESSION OF HER

4356-6506-0014 HER EYES FIXED UPON THE BLACK SPACE ACROSS THE ROOM FOR HOURS SHE SHIVERED AND WAITED FOR THE WINDOW TO OPEN DOZING AWAY TIME AND AGAIN ONLY TO COME BACK TO WAKEFULNESS WITH A START THE NEXT MORNING
4356-6506-0015 SHE CONFESSED TO HERSELF THAT HER FEARS HAD BEEN SILLY HER FIRST ACT AFTER BREAKFASTING ALONE IN HER ROOM WAS TO SEEK OUT COLONEL QUINNOX COMMANDER OF THE CASTLE GUARD IN HER MIND

4356-6506-0057 AND HE WANTED TO BE PERFECTLY SURE OF HIS POSITION BEFORE TAKING A STEP WHICH NOW SEEMED IMPERATIVE
4356-6506-0058 MARLANX CITED INSTANCES IN WHICH BALDOS HAD BEEN SEEN TALKING TO A STRANGE OLD MAN INSIDE THE GROUNDS AND PROFESSED TO HAVE PROOF THAT HE HAD GONE SO FAR AS TO STEAL AWAY BY NIGHT TO MEET MEN BEYOND THE CITY WALLS

4807-26853-0028 OF A ROUGH HOUSE THAT HAS EVER BEEN INVENTED THE ARE CALLED SARDINE CARS BECAUSE THE CONDUCTOR HAS TO LET THE PASSENGERS OUT WITH A CAN OPENER BRAVE AND STRONG MEN CLIMB INTO A STREET CAR AND THEY ARE FULL OF HEALTH AND LIFE AND VIGOR
4807-26853-0029 BUT A FEW BLOCKS UP THE ROAD THEY FALL OUT BACKWARDS AND INQUIRE FEEBLY FOR A SANITARIUM TO RIDE ON THE STREET CARS IN A BIG CITY OF AN EVENING BRINGS OUT ALL THAT IS IN A MAN INCLUDING A LOT OF LOUD WORDS HE DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD

4807-26853-0034 IN THE STREET CARS IN GERMANY WE FIND GERMANS IN THE CARS BUT IN AMERICA WE FIND GERMS THAT IS BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY IS YOUNG AND IMPULSIVE
4807-26853-0035 BECAUSE THE LAW SAYS WE MUST NOT BE DISRESPECTFUL TO THE DUMB BRUTES OF THE FIELD MANY OF OUR STREET CARS ARE MADE OUT OF THE SAME IDEA AS A CAN OF CONDENSED MILK THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE STREET CARS HAVE A SOUR TASTE LIKE A LEMON SQUEEZER WHEN YOU GET OUT

4807-26853-0039 TO PROVE HOW CARELESS WE ARE I WILL CITE THE FACT THAT MANHATTAN ISLAND IS CALLED AFTER A COCKTAIL THIS NERVOUSNESS IS OUR UNDOING BECAUSE WE ARE ALWAYS IN SUCH A HURRY TO GET SOMEWHERE THAT WE WOULD RATHER TAKE THE FIRST CAR AND GET SQUEEZED INTO BREATHLESSNESS
4807-26853-0040 THAN WAIT FOR THE NEXT WHICH WOULD LIKELY SQUEEZE US INTO INSENSIBILITY BREATHLESSNESS CAN BE CURED BUT INSENSIBILITY IS DANGEROUS WITHOUT AN ALARM CLOCK FOR A MAN WITH A SMALL DINING ROOM THE SARDINE CAR HAS ITS ADVANTAGES
4807-26853-0041 BUT WHEN A STOUT MAN RIDES IN THEM HE FINDS HIMSELF SUPPORTING A LOT OF STRANGERS HE NEVER MET BEFORE ONE MORNING I JUMPED ON ONE OF THOSE SARDINE CARS FEELING JUST LIKE A TWO YEAR OLD FULL OF HEALTH AND HAPPINESS DURING THE FIRST SEVEN BLOCKS
4807-26853-0042 THREE MEN FRESH FROM A DISTILLERY GREW UP IN FRONT OF ME AND REMOVED THE SCENERY ONE OF THEM HAD TO GET OUT IN A HURRY SO HE KICKED ME ON THE SHINS TO SHOW HOW SORRY HE WAS TO LEAVE ME ONE OF THE OTHER TWO MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE DISTILLERY A LONG TIME BECAUSE PRETTY SOON HE NEGLECTED TO USE HIS MEMORY AND SAT DOWN IN MY LAP
4807-26853-0043 WHEN I REMONSTRATED WITH HIM HE REPLIED THAT THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY AND IF HE WISHED TO SIT DOWN I HAD NO BUSINESS TO STOP HIM THEN HIS FRIEND PULLED US APART AND I RESUMED THE USE OF MY LAP
4807-26853-0044 DURING THE NEXT TWENTY BLOCKS I HAD ONE OF THE WORST DAYLIGHT NIGHTMARES I EVER RODE BEHIND THE PARTY WHICH HAD BEEN STUDYING THE EXHIBITS IN THE DISTILLERY GOT THE IDEA IN HIS HEAD THAT MY FOOT WAS THE LOUD PEDAL ON A PIANO AND HE STARTED TO PLAY THE OVERTURE FROM WILLIAM TELL UNTIL I YELLED
4807-26853-0045 THEN I JUMPED OFF AND SWORE OFF AND SWORE AT AND WALKED HOME IF THE MAN WHO INVENTED THE IDEA OF STANDING UP BETWEEN THE SEATS IN A SARDINE CAR IS ALIVE HE SHOULD HAVE A MONUMENT

4837-285896-0007 I WONDER THAT YOUR CONSCIENCE ALLOWS YOU TO SHIRK YOUR PART OF THE DUTY AND LEAVE ALL THE TIRESOME ENTERTAINING TO BE DONE BY ME SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH WIDE OPENED EYES AND A CONCERNED FACE
4837-285896-0008 ALICE WAS ALWAYS SO PAINFULLY LITERAL
4837-285896-0009 SHE EXCLAIMED I WAS IN AN EVIL MOOD AND I DETERMINED TO SHOCK HER IT WAS NEVER A DIFFICULT TASK SO I DO SOMETIMES I ANSWERED BUT TO DAY MY CALLERS HAVE BEEN ALL WOMEN
4837-285896-0010 WINDING UP WITH AN HOUR AND A HALF OF LADY NASELTON ONE GETS SO TIRED OF ONE'S OWN SEX NOT A SINGLE MAN ALL THE AFTERNOON SOMEBODY ELSE'S HUSBAND TO PASS THE BREAD AND BUTTER WOULD HAVE BEEN A GODSEND
4837-285896-0011 ALICE PURSED UP HER LIPS AND TURNED HER HEAD AWAY WITH A LOOK OF DISPLEASURE I AM SURPRISED TO HEAR YOU TALK LIKE THAT KATE SHE SAID QUIETLY DO YOU THINK THAT IT IS QUITE GOOD TASTE
4837-285896-0012 BE OFF YOU LITTLE GOOSE I CALLED AFTER HER AS SHE PASSED ON TOWARDS THE HOUSE WITH QUICKENED STEP AND RIGID HEAD THE LITTLE SOBER FIGURE TURNED THE BEND AND DISAPPEARED WITHOUT LOOKING AROUND SHE WAS THE PERFECT TYPE OF A CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER
4837-285896-0013 STUDIOUSLY CONVENTIONAL UNREMITTINGLY PROPER INEVITABLY A LITTLE PRIGGISH SHE WAS THE RIGHT PERSON IN THE RIGHT PLACE SHE HAD THE SUPREME GOOD FORTUNE TO BE IN ACCORD WITH HER ENVIRONMENT
4837-285896-0014 I LOOKED AFTER HER AND SIGHED
4837-285896-0015 ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WAS NOTHING TO STAY OUT FOR I HESITATED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN STROLLED ON TO THE END OF THE AVENUE A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER SEEMED IMMINENT
4837-285896-0016 A GREY MURKY TWILIGHT HAD FOLLOWED THE AFTERNOON OF BRILLIANT SUNSHINE AND A LOW SOUTH WIND WAS MOANING AMONGST THE NORWEGIAN FIRS I LEANED OVER THE GATE WITH MY FACE TURNED TOWARDS THE GREAT INDISTINCT FRONT OF DEVILLE COURT
4837-285896-0017 THERE WAS NOTHING TO LOOK AT THE TREES HAD TAKEN TO THEMSELVES FANTASTIC SHAPES LITTLE WREATHS OF WHITE MIST WERE RISING FROM THE HOLLOWS OF THE PARK THE LANDSCAPE WAS GREY COLORLESS MONOTONOUS
4837-285896-0018 MY WHOLE LIFE WAS LIKE THAT I THOUGHT WITH A SUDDEN DESPONDENT CHILL THE LIVES OF MOST GIRLS MUST BE UNLESS THEY ARE DOMESTIC IN OUR LITTLE FAMILY ALICE ABSORBED THE DOMESTICITY
4837-285896-0019 I REALIZED WITH A START THAT I WAS BECOMING MORBID AND TURNED FROM THE GATE TOWARDS THE HOUSE SUDDENLY I HEARD AN UNEXPECTED SOUND THE SOUND OF VOICES CLOSE AT HAND
4837-285896-0020 I STOPPED SHORT AND HALF TURNED ROUND A DEEP VOICE RANG OUT UPON THE STILL DAMP AIR GET OVER MADAM GET OVER MARVEL
4837-285896-0021 THERE WAS THE SOUND OF THE CRACKING OF A WHIP AND THE SOFT PATTER OF DOGS FEET AS THEY CAME ALONG THE LANE BELOW A NARROW THOROUGHFARE WHICH WAS BOUNDED ON ONE SIDE BY OUR WALL AND ON THE OTHER
4837-285896-0022 BY THE OPEN STRETCH OF PARK AT THE HEAD OF WHICH STOOD DEVILLE COURT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE TWENTY OF THEM ALL OF THE SAME BREED BEAGLES AND AMONGST THEM TWO PEOPLE WERE WALKING A MAN AND A WOMAN
4837-285896-0023 THE MAN WAS NEAREST TO ME AND I COULD SEE HIM MORE DISTINCTLY HE WAS TALL AND VERY BROAD WITH A RAGGED BEARD AND LONG HAIR HE WORE NO COLLAR AND THERE WAS A GREAT RENT IN HIS SHABBY SHOOTING COAT
4837-285896-0024 OF HIS FEATURES I COULD SEE NOTHING HE WORE KNICKERBOCKERS AND STOCKINGS AND THICK SHOES HE WAS BY NO MEANS AN ORDINARY LOOKING PERSON BUT HE WAS CERTAINLY NOT PREPOSSESSING
4837-285896-0025 THE MOST FAVORABLE THING ABOUT HIM WAS HIS CARRIAGE WHICH WAS UPRIGHT AND EASY BUT EVEN THAT WAS IN A MEASURE SPOILED BY A DISTINCT SUGGESTION OF SURLINESS
4837-285896-0026 THE WOMAN BY HIS SIDE I COULD ONLY SEE VERY INDISTINCTLY SHE WAS SLIM AND WORE SOME SORT OF A PLAIN TAILOR GOWN BUT SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE YOUNG
4837-285896-0027 STANDING FOR A MOMENT IN THE SHADOW OF A TALL LAUREL BUSH I WAS NOT SEEN BUT I COULD HEAR THEIR VOICES THE WOMAN WAS SPEAKING A NEW VICAR OR CURATE IN CHARGE HERE ISN'T THERE BRUCE
4837-285896-0028 I FANCY I HEARD THAT ONE WAS EXPECTED A SULLEN IMPATIENT GROWL CAME FROM HER SIDE
4837-285896-0029 THE PARSON WAS BOUND TO COME I SUPPOSE BUT WHAT THE MISCHIEF DOES HE WANT WITH A DAUGHTER A LITTLE LAUGH FROM THE WOMAN A PLEASANT MUSICAL LAUGH DAUGHTERS I BELIEVE I HEARD SOME ONE SAY THAT THERE WERE TWO
4837-285896-0030 WHAT A MISOGYNIST YOU ARE GETTING WHY SHOULDN'T THE MAN HAVE DAUGHTERS IF HE LIKES I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE TWO OF THEM THERE WAS A CONTEMPTUOUS SNORT AND A MOMENT'S SILENCE
4837-285896-0031 THEY WERE EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO ME NOW BUT THE HEDGE AND THE SHADOW OF THE LAURELS BENEATH WHICH I WAS STANDING COMPLETELY SHIELDED ME FROM OBSERVATION THE MAN'S HUGE FORM STOOD OUT WITH ALMOST STARTLING DISTINCTNESS
4837-285896-0032 AGAINST THE GREY SKY HE WAS LASHING THE THISTLES BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH HIS LONG WHIP MAYBE HE GROWLED
4837-285896-0033 A PALE FACED BLACK HAIRED CHIT I SMOTHERED A LAUGH I WAS THE PALE FACED BLACK HAIRED CHIT BUT IT WAS SCARCELY A POLITE WAY OF ALLUDING TO ME MISTER BRUCE DEVILLE
4837-285896-0034 WHEN THEY HAD GONE BY I LEANED OVER THE GATE AGAIN AND WATCHED THEM VANISH AMONGST THE SHADOWS THE SOUND OF THEIR VOICES CAME TO ME INDISTINCTLY BUT I COULD HEAR THE DEEP BASS OF THE MAN AS HE SLUNG SOME SCORNFUL EXCLAMATION
4837-285896-0035 OUT UPON THE MOIST AIR HIS GREAT FIGURE LOOMING UNNATURALLY LARGE THROUGH THE MISTY TWILIGHT WAS THE LAST TO VANISH IT WAS MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF MISTER BRUCE DEVILLE OF DEVILLE COURT
4837-285896-0036 I TURNED ROUND WITH A TERRIFIED START ALMOST AT MY SIDE SOME HEAVY BODY HAD FALLEN TO THE GROUND WITH A FAINT GROAN A SINGLE STEP AND I WAS BENDING OVER THE PROSTRATE FORM OF A MAN
4837-285896-0037 I CAUGHT HIS HAND AND GAZED INTO HIS FACE WITH HORRIFIED EYES IT WAS MY FATHER HE MUST HAVE BEEN WITHIN A YARD OF ME WHEN HE FELL HIS EYES WERE HALF CLOSED AND HIS HANDS WERE COLD
4837-285896-0038 GATHERING UP MY SKIRTS IN MY HAND I RAN SWIFTLY ACROSS THE LAWN INTO THE HOUSE I MET ALICE IN THE HALL GET SOME BRANDY I CRIED BREATHLESSLY FATHER IS ILL OUT IN THE GARDEN QUICK SHE BROUGHT IT IN A MOMENT
4837-285896-0039 TOGETHER WE HURRIED BACK TO WHERE I HAD LEFT HIM HE HAD NOT MOVED HIS CHEEKS WERE GHASTLY PALE AND HIS EYES WERE STILL CLOSED I FELT HIS PULSE AND HIS HEART AND UNFASTENED HIS COLLAR
4837-285896-0040 THERE IS NOTHING SERIOUS THE MATTER AT LEAST I THINK NOT I WHISPERED TO ALICE IT IS ONLY A FAINTING FIT I RUBBED HIS HANDS AND WE FORCED SOME BRANDY BETWEEN HIS LIPS
4837-285896-0041 PRESENTLY HE OPENED HIS EYES AND RAISED HIS HEAD A LITTLE LOOKING HALF FEARFULLY AROUND IT WAS HER VOICE HE WHISPERED HOARSELY IT CAME TO ME THROUGH THE SHADOWS WHERE IS SHE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HER
4837-285896-0042 THERE WAS A RUSTLING OF THE LEAVES AND THEN I HEARD HER SPEAK THERE IS NO ONE HERE BUT ALICE AND MYSELF I SAID BENDING OVER HIM YOU MUST HAVE BEEN FANCYING THINGS ARE YOU BETTER BETTER
4837-285896-0043 HE LOOKED UP AT BOTH OF US AND THE LIGHT CAME BACK INTO HIS FACE AH I SEE I MUST HAVE FAINTED HE EXCLAIMED I REMEMBER THE STUDY WAS CLOSE AND I CAME TO GET COOL YET I THOUGHT I THOUGHT
4837-285896-0044 I HELD OUT MY ARM AND HE STAGGERED UP HE WAS STILL WHITE AND SHAKEN BUT EVIDENTLY HIS MEMORY WAS RETURNING I REMEMBER IT WAS CLOSE IN THE STUDY HE SAID VERY CLOSE I WAS TIRED TOO
4837-285896-0045 I MUST HAVE WALKED TOO FAR I DON'T LIKE IT THOUGH I MUST SEE A DOCTOR I MUST CERTAINLY SEE A DOCTOR ALICE BENT OVER HIM FULL OF SYMPATHY AND HE TOOK HER ARM I WALKED BEHIND HIM IN SILENCE
4837-285896-0046 A CURIOUS THOUGHT HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF ME I COULD NOT GET RID OF THE IMPRESSION OF MY FATHER'S FIRST WORDS AND HIS WHITE TERRIFIED FACE WAS IT INDEED A WILD FANCY OF HIS
4837-285896-0047 OR HAD HE REALLY HEARD THIS VOICE WHICH HAD STIRRED HIM SO DEEPLY I TRIED TO LAUGH AT THE IDEA I COULD NOT HIS CRY WAS SO NATURAL HIS TERROR SO APPARENT HE HAD HEARD A VOICE
4837-285896-0048 HE HAD BEEN STRICKEN WITH A SUDDEN TERROR WHOSE WAS THE VOICE WHENCE HIS FEAR OF IT I WATCHED HIM LEANING SLIGHTLY UPON ALICE'S ARM AND WALKING ON SLOWLY IN FRONT OF ME TOWARDS THE HOUSE
4837-285896-0049 ALREADY HE WAS BETTER HIS FEATURES HAD REASSUMED THEIR CUSTOMARY AIR OF DELICATE AND RESERVED STRENGTH I LOOKED AT HIM WITH NEW AND CURIOUS EYES FOR THE FIRST TIME I WONDERED
4837-302000-0000 MISSUS MC LANE HAD CALLED ON MISSUS TALBOT THAT WAS KNOWN TO ALL SAN FRANCISCO FOR HER CARRIAGE HAD STOOD IN FRONT OF THE OCCIDENTAL HOTEL FOR AN HOUR KIND FRIENDS HAD CALLED TO OFFER THEIR SERVICES IN SETTING THE NEW HOUSE IN ORDER
4837-302000-0001 BUT WERE DISMISSED AT THE DOOR WITH THE BRIEF ANNOUNCEMENT THAT MISSUS MC LANE WAS HAVING THE BLUES NO ONE WASTED TIME ON A SECOND EFFORT TO GOSSIP WITH THEIR LEADER IT WAS KNOWN THAT JUST SO OFTEN MISSUS MC LANE
4837-302000-0002 DREW DOWN THE BLINDS INFORMED HER HOUSEHOLD THAT SHE WAS NOT TO BE DISTURBED DISPOSED HERSELF ON THE SOFA WITH HER BACK TO THE ROOM AND INDULGED IN THE LUXURY OF BLUES FOR THREE DAYS
4837-302000-0003 SHE TOOK NO NOURISHMENT BUT MILK AND BROTH AND SPOKE TO NO ONE TODAY THIS WOULD BE A REST CURE AND WAS EQUALLY BENEFICIAL WHEN THE ATTACK WAS OVER MISSUS MC LANE WOULD ARISE WITH A CLEAR COMPLEXION
4837-302000-0004 SERENE NERVES AND RENEWED STRENGTH FOR SOCIAL DUTIES HER FRIENDS KNEW THAT HER RETIREMENT ON THIS OCCASION WAS TIMED TO FINISH ON THE MORNING OF HER RECEPTION
4837-302000-0005 AND HAD NOT THE LEAST MISGIVING THAT HER DOORS WOULD STILL BE CLOSED THE GREAT DOUBLE PARLORS OF HER NEW MANSION WERE THROWN INTO ONE AND THE SIMPLE FURNITURE COVERED WITH GRAY REP WAS PUSHED AGAINST SOFT GRAY WALLS
4837-302000-0006 HUNG WITH SEVERAL OLD PORTRAITS IN OIL FERROTYPES AND SILHOUETTES A MAGNIFICENT CRYSTAL CHANDELIER DEPENDED FROM THE HIGH AND LIGHTLY FRESCOED CEILING AND THERE WERE SIDE BRACKETS BESIDE THE DOORS
4837-302000-0007 AND THE LOW MANTEL PIECE MISSUS MC LANE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE BEAUTY WITH THE AID OF THE SAN FRANCISCO SHOPS BUT AT LEAST SHE HAD MANAGED TO GIVE HER ROOMS A SEVERE AND STATELY SIMPLICITY
4837-302000-0008 VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE HELPLESS SURRENDERS OF HER FRIENDS TO MID VICTORIAN DEFORMITIES THE ROOMS FILLED EARLY MISSUS MC LANE STOOD BEFORE THE NORTH WINDOWS RECEIVING HER FRIENDS WITH HER USUAL BRILLIANT SMILE
4837-302000-0009 HER MANNER OF HIGH DIGNITY AND SWEET CORDIALITY
4837-302000-0010 AND INCREASING CURVES FOR THE MAJESTY WAS WITHIN AND HER HEAD ABOVE A FLAT BACK HAD A LOFTY POISE SHE WORE HER PREMATURELY WHITE HAIR IN A TALL POMPADOUR
4837-302000-0011 AND THIS WITH THE RICH VELVETS SHE AFFECTED AMPLE AND LONG MADE HER LOOK LIKE A FRENCH MARQUISE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY STEPPED DOWN FROM THE CANVAS THE EFFECT WAS BY NO MEANS ACCIDENTAL
4837-302000-0012 MISSUS MC LANE'S GRANDMOTHER HAD BEEN FRENCH AND SHE RESEMBLED HER HER HOOPSKIRT WAS SMALL BUT THE OTHER WOMEN WERE INCLINED TO THE EXTREME OF THE FASHION
4837-302000-0013 THEY OR THEIR DRESSMAKERS SUBSCRIBED TO THEIR HANDSOME GOWNS SPREAD WIDELY AND THE ROOMS HARDLY COULD HAVE SEEMED TO SWAY AND UNDULATE MORE IF AN EARTHQUAKE HAD ROCKED IT
4837-302000-0014 THE OLDER WOMEN WORE SMALL BONNETS AND CASHMERE SHAWLS LACE COLLARS AND CAMEOS
4837-302000-0015 THE HUSBANDS HAD RETIRED WITH MISTER MC LANE TO THE SMOKING ROOM
4837-302000-0016 UNLIKE AS A RECEPTION OF THAT DAY WAS IN BACKGROUND AND COSTUMES FROM THE REFINEMENTS OF MODERN ART AND TASTE IT POSSESSED ONE CONTRAST THAT WAS WHOLLY TO ITS ADVANTAGE
4837-302000-0017 ITS MEN WERE GENTLEMEN AND THE SONS AND GRANDSONS OF GENTLEMEN
4837-302000-0018 AMBITIOUS TO PUSH AHEAD IN POLITICS OR THE PROFESSIONS AND APPRECIATING THE IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE NEW AND FAMOUS CITY OR LEFT WITH AN INSUFFICIENT INHERITANCE PARTICULARLY AFTER THE WAR
4837-302000-0019 AND ASHAMED TO WORK IN COMMUNITIES WHERE NO GENTLEMAN HAD EVER WORKED
4837-302000-0020 IF HE DID NOT OCCUPY HIMSELF LUCRATIVELY WAS UNFIT FOR THE SOCIETY OF ENTERPRISING CITIZENS FEW HAD COME IN TIME FOR THE GOLD DIGGINGS BUT ALL
4837-302000-0021 UNLESS THEY HAD DISAPPEARED INTO THE HOT INSATIABLE MAW OF THE WICKED LITTLE CITY HAD SUCCEEDED IN ONE FIELD OR ANOTHER AND THESE IN THEIR DANDIFIED CLOTHES MADE A FINE APPEARANCE AT FASHIONABLE GATHERINGS
4837-302000-0022 IF THEY TOOK UP LESS ROOM THAN THE WOMEN THEY CERTAINLY WERE MORE DECORATIVE DOCTOR TALBOT AND HIS WIFE HAD NOT ARRIVED TO ALL EAGER QUESTIONS MISSUS MC LANE MERELY REPLIED THAT THEY WOULD
4837-302000-0023 BE HERE SHE HAD THE DRAMATIC INSTINCT OF THE TRUE LEADER AND HAD COMMANDED THE DOCTOR NOT TO BRING HIS BRIDE BEFORE FOUR O'CLOCK THE RECEPTION BEGAN AT THREE THEY SHOULD HAVE AN ENTRANCE
4837-302000-0024 BUT MISSUS ABBOTT A LADY OF THREE CHINS AND AN EAGLE EYE WHO HAD CLUNG FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO BLACK SATIN AND BUGLES WAS TOO PERSISTENT TO BE DENIED
4837-302000-0025 SHE EXTRACTED THE INFORMATION THAT THE BOSTONIAN HAD SENT HER OWN FURNITURE BY A PREVIOUS STEAMER AND THAT HER DRAWING ROOM WAS GRACEFUL FRENCH AND EXQUISITE
4837-302000-0026 AT TEN MINUTES AFTER THE HOUR THE BUZZ AND CHATTER STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND EVERY FACE WAS TURNED EVERY NECK CRANED TOWARD THE DOOR THE COLORED BUTLER HAD ANNOUNCED WITH A GRAND FLOURISH
4837-302000-0027 DOCTOR AND MISSUS TALBOT THE DOCTOR LOOKED AS RUBICUND AS JOVIAL AS CYNICAL AS EVER BUT FEW CAST HIM MORE THAN A PASSING GLANCE THEN THEY GAVE AN AUDIBLE GASP
4837-302000-0028 INDUCED BY AN INGENUOUS COMPOUND OF AMAZEMENT DISAPPOINTMENT AND ADMIRATION THEY HAD BEEN PREPARED TO FORGIVE TO ENDURE TO MAKE EVERY ALLOWANCE
4837-302000-0029 THE POOR THING COULD NO MORE HELP BEING PLAIN AND DOWDY THAN BORN IN BOSTON AND AS THEIR LEADER HAD SATISFIED HERSELF THAT SHE WOULD DO THEY WOULD NEVER LET HER KNOW HOW DEEPLY THEY DEPLORED HER DISABILITIES
4837-302000-0030 BUT THEY FOUND NOTHING TO DEPLORE BUT THE AGONIZING NECESSITY FOR IMMEDIATE READJUSTMENT MISSUS TALBOT WAS UNQUESTIONABLY A PRODUCT OF THE BEST SOCIETY THE SOUTH COULD HAVE DONE NO BETTER
4837-302000-0031 SHE WAS TALL AND SUPPLE AND SELF POSSESSED SHE WAS EXQUISITELY DRESSED IN DARK BLUE VELVET WITH A HIGH COLLAR OF POINT LACE TAPERING ALMOST TO HER BUST AND REVEALING A LONG WHITE THROAT
4837-302000-0032 CLASPED AT THE BASE BY A STRING OF PEARLS ON HER HEAD AS PROUDLY POISED AS MISSUS MC LANE'S WAS A BLUE VELVET HAT HIGHER IN THE CROWN THAN THE PREVAILING FASHION
4837-302000-0033 ROLLED UP ON ONE SIDE AND TRIMMED ONLY WITH A DROOPING GRAY FEATHER AND HER FIGURE HER FACE HER PROFILE THE YOUNG MEN CROWDED FORWARD MORE SWIFTLY THAN THE STILL ALMOST PARALYZED WOMEN
4837-302000-0034 SHE WAS NO MORE THAN TWENTY HER SKIN WAS AS WHITE AS THE SAN FRANCISCO FOGS HER LIPS WERE SCARLET HER CHEEKS PINK HER HAIR AND EYES A BRIGHT GOLDEN BROWN
4837-302000-0035 HER FEATURES WERE DELICATE AND REGULAR THE MOUTH NOT TOO SMALL CURVED AND SENSITIVE HER REFINEMENT WAS ALMOST EXCESSIVE OH SHE WAS HIGH TONED NO DOUBT OF THAT
4837-302000-0036 AS SHE MOVED FORWARD AND STOOD IN FRONT OF MISSUS MC LANE OR ACKNOWLEDGED INTRODUCTIONS TO THOSE THAT STOOD NEAR THE WOMEN GAVE ANOTHER GASP THIS TIME OF CONSTERNATION
4837-302000-0037 SHE WORE NEITHER HOOP SKIRT NOR CRINOLINE COULD IT BE THAT THE MOST ELEGANT FASHION EVER INVENTED HAD BEEN DISCARDED BY PARIS OR WAS THIS LOVELY CREATURE OF SURPASSING ELEGANCE A LAW UNTO HERSELF
4837-302000-0038 HER SKIRT WAS FULL BUT STRAIGHT AND DID NOT DISGUISE THE LINES OF HER GRACEFUL FIGURE ABOVE HER SMALL WAIST IT FITTED AS CLOSELY AS A RIDING HABIT SHE WAS EVEN MORE BECOMINGLY
4837-302000-0039 DRESSED THAN ANY WOMAN IN THE ROOM MISSUS ABBOTT WHO WAS GIVEN TO PRIMITIVE SOUNDS SNORTED MARIA BALLINGER WHOSE FINELY DEVELOPED FIGURE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN THE TRUNK OF A TREE SNIFFED
4837-302000-0040 HER SISTER SALLY ALMOST DANCED WITH EXCITEMENT AND EVEN MISS HATHAWAY STRAIGHTENED HER FICHU MISSUS BALLINGER WHO HAD BEEN THE BELLE OF RICHMOND AND WAS STILL ADJUDGED THE HANDSOMEST WOMAN IN SAN FRANCISCO
4837-302000-0041 LIFTED THE EYEBROWS TO WHICH SONNETS HAD BEEN WRITTEN WITH AN AIR OF HAUGHTY RESIGNATION BUT MADE UP HER MIND TO ABATE HER SCORN OF THE NORTH AND ORDER HER GOWNS FROM NEW YORK HEREAFTER BUT THE SAN FRANCISCANS
4837-302000-0042 IN A FEW MOMENTS THEY FELT A PLEASANT TITILLATION OF THE NERVES AS IF THE GREAT WORLD THEY MIGHT NEVER SEE AGAIN HAD SENT THEM ONE OF HER MOST PRECIOUS GIFTS THEY ALL MET HER IN THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON
4837-302000-0043 SHE WAS SWEET AND GRACIOUS BUT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NOT A HINT OF EMBARRASSMENT SHE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO SHINE AND THEY LIKED HER THE BETTER FOR THAT THE YOUNG MEN SOON DISCOVERED THEY COULD MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON THIS LOVELY IMPORTATION
4837-302000-0044 FOR HER EYES STRAYED CONSTANTLY TO HER HUSBAND UNTIL HE DISAPPEARED IN SEARCH OF CRONIES WHISKEY AND A CIGAR THEN SHE LOOKED DEPRESSED FOR A MOMENT BUT GAVE A STILL CLOSER ATTENTION TO THE WOMEN ABOUT HER
4837-302000-0045 IN LOVE WITH HER HUSBAND BUT A WOMAN OF THE WORLD MANNERS AS FINE AS MISSUS MC LANE'S BUT TOO ALOOF AND SENSITIVE TO CARE FOR LEADERSHIP SHE HAD MADE THE GRAND TOUR IN EUROPE THEY DISCOVERED
4837-302000-0046 AND ENJOYED A SEASON IN WASHINGTON SHE SHOULD CONTINUE TO LIVE AT THE OCCIDENTAL HOTEL AS HER HUSBAND WOULD BE OUT SO MUCH AT NIGHT AND SHE WAS RATHER TIMID AND SHE WAS BRIGHT UNAFFECTED RESPONSIVE
4837-302000-0047 COULD ANYTHING BE MORE REASSURING THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE APPREHENDED BY THE SOCIALLY AMBITIOUS THE PROUD HOUSEWIVES
4837-302000-0049 IN SHORT THEY ALL TOOK HER TO THEIR HEARTS SHE WAS ONE OF THEM FROM THAT TIME FORTH
4839-15304-0000 THE TITLES OF KING OF NAPLES AND OF JERUSALEM AND DUKE OF MILAN
4839-15304-0001 THAT HE WOULD PURSUE A PACIFIC AND CONSERVATIVE POLICY AT HOME AND A WARLIKE AND ADVENTUROUS POLICY ABROAD
4839-15304-0002 HAD BY HIS SAGACITY AND FERTILE MIND BY HIS TASTE FOR ARTS AND SCIENCES AND THE INTELLIGENT PATRONAGE HE BESTOWED UPON THEM BY HIS ABILITY IN SPEAKING AND BY HIS FACILE CHARACTER OBTAINED IN ITALY A POSITION FAR BEYOND HIS REAL POWER
4839-15304-0003 AND TESTIFYING GREAT GOOD WILL AND THE SPECIAL COURIER WHO BROUGHT IT DECLARED THAT THE KING HAD WRITTEN TO NOBODY IN ITALY EXCEPT THE POPE THE VENETIANS AND THE FLORENTINES THE VENETIANS DID NOT CARE TO NEGLECT SUCH AN OPENING
4839-15304-0004 BUT AT THE FOUNTAIN INN YOU WILL TELL ME THAT SO GREAT A KING OUGHT NOT TO PUT UP AT AN INN BUT I SHALL ANSWER YOU THAT IN THIS DISTRICT OF ETAMPES THE BEST HOUSES ARE AS YET THE INNS THERE IS CERTAINLY A ROYAL CASTLE IN THE WHICH LIVES THE QUEEN THE WIFE OF THE DECEASED KING
4839-15304-0005 NEVERTHELESS HIS MAJESTY WAS PLEASED TO GIVE AUDIENCE IN THIS HOSTELRY ALL COVERED EXPRESSLY WITH CLOTH OF ALEXANDRINE VELVET WITH LILIES OF GOLD AT THE SPOT WHERE THE KING WAS PLACED AS SOON AS THE SPEECH WAS ENDED
4839-15304-0006 AS HIS RIGHTFUL AND OLDEN PATRIMONY AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE CHARGES AND EXPENSES WHICH WOULD BE INCURRED BY THE VENETIAN GOVERNMENT WHILST RENDERING ASSISTANCE TO THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING IN THE AFORESAID WAR THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING BOUND HIMSELF TO APPROVE AND CONSENT THAT THE CITY OF CREMONA
4839-15304-0007 AND CERTAIN FORTS OR TERRITORIES ADJACENT SPECIALLY INDICATED SHOULD BELONG IN FREEHOLD AND PERPETUITY TO THE VENETIAN GOVERNMENT THE TREATY AT THE SAME TIME REGULATED THE NUMBER OF TROOPS AND THE MILITARY DETAILS OF THE WAR ON BEHALF OF THE TWO CONTRACTING POWERS
4839-15304-0008 AND IT PROVIDED FOR DIVERS POLITICAL INCIDENTS WHICH MIGHT BE ENTAILED AND TO WHICH THE ALLIANCE THUS CONCLUDED SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE APPLICABLE ACCORDING TO THE SPECIAL STIPULATIONS WHICH WERE DRAWN UP WITH A VIEW TO THOSE VERY INCIDENTS IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST FOURTEEN NINETY NINE
4839-15304-0009 OF WHOM FIVE THOUSAND WERE SWISS INVADED MILANESS DUKE LUDOVIC SFORZA OPPOSED TO IT A FORCE PRETTY NEARLY EQUAL IN NUMBER BUT FAR LESS FULL OF CONFIDENCE AND OF FAR LESS VALOR IN LESS THAN THREE WEEKS THE DUCHY WAS CONQUERED IN ONLY TWO CASES WAS ANY ASSAULT NECESSARY
4839-15304-0010 ALL THE OTHER PLACES WERE GIVEN UP BY TRAITORS OR SURRENDERED WITHOUT A SHOW OF RESISTANCE THE VENETIANS HAD THE SAME SUCCESS ON THE EASTERN FRONTIER OF THE DUCHY MILAN AND CREMONA ALONE REMAINED TO BE OCCUPIED LUDOVIC SFORZA
4839-15304-0011 APPEARED BEFORE HIS TROOPS AND HIS PEOPLE LIKE THE VERY SPIRIT OF LETHARGY SAYS A CONTEMPORARY UNPUBLISHED CHRONICLE WITH HIS HEAD BENT DOWN TO THE EARTH AND FOR A LONG WHILE HE REMAINED THUS PENSIVE AND WITHOUT A SINGLE WORD TO SAY
4839-15304-0012 HOWBEIT HE WAS NOT SO DISCOMFITED BUT THAT ON THAT VERY SAME DAY HE COULD GET HIS LUGGAGE PACKED HIS TRANSPORT TRAIN UNDER ORDERS HIS HORSES SHOD HIS DUCATS WITH WHICH HE HAD MORE THAN THIRTY MULES LADEN PUT BY
4839-15304-0013 AND IN SHORT EVERYTHING IN READINESS TO DECAMP NEXT MORNING AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE JUST AS HE LEFT MILAN HE SAID TO THE VENETIAN AMBASSADORS YOU HAVE BROUGHT THE KING OF FRANCE TO DINNER WITH ME
4839-15304-0014 AND YET THEY MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED THIS ALLIANCE WHICH ENTAILED THEIR RUIN FOR ALL HIS GREAT AND PROFOUND INTELLECT MACHIAVELLI WAS WRONG ABOUT THIS EVENT AND THE ACTORS IN IT THE VENETIANS DID NOT DESERVE HIS CENSURE
4839-15304-0015 INSTITUTED AT MILAN A COURT OF JUSTICE ANALOGOUS TO THE FRENCH PARLIAMENTS LOADED WITH FAVORS THE SCHOLARS AND ARTISTS WHO WERE THE HONOR OF LOMBARDY AND RECROSSED THE ALPS AT THE END OF SOME WEEKS
4839-15304-0016 ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OF JANUARY FIFTEEN HUNDRED THE INSURRECTION BROKE OUT AND TWO MONTHS LATER LUDOVIC SFORZA HAD ONCE MORE BECOME MASTER OF MILANESS WHERE THE FRENCH POSSESSED NOTHING BUT THE CASTLE OF MILAN
4839-15304-0017 IN ONE OF THE FIGHTS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THIS SUDDEN REVOLUTION THE YOUNG CHEVALIER BAYARD CARRIED AWAY BY THE IMPETUOSITY OF HIS AGE AND COURAGE PURSUED RIGHT INTO MILAN THE FOES HE WAS DRIVING BEFORE HIM WITHOUT NOTICING
4839-15304-0018 LUDOVIC ASKED WHAT IT MEANT AND WAS INFORMED THAT A BRAVE AND BOLD GENTLEMAN YOUNGER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS HAD ENTERED MILAN PELL MELL WITH THE COMBATANTS HE WAS PURSUING AND HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER BY JOHN BERNARDINO CASACCIO ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE INSURRECTION
4839-15304-0019 HE RESOLVED HIMSELF TO BE HIS CONDUCTOR AFTER HAVING DRESSED HIM IN ONE OF HIS OWN ROBES AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A GENTLEMAN MARVELLING TO SEE BAYARD SO YOUNG COME HITHER MY GENTLEMAN SAID LUDOVICO WHO BROUGHT YOU INTO THE CITY
4839-15304-0020 I NEVER IMAGINED I WAS ENTERING ALL ALONE AND THOUGHT SURELY I WAS BEING FOLLOWED OF MY COMRADES WHO KNEW MORE ABOUT WAR THAN I FOR IF THEY HAD DONE AS I DID THEY WOULD LIKE ME BE PRISONERS
4839-15304-0021 THAT YOU WOULD SURELY BE IN AS GREAT SAFETY IN GERMANY AS YOU ARE HERE FOR YOUR FOLKS ARE NOT THE SORT TO FIGHT US WITH SUCH ASSURANCE SPOKE THE GOOD KNIGHT THAT LORD LUDOVICO TOOK PLEASURE THERE IN THOUGH HIS SAY WAS ENOUGH TO ASTOUND HIM ON MY FAITH MY GENTLEMAN SAID HE AS IT WERE IN RAILLERY
4839-15304-0022 I HAVE A GOOD MIND THAT THE KING OF FRANCE'S ARMY AND MINE SHOULD COME TOGETHER IN ORDER THAT BY BATTLE IT MAY BE KNOWN TO WHOM OF RIGHT BELONGS THIS HERITAGE FOR I SEE NO OTHER WAY TO IT BY MY SACRED OATH MY LORD SAID THE GOOD KNIGHT I WOULD THAT IT MIGHT BE TO MORROW PROVIDED THAT I WERE OUT OF CAPTIVITY
4839-15304-0023 AND BARRING MY DUTY TO THE KING MY MASTER AND SAVING MY HONOR I WOULD SHOW MY GRATITUDE FOR IT IN WHATSOEVER IT MIGHT PLEASE YOU TO COMMAND ME IN GOOD FAITH SAID LORD LUDOVICO YOU SHALL HAVE PRESENTLY THAT WHICH YOU DO ASK FOR
4839-15304-0024 AND LORD LUDOVICO HAD HIM ARMED BEFORE HIS EYES WHEN HE WAS ACCOUTRED THE YOUNG KNIGHT LEAPED UPON HIS HORSE WITHOUT PUTTING FOOT TO STIRRUP
4839-15304-0025 AND RAISING HIS EYES HE SAID TO LORD LUDOVICO MY LORD I THANK YOU FOR THE COURTESY YOU HAVE DONE ME PLEASE GOD TO PAY IT BACK TO YOU HE WAS IN A FINE LARGE COURT YARD THEN HE BEGAN TO SET SPURS TO HIS HORSE THE WHICH GAVE FOUR OR FIVE JUMPS SO GAYLY THAT IT COULD NOT BE BETTER DONE

4839-15304-0030 AT THE ENTRANCE INTO THE CITY A GREAT NUMBER OF GENTLEMEN FROM THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD WERE PRESENT TO MEET HIM
4839-15304-0031 WHERE HE WAS LODGED AND PLACED IN SECURITY THERE HE PASSED A FORTNIGHT LOUIS REFUSED TO SEE HIM BUT HAD HIM QUESTIONED AS TO SEVERAL MATTERS BY THE LORDS OF HIS GRAND COUNCIL AND GRANTED THAT HE HAD COMMITTED NOUGHT BUT FOLLIES STILL HE SPOKE RIGHT WISELY

4839-15305-0002 TERRA DI LAVORO AND THE PROVINCE OF THE ABRUZZI
4839-15305-0003 HE DID NOT HERE AS HE HAD DONE FOR THE CONQUEST OF MILANESS JOIN HIMSELF TO AN ALLY OF FAR INFERIOR POWER TO HIS OWN AND OF AMBITION CONFINED WITHIN FAR NARROWER BOUNDARIES
4839-15305-0004 MEDIOCRE MEN WHO DESIRE TO REMAIN PRETTY NEARLY HONEST HAVE ALWAYS THE WORST OF IT AND ARE ALWAYS DUPES WHEN THEY ALLY THEMSELVES WITH MEN WHO ARE CORRUPT AND AT THE SAME TIME ABLE INDIFFERENT TO GOOD AND EVIL TO JUSTICE AND INIQUITY
4839-15305-0005 HIDDEN OPPOSITION IN THE VERY MIDST OF JOINT ACTION AND AFTERWARDS OPEN TREASON AND DEFECTION HE FORGOT MOREOVER THAT FERDINAND HAD AT THE HEAD OF HIS ARMIES A TRIED CHIEFTAIN GONZALVO OF CORDOVA ALREADY KNOWN THROUGHOUT EUROPE AS THE GREAT CAPTAIN
4839-15305-0006 WHO HAD WON THAT NAME IN CAMPAIGNS AGAINST THE MOORS THE TURKS AND THE PORTUGUESE AND WHO HAD THE CHARACTER OF BEING AS FREE FROM SCRUPLE AS FROM FEAR LASTLY THE SUPPORTERS WHO AT THE VERY COMMENCEMENT OF HIS ENTERPRISES IN ITALY
4839-15305-0007 WERE AS LITTLE TO BE DEPENDED UPON IN THE FUTURE AS THEY WERE COMPROMISING AT THE PRESENT BY REASON OF THEIR REPUTATION FOR UNBRIDLED AMBITION PERFIDY AND CRIME THE KING OF FRANCE WHATEVER SACRIFICES HE MIGHT ALREADY HAVE MADE AND MIGHT STILL MAKE IN ORDER TO INSURE THEIR CO OPERATION COULD NO MORE COUNT UPON IT
4839-15305-0008 FORTIFIED WITH THIS AUTHORITY THE ARMY CONTINUED ITS MARCH AND ARRIVED BEFORE CAPUA ON THE SIXTH OF JULY GONZALVO OF CORDOVA WAS ALREADY UPON NEAPOLITAN TERRITORY WITH A SPANISH ARMY WHICH FERDINAND THE CATHOLIC HAD HASTILY SENT THITHER
4839-15305-0009 AT THE REQUEST OF FREDERICK THREE HIMSELF WHO HAD COUNTED UPON THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS COUSIN THE KING OF ARRAGON AGAINST THE FRENCH INVASION GREAT WAS HIS CONSTERNATION WHEN HE HEARD THAT THE AMBASSADORS OF FRANCE AND SPAIN HAD PROCLAIMED AT ROME THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN THEIR MASTERS
4839-15305-0010 AT THE FIRST RUMOR OF THIS NEWS GONZALVO OF CORDOVA WHETHER SINCERELY OR NOT
4839-15305-0011 BUT SO SOON AS ITS CERTAINTY WAS MADE PUBLIC HE ACCEPTED IT WITHOUT HESITATION AND TOOK EQUALLY WITH THE FRENCH THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE KING ALREADY DETHRONED BY THE POPE AND VERY NEAR BEING SO BY THE TWO SOVEREIGNS WHO HAD MADE ALLIANCE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHARING BETWEEN THEM
4839-15305-0012 THE SPOIL THEY SHOULD GET FROM HIM CAPUA CAPITULATED AND WAS NEVERTHELESS PLUNDERED AND LAID WASTE A FRENCH FLEET COMMANDED BY PHILIP DE RAVENSTEIN ARRIVED OFF NAPLES WHEN D'AUBIGNY WAS ALREADY MASTER OF IT
4839-15305-0013 HE WOULD WILLINGLY ADVISE HIM AS TO HIS AFFAIRS ACCORDING TO HIS ADVICE THE BEST THING WOULD BE TO SURRENDER AND PLACE HIMSELF IN THE HANDS OF THE KING OF FRANCE AND SUBMIT TO HIS GOOD PLEASURE HE WOULD FIND HIM SO WISE AND SO DEBONNAIR AND SO ACCOMMODATING THAT HE WOULD BE BOUND TO BE CONTENT
4839-15305-0014 BETTER OR SAFER COUNSEL FOR HIM HE HAD NOT TO GIVE AFTER TAKING SOME PRECAUTIONS ON THE SCORE OF HIS ELDEST SON PRINCE FERDINAND WHOM HE LEFT AT TARENTO IN THE KINGDOM HE WAS ABOUT TO QUIT
4839-15305-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTERWARDS AND NOT BEFORE HE WAS CONDUCTED TO THE KING HIMSELF WHO WAS THEN AT BLOIS LOUIS WELCOMED HIM WITH HIS NATURAL KINDNESS AND SECURED TO HIM FIFTY THOUSAND LIVRES A YEAR ON THE DUCHY OF ANJOU
4839-15305-0016 IN GIVING THE SENATE AN ACCOUNT OF HIS MISSION ONE OF THE AMBASSADORS DOMINIC OF TREVISO
4839-15305-0017 AND TEMPERATE IN EATING TAKING SCARCELY ANYTHING BUT BOILED BEEF HE IS BY NATURE MISERLY AND RETENTIVE HIS GREAT PLEASURE IS HAWKING FROM SEPTEMBER TO APRIL HE HAWKS
4839-15305-0018 NOTHING HOWEVER WITH OUT THE COGNIZANCE OF THE KING WHO HAS A FAR FROM STABLE MIND SAYING YES AND NO I AM OF OPINION THAT THEIR LORDSHIPS SHOULD REMOVE EVERY SUSPICION FROM HIS MAJESTY'S MIND AND AIM AT KEEPING THEMSELVES CLOSELY UNITED WITH HIM
4839-15305-0020 THE KING HAD MORE THAN ONCE FELT AND TESTIFIED SOME DISPLEASURE
4839-15305-0021 BY THE POPE'S NEPHEW CAESAR BORGIA TO WHOM HE HAD GIVEN THE TITLE OF DUKE OF VALENTINOIS
4839-15305-0022 LOUIS ON HIS SIDE SHOWED ANXIETY AS TO THE CONDUCT WHICH WOULD BE EXHIBITED TOWARDS HIM BY THE VENETIANS IF HE ENCOUNTERED ANY EMBARRASSMENT IN HIS EXPEDITION TO NAPLES
4839-15305-0023 THE FRENCH AND THE SPANIARDS D'AUBIGNY AND GONZALVO OF CORDOVA AT FIRST GAVE THEIR ATTENTION TO NOTHING BUT ESTABLISHING THEMSELVES FIRMLY EACH IN THE INTERESTS OF THE KING HIS MASTER IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE KINGDOM WHICH WERE TO BELONG TO THEM BUT BEFORE LONG
4839-15305-0024 DISPUTES AROSE BETWEEN THE TWO GENERALS AS TO THE MEANING OF CERTAIN CLAUSES IN THE TREATY OF NOVEMBER ELEVENTH FIFTEEN HUNDRED
4839-15305-0025 LOUIS D'ARMAGNAC DUKE OF NEMOURS A BRAVE WARRIOR BUT A NEGOTIATOR INCLINED TO TAKE UMBRAGE AND TO GIVE OFFENCE THE DISPUTES SOON TOOK THE FORM OF HOSTILITIES THE FRENCH ESSAYED TO DRIVE THE SPANIARDS FROM THE POINTS THEY HAD OCCUPIED IN THE DISPUTED TERRITORIES
4839-15305-0026 AND AT FIRST THEY HAD THE ADVANTAGE GONZALVO OF CORDOVA FROM NECESSITY OR IN PRUDENCE CONCENTRATED HIS FORCES WITHIN BARLETTA A LITTLE FORTRESS WITH A LITTLE PORT ON THE ADRIATIC
4839-15305-0027 BETWEEN THE KINGS OF SPAIN AND FRANCE MADE A CHANGE IN THE POSITION RECIPROCALLY OF THE TWO SOVEREIGNS AND MUST SUSPEND THE MILITARY OPERATIONS OF THEIR GENERALS WITHIN THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES THE FRENCH GENERAL DECLARED HIS READINESS TO OBEY HIS KING SAYS GUICCIARDINI
4839-15305-0028 BUT THE SPANISH WHETHER IT WERE THAT HE FELT SURE OF VICTORY OR THAT HE HAD RECEIVED PRIVATE INSTRUCTIONS ON THAT POINT SAID THAT HE COULD NOT STOP THE WAR WITHOUT EXPRESS ORDERS FROM HIS KING AND SALLYING FORTHWITH FROM BARLETTA HE GAINED ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF APRIL FIFTEEN O THREE AT CERIGNOLA
4839-15305-0029 HAD ALSO BEATEN ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF APRIL AT SEMINARA A FRENCH CORPS COMMANDED BY D'AUBIGNY THE GREAT CAPTAIN WAS AS EAGER TO PROFIT BY VICTORY AS HE HAD BEEN PATIENT IN WAITING FOR A CHANCE OF IT HE MARCHED RAPIDLY ON NAPLES AND ENTERED IT ON THE FOURTEENTH OF MAY
4839-15305-0030 CAPUA AND AVERSA FOLLOWED ITS EXAMPLE GAETA WAS THE ONLY IMPORTANT PLACE WHICH STILL HELD OUT FOR THE FRENCH AND CONTAINED A GARRISON CAPABLE OF DEFENDING IT AND THITHER THE REMNANT OF THE TROOPS BEATEN AT SEMINARA AND AT CERIGNOLA
4839-15305-0031 THE COMMAND DEVOLVED UPON THE MARQUIS OF MANTUA WHO MARCHED ON GAETA
4839-15305-0032 EITHER TO INVEST THE PLACE OR TO REPULSE RE ENFORCEMENTS THAT MIGHT ARRIVE FOR IT
4839-15305-0033 THE FRENCH ARMY WAS DISPERSING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF SHELTER AND PROVISIONS
4839-15305-0034 GONZALVO WHO WAS KEPT WELL INFORMED OF HIS ENEMIES CONDITION THREW ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF DECEMBER A BRIDGE OVER THE GARIGLIANO
4839-15305-0035 WHICH THEY DID NOT SUCCEED IN ENTERING UNTIL THEY HAD LOST ARTILLERY BAGGAGE AND A NUMBER OF PRISONERS THE SPANIARDS SAYS JOHN D'AUTON HALTED BEFORE THE PLACE MADE AS IF THEY WOULD LAY SIEGE TO IT AND SO REMAINED FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS THE FRENCH WHO WERE THERE IN GREAT NUMBERS
4839-15305-0036 HAD SCARCELY ANY PROVISIONS AND COULD NOT HOLD OUT FOR LONG HOWEVER THEY PUT A GOOD FACE UPON IT THE CAPTAIN GONZALVO SENT WORD TO THEM THAT IF THEY WOULD SURRENDER THEIR TOWN HE WOULD ON HIS PART RESTORE TO THEM WITHOUT RANSOM ALL PRISONERS AND OTHERS OF THEIR PARTY
4839-15305-0037 WOULD SUCCEED HIM AND THAT HOPE HAD A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH THE SHOCKING FAVOR HE SHOWED CAESAR BORGIA THAT INFAMOUS SON OF A DEMORALIZED FATHER
4839-15305-0038 A FOUR WEEKS POPE PIUS THE THIRD
4839-15305-0039 AND WHEN THE HOLY SEE SUDDENLY BECAME ONCE MORE VACANT
4839-15305-0040 LOUIS CONCLUDED ON THE THIRTY FIRST OF MARCH FIFTEEN O FOUR A TRUCE FOR THREE YEARS WITH THE KING OF SPAIN
4839-15305-0041 IN ORDER TO SATISFY HIS GRUDGE ON ACCOUNT OF THE VENETIANS DEMEANOR TOWARDS HIM
4839-15305-0042 WITH THE DESIGN ALL THREE OF THEM OF WRESTING CERTAIN PROVINCES FROM THEM WITH THOSE POLITICAL MISCALCULATIONS WAS CONNECTED A MORE PERSONAL AND MORE DISINTERESTED FEELING
4839-15305-0043 TO PRINCE CHARLES OF AUSTRIA AND OF THE ENORMOUS CONCESSIONS HE HAD MADE BY TWO TREATIES ONE OF APRIL FIFTH FIFTEEN O THREE AND THE OTHER OF SEPTEMBER TWENTY SECOND FIFTEEN O FOUR FOR THE SAKE OF THIS MARRIAGE HE HAD ASSIGNED AS DOWRY TO HIS DAUGHTER FIRST THE DUCHY OF MILAN
4839-15307-0000 THE KING SAYS GUICCIARDINI DEPARTED FROM ITALY CARRYING AWAY WITH HIM TO FRANCE GREAT GLORY BY REASON OF SO COMPLETE AND SO RAPIDLY WON A VICTORY OVER THE VENETIANS NEVERTHELESS AS IN THE CASE OF THINGS OBTAINED AFTER HOPE LONG DEFERRED
4839-15307-0001 MEN SCARCELY EVER FEEL SUCH JOY AND HAPPINESS AS THEY HAD AT FIRST IMAGINED THEY WOULD THE KING TOOK NOT BACK WITH HIM EITHER GREATER PEACE OF MIND OR GREATER SECURITY IN RESPECT OF HIS AFFAIRS THE BEATEN VENETIANS ACCEPTED THEIR DEFEAT WITH SUCH A MIXTURE OF HUMILITY
4839-15307-0002 AND DIGNITY AS SOON CHANGED THEIR POSITION IN ITALY THEY BEGAN BY PROVIDING ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE DEFENCE OF VENICE HERSELF FOREIGNERS BUT ONLY IDLE FOREIGNERS WERE EXPELLED THOSE WHO HAD ANY BUSINESS WHICH SECURED THEM MEANS OF EXISTENCE
4839-15307-0003 AND ORDERED ITS COMMANDANTS TO EVACUATE SUCH PLACES AS THEY STILL HELD NEARLY ALL SUCH SUBMITTED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE TO THE VICTOR OF AGNADELLO AND HIS ALLIES OF CAMBRAI BUT AT TREVISO WHEN EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN'S COMMISSIONER PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER TO TAKE POSSESSION OF IT
4839-15307-0004 THEY HEARD THAT THE IMPORTANT TOWN OF PADUA WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE SHARE OF EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN WAS UTTERING PASSIONATE MURMURS AGAINST ITS NEW MASTER AND WISHED FOR NOTHING BETTER THAN TO COME BACK BENEATH THE OLD SWAY AND IN SPITE OF THE OPPOSITION SHOWN BY THE DOGE LOREDANO
4839-15307-0005 THE VENETIANS RESOLVED TO ATTEMPT THE VENTURE DURING THE NIGHT BETWEEN THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH OF JULY A SMALL DETACHMENT WELL ARMED AND WELL LED ARRIVED BENEATH THE WALLS OF PADUA WHICH WAS RATHER CARELESSLY GUARDED IN THE MORNING AS SOON AS THE GATE WAS OPENED
4839-15307-0006 A STRING OF LARGE WAGONS PRESENTED THEMSELVES FOR ADMITTANCE BEHIND ONE OF THESE AND PARTIALLY CONCEALED BY ITS BULK ADVANCED SIX VENETIAN MEN AT ARMS EACH CARRYING ON HIS CRUPPER A FOOT SOLDIER ARMED WITH AN ARQUEBUSE THEY FIRED ON THE GUARD EACH KILLED HIS MAN
4839-15307-0007 THE AUSTRIAN GARRISON HURRIED UP AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT OTHER VENETIAN TROOPS ARRIVED AND THE GARRISON WAS BEATEN AND SURRENDERED PADUA BECAME VENETIAN AGAIN
4839-15307-0008 CAUSED INEXPRESSIBLE JOY IN VENICE AFTER SO MANY DISASTERS THERE WAS SEEN A GLEANS OF HOPE THE VENETIANS HASTENED TO PROVISION PADUA WELL AND TO PUT IT IN A STATE OF DEFENCE
4839-15307-0009 A BODY OF TROOPS UNDER THE ORDERS OF JAMES DE CHABANNES
4839-15307-0010 AND PROVISIONED IT WELL AND IT WAS ONLY ON THE FIFTEENTH OF SEPTEMBER THAT HE SAT DOWN BEFORE THE PLACE ALL THE ALLIES OF THE LEAGUE OF CAMBRAI HELD THEMSELVES BOUND TO FURNISH HIM WITH THEIR CONTINGENT ON SALLYING FROM MILAN FOR THIS CAMPAIGN
4839-15307-0011 LA PALISSE FELL IN WITH THE GOOD KNIGHT BAYARD TO WHOM HE SAID MY COMRADE MY FRIEND WOULD YOU NOT LIKE US TO BE COMRADES TOGETHER BAYARD WHO ASKED NOTHING BETTER ANSWERED HIM GRACIOUSLY THAT HE WAS AT HIS SERVICE TO BE DISPOSED OF AT HIS PLEASURE
4839-15307-0012 AND FROM THE FIFTEENTH TO THE TWENTIETH OF SEPTEMBER MAXIMILIAN GOT TOGETHER BEFORE PADUA AN ARMY WITH A STRENGTH IT IS SAID OF ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND MEN MEN AT ARMS OR INFANTRY
4839-15307-0013 SENT BY THE POPE AND BY THE DUKE OF FERRARA OR RECRUITED FROM ALL PARTS OF ITALY AT THE FIRST RUMOR OF SUCH A FORCE THERE WAS GREAT EMOTION IN VENICE BUT AN EMOTION TEMPERED BY BRAVERY AND INTELLIGENCE THE DOGE LEONARDO LOREDANO
4839-15307-0014 THE SAME WHO HAD BUT LATELY OPPOSED THE SURPRISAL OF PADUA ROSE UP AND DELIVERED IN THE SENATE A LONG SPEECH OF WHICH ONLY THE ESSENTIAL AND CHARACTERISTIC POINTS CAN BE QUOTED HERE EVERYBODY KNOWS EXCELLENT GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE SAID HE
4839-15307-0015 ARE NOT SUFFICIENT EITHER FOR THE SECURITY OF THAT TOWN OR FOR THE DIGNITY OF OUR REPUBLIC OUR ANCIENT RENOWN FORBIDS US TO LEAVE THE PUBLIC SAFETY
4839-15307-0016 TO SAVE IT WHO WOULD REFUSE TO RISK HIS OWN LIFE AND THAT OF HIS CHILDREN IF THE DEFENCE OF PADUA IS THE PLEDGE FOR THE SALVATION OF VENICE WHO WOULD HESITATE TO GO AND DEFEND IT AND THOUGH THE FORCES ALREADY THERE WERE SUFFICIENT IS NOT OUR HONOR ALSO CONCERNED THEREIN
4839-15307-0017 THE FORTUNE OF OUR CITY SO WILLED IT THAT IN THE SPACE OF A FEW DAYS OUR EMPIRE SLIPPED FROM OUR HANDS THE OPPORTUNITY HAS COME BACK TO US OF RECOVERING WHAT WE HAVE LOST BY SPONTANEOUSLY FACING THE CHANGES AND CHANCES OF FATE WE SHALL PROVE THAT OUR DISASTERS
4839-15307-0018 HAVE NOT BEEN OUR FAULT OR OUR SHAME BUT ONE OF THOSE FATAL STORMS WHICH NO WISDOM AND NO FIRMNESS OF MAN CAN RESIST IF IT WERE PERMITTED US ALL IN ONE MASS TO SET OUT FOR PADUA IF WE MIGHT WITHOUT NEGLECTING THE DEFENCE OF OUR OWN HOMES AND OUR URGENT PUBLIC AFFAIRS
4839-15307-0019 BUT VENICE MAY NOT BE DESERTED BY HER PUBLIC BODIES WHICH PROTECT AND DEFEND PADUA BY THEIR FORETHOUGHT AND THEIR ORDERS JUST AS OTHERS DO BY THEIR ARMS AND A USELESS MOB OF GRAYBEARDS WOULD BE A BURDEN MUCH MORE THAN A REENFORCEMENT THERE
4839-15307-0020 AND WHEN THE MERCENARY SOLDIERS WHO ARE THERE SEE HOW PROMPT ARE OUR YOUTH TO GUARD THE GATES AND EVERYWHERE FACE THE BATTLE THEY WILL BE MOVED THEREBY TO ZEAL AND ALACRITY INCALCULABLE AND NOT ONLY WILL PADUA THUS BE DEFENDED AND SAVED
4839-15307-0021 OF THE NOBLEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THIS GENEROUS ADVICE WAS ACCEPTED BY THE FATHERS AND CARRIED OUT BY THE SONS WITH THAT EARNEST PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE ARDOR WHICH ACCOMPANIES THE RESOLUTION OF GREAT SOULS
4839-15307-0022 WHEN THE PADUANS BEFORE THEIR CITY WAS AS YET INVESTED SAW THE ARRIVAL WITHIN THEIR WALLS OF THESE CHOSEN YOUTHS OF THE VENETIAN PATRICIATE WITH THEIR NUMEROUS TROOP OF FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS THEY CONSIDERED PADUA AS GOOD AS SAVED
4839-15307-0023 AND WHEN THE IMPERIAL ARMY POSTED BEFORE THE PLACE COMMENCED THEIR ATTACKS UPON IT THEY SOON PERCEIVED THAT THEY HAD FORMIDABLE DEFENDERS TO DEAL WITH FIVE HUNDRED YEARS IT WAS SINCE IN PRINCE'S CAMP HAD EVER BEEN SEEN SUCH WEALTH AS THERE WAS THERE
4839-15307-0024 AND NEVER WAS A DAY BUT THERE FILED OFF SOME THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED LANZKNECHTS WHO TOOK AWAY TO GERMANY OXEN AND KINE BEDS CORN SILK FOR SEWING AND OTHER ARTICLES IN SUCH SORT THAT TO THE SAID COUNTRY OF PADUA WAS DAMAGE DONE TO THE AMOUNT OF TWO MILLIONS OF CROWNS IN MOVABLES
4839-15307-0025 WENT THITHER TO LOOK AND HE MARVELLED AND THOUGHT IT GREAT SHAME TO HIM WITH THE NUMBER OF MEN HE HAD THAT HE HAD NOT SOONER DELIVERED THE ASSAULT ON RETURNING TO HIS QUARTERS HE SENT FOR A FRENCH SECRETARY OF HIS WHOM HE BADE WRITE TO THE LORD OF LA PALISSE A LETTER
4839-15307-0026 WHEREOF THIS WAS THE SUBSTANCE DEAR COUSIN I HAVE THIS MORNING BEEN TO LOOK AT THE BREACH WHICH I FIND MORE THAN PRACTICABLE FOR WHOEVER WOULD DO HIS DUTY I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO DELIVER THE ASSAULT TO DAY I PRAY YOU SO SOON AS MY BIG DRUM SOUNDS
4839-15307-0027 WHICH WILL BE ABOUT MIDDAY THAT YOU DO INCONTINENTLY HOLD READY ALL THE FRENCH GENTLEMEN WHO ARE UNDER YOUR ORDERS AT MY SERVICE BY COMMAND OF MY BROTHER THE KING OF FRANCE TO GO TO THE SAID ASSAULT ALONG WITH MY FOOT AND I HOPE THAT WITH GOD'S HELP WE SHALL CARRY IT
4839-15307-0028 I DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE MANY WHO WILL NOT BE OBEDIENT TO THAT WHICH THE EMPEROR SHALL BE PLEASED TO COMMAND
4839-15307-0029 EVERYBODY WAS SENT OUT OF THE ROOM SAVE THE CAPTAINS TO WHOM THE LORD OF LA PALISSE MADE KNOWN THE EMPEROR'S LETTER WHICH WAS READ TWICE FOR THE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF IT THEY ALL LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER LAUGHING FOR TO SEE WHO WOULD SPEAK FIRST THEN SAID THE LORD OF YMBERCOURT TO THE LORD OF LA PALISSE
4839-15307-0030 IT NEEDS NOT SO MUCH THOUGHT MY LORD SEND WORD TO THE EMPEROR THAT WE ARE ALL READY I AM EVEN NOW A WEARY OF THE FIELDS FOR THE NIGHTS ARE COLD AND THEN THE GOOD WINES ARE BEGINNING TO FAIL US WHEREAT EVERY ONE BURST OUT A LAUGHING ALL AGREED TO WHAT WAS SAID BY THE LORD OF YMBERCOURT
4839-15307-0031 GAYLY THE GOOD KNIGHT ANSWERED IF WE WOULD ALL TAKE MY LORD OF YMBERCOURT'S WORD WE HAVE ONLY TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE BREACH BUT IT IS A SOMEWHAT SORRY PASTIME FOR MEN AT ARMS TO GO AFOOT AND I WOULD GLADLY BE EXCUSED HOWBEIT SINCE I MUST GIVE MY OPINION I WILL
4839-15307-0032 FOR TO DELIVER THE ASSAULT ALONG WITH HIS
4839-15307-0033 MY OPINION IS THAT YOU MY LORD OUGHT TO SEND BACK TO THE EMPEROR A REPLY OF THIS SORT THAT YOU HAVE HAD A MEETING OF YOUR CAPTAINS WHO ARE QUITE DETERMINED TO DO HIS BIDDING ACCORDING TO THE CHARGE THEY HAVE FROM THE KING THEIR MASTER
4839-15307-0034 WOULD BE TO MAKE THEM OF LITTLE ACCOUNT THE EMPEROR HAS LOADS OF COUNTS LORDS AND GENTLEMEN OF GERMANY LET HIM SET THEM AFOOT ALONG WITH THE MEN AT ARMS OF FRANCE WHO WILL GLADLY SHOW THEM THE ROAD AND THEN HIS LANZKNECHTS WILL FOLLOW IF THEY KNOW THAT IT WILL PAY
4839-15307-0035 THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO GO WITHIN AN HOUR AND DELIVER THE ASSAULT ON THE TOWN WHEREOF HE HAD NOTIFIED THE LORDS OF FRANCE WHO WERE ALL MOST DESIROUS OF DOING THEIR DUTY THEREIN RIGHT WELL AND PRAYED HIM THAT ALONG WITH THEM MIGHT GO THE GENTLEMEN OF GERMANY TO WHOM THEY WOULD GLADLY SHOW THE ROAD
4839-15307-0036 WHEREFORE MY LORDS SAID THE EMPEROR I PRAY YOU AS MUCH AS EVER I CAN TO BE PLEASED TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND SET YOURSELVES AFOOT WITH THEM AND I HOPE WITH GOD'S HELP THAT AT THE FIRST ASSAULT WE SHALL BE MASTERS OF OUR ENEMIES WHEN THE EMPEROR HAD DONE SPEAKING
4839-15307-0037 ON A SUDDEN THERE AROSE AMONG HIS GERMANS A VERY WONDROUS AND STRANGE UPROAR WHICH LASTED HALF AN HOUR BEFORE IT WAS APPEASED AND THEN ONE AMONGST THEM BIDDEN TO ANSWER FOR ALL SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT FOLKS TO BE SET AFOOT
4839-15307-0038 OTHER ANSWER THE EMPEROR COULD NOT GET
4839-15307-0039 AND PLEASED HIM NOT AT ALL HE UTTERED NO WORD BEYOND THAT HE SAID GOOD MY LORDS WE MUST ADVISE THEN HOW WE SHALL DO FOR THE BEST THEN FORTHWITH HE SENT FOR A GENTLEMAN OF HIS WHO FROM TIME TO TIME WENT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AS AMBASSADOR TO THE FRENCH AND SAID TO HIM
4839-15307-0040 COMMEND ME TO HIM AND TO ALL MY LORDS THE FRENCH CAPTAINS YOU FIND WITH HIM AND TELL THEM THAT FOR TO DAY THE ASSAULT WILL NOT BE DELIVERED I KNOW NOT SAYS THE CHRONICLER HOW IT WAS NOR WHO GAVE THE ADVICE BUT THE NIGHT AFTER THIS SPEECH WAS SPOKEN THE EMPEROR WENT OFF
4839-15307-0041 BUT HE WAS COARSE VOLATILE INCONSISTENT AND NOT VERY ABLE
4839-15307-0042 A MORE SERIOUS AND MORE SKILFUL FOE WHO WAS PREPARING FOR HIM MUCH GREATER EMBARRASSMENTS JULIAN BELLA ROVERA HAD BEFORE HIS ELEVATION TO THE PONTIFICAL THRONE BUT ONE OBJECT WHICH WAS TO MOUNT IT
4839-15307-0043 WHEN HE BECAME POPE HE HAD THREE OBJECTS TO RECOVER AND EXTEND THE TEMPORAL POSSESSIONS OF THE PAPACY TO EXERCISE TO THE FULL HIS SPIRITUAL POWER AND TO DRIVE THE FOREIGNER FROM ITALY HE WAS NOT INCAPABLE OF DOUBLING AND ARTIFICE
4839-15307-0044 WITH THE HOPE THAT THE KING'S MINISTER WOULD BECOME THE HEAD OF CHRISTENDOM WHEN ONCE HE WAS HIMSELF IN POSSESSION OF THIS PUISSANT TITLE HE SHOWED HIMSELF AS HE REALLY WAS AMBITIOUS AUDACIOUS IMPERIOUS ENERGETIC STUBBORN AND COMBINING THE EGOTISM OF THE ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGN
4839-15307-0045 WITH THE PATRIOTISM OF AN ITALIAN POPE WHEN THE LEAGUE OF CAMBRAI HAD ATTAINED SUCCESS
4839-15307-0046 LET THEM HAVE AN INKLING THAT HE WAS NOT WITHOUT SUSPICION OF SOME NEW DESIGN
4839-15307-0047 HE HAS DONE EVERYTHING AT THE MOMENT HE PROMISED HE HAS BORNE UPON HIS SHOULDERS THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THIS AFFAIR AND I TELL YOU HE ADDED WITH A FIXED LOOK AT THOSE WHOM HE WAS ADDRESSING THAT HIS ARMY IS A LARGE ONE WHICH HE WILL KEEP UP AND AUGMENT EVERY DAY
4839-15307-0048 LOUIS FOR HIS PART TREATED THE FLORENTINES WITH GREAT GOOD WILL AS FRIENDS ON WHOM HE COUNTED AND WHO WERE CONCERNED IN HIS SUCCESS YOU HAVE BECOME THE FIRST POWER IN ITALY HE SAID TO THEN ONE DAY BEFORE A CROWD OF PEOPLE HOW ARE YOU ADDRESSED JUST NOW
4839-15307-0049 ARE YOU MOST SERENE OR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND WHEN HE WAS NOTIFIED THAT DISTINGUISHED VENETIANS WERE GOING TO MEET EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN ON HIS ARRIVAL IN ITALY NO MATTER SAID LOUIS LET THEM GO WHITHER THEY WILL
5154-26558-0000 PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW IT BUT THE MONKEYS THINK THAT ALL THE BANANAS BELONG TO THEM WHEN BRAZILIAN CHILDREN EAT BANANAS THEY SAY I AM A MONKEY I ONCE KNEW A LITTLE BOY IN BRAZIL WHO WAS VERY VERY FOND OF BANANAS
5154-26558-0001 HE ALWAYS SAID I AM VERY MUCH OF A MONKEY IF YOU ARE FOND OF BANANAS THE BRAZILIAN CHILDREN WOULD TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE A MONKEY TOO THIS IS THE STORY THEY TELL TO SHOW US HOW IT ALL CAME ABOUT
5154-26558-0002 ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN THE WORLD HAD JUST BEEN MADE AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE KIND OF BANANA BUT VERY MANY KINDS OF MONKEYS THERE WAS A LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD A BIG GARDEN FULL OF BANANA TREES
5154-26558-0003 IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE OLD WOMAN TO GATHER THE BANANAS HERSELF SO SHE MADE A BARGAIN WITH THE LARGEST MONKEY SHE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE WOULD GATHER THE BUNCHES OF BANANAS FOR HER SHE WOULD GIVE HIM HALF OF THEM THE MONKEY GATHERED THE BANANAS
5154-26558-0004 WHEN HE TOOK HIS HALF HE GAVE THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN THE BANANAS WHICH GROW AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BUNCH AND ARE SMALL AND WRINKLED THE NICE BIG FAT ONES HE KEPT FOR HIMSELF AND CARRIED THEM HOME TO LET THEM RIPEN IN THE DARK
5154-26558-0005 THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WAS VERY ANGRY SHE LAY AWAKE ALL NIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF SOME WAY BY WHICH SHE COULD GET EVEN WITH THE MONKEY AT LAST SHE THOUGHT OF A TRICK
5154-26558-0006 THE NEXT MORNING SHE MADE AN IMAGE OF WAX WHICH LOOKED JUST LIKE A LITTLE BLACK BOY THEN SHE PLACED A LARGE FLAT BASKET ON THE TOP OF THE IMAGE'S HEAD AND IN THE BASKET
5154-26558-0007 AFTER A LITTLE WHILE THE BIGGEST MONKEY PASSED THAT WAY HE SAW THE IMAGE OF WAX AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A BOY PEDDLING BANANAS HE HAD OFTEN PUSHED OVER BOY BANANA PEDDLERS UPSET THEIR BASKETS AND THEN HAD RUN AWAY WITH THE BANANAS
5154-26558-0008 THIS MORNING HE WAS FEELING VERY GOOD NATURED
5154-26558-0009 THE IMAGE OF WAX ANSWERED NEVER A WORD AGAIN THE MONKEY SAID THIS TIME IN A LITTLE LOUDER VOICE O PEDDLER BOY PEDDLER BOY PLEASE GIVE ME A BANANA JUST ONE LITTLE RIPE LITTLE
5154-26558-0010 SWEET LITTLE BANANA THE IMAGE OF WAX ANSWERED NEVER A WORD THEN THE MONKEY CALLED OUT IN HIS LOUDEST VOICE O PEDDLER BOY PEDDLER BOY IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME A BANANA I'LL GIVE YOU SUCH A PUSH THAT IT WILL UPSET
5154-26558-0011 THE IMAGE OF WAX WAS SILENT THE MONKEY RAN TOWARD THE IMAGE OF WAX AND STRUCK IT HARD WITH HIS HAND HIS HAND REMAINED FIRMLY EMBEDDED IN THE WAX O PEDDLER BOY PEDDLER BOY LET GO MY HAND
5154-26558-0012 THE MONKEY CALLED OUT LET GO MY HAND AND GIVE ME A BANANA OR ELSE I'LL GIVE YOU A HARD HARD BLOW WITH MY OTHER HAND THE IMAGE OF WAX DID NOT LET GO THE MONKEY GAVE THE IMAGE A HARD HARD BLOW WITH HIS OTHER HAND
5154-26558-0013 THE OTHER HAND REMAINED FIRMLY EMBEDDED IN THE WAX THEN THE MONKEY CALLED OUT O PEDDLER BOY PEDDLER BOY LET GO MY TWO HANDS LET GO MY TWO HANDS AND GIVE ME A BANANA OR ELSE I WILL GIVE YOU A KICK WITH MY FOOT THE IMAGE OF WAX
5154-26558-0014 DID NOT LET GO THE MONKEY GAVE THE IMAGE A KICK WITH HIS FOOT AND HIS FOOT REMAINED STUCK FAST IN THE WAX
5154-26558-0015 LET GO MY FOOT LET GO MY TWO HANDS AND MY FOOT
5154-26558-0016 THE IMAGE OF WAX DID NOT LET GO THEN THE MONKEY
5154-26558-0017 DID NOT LET GO THEN THE MONKEY MADE SUCH AN UPROAR WITH HIS CRIES AND SHOUTS THAT VERY SOON MONKEYS CAME RUNNING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS THERE WERE BIG MONKEYS AND LITTLE MONKEYS AND MIDDLE SIZED MONKEYS
5154-26558-0018 A WHOLE ARMY OF MONKEYS HAD COME TO THE AID OF THE BIGGEST MONKEY IT WAS THE VERY LITTLEST MONKEY WHO THOUGHT OF A PLAN TO HELP THE BIGGEST MONKEY OUT OF HIS PLIGHT
5154-26558-0019 THE MONKEYS WERE TO CLIMB UP INTO THE BIGGEST TREE AND PILE THEMSELVES ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER UNTIL THEY MADE A PYRAMID OF MONKEYS THE MONKEY WITH THE VERY LOUDEST VOICE OF ALL WAS TO BE ON TOP
5154-26558-0020 AND HE WAS TO SHOUT HIS VERY LOUDEST TO THE SUN AND ASK THE SUN TO COME AND HELP THE BIGGEST MONKEY OUT OF HIS DREADFUL DIFFICULTY THIS IS WHAT ALL THE BIG SIZED LITTLE SIZED MIDDLE SIZED MONKEYS DID
5154-26558-0021 THE MONKEY WITH THE LOUDEST VOICE ON TOP OF THE PYRAMID MADE THE SUN HEAR THE SUN CAME AT ONCE THE SUN POURED HIS HOTTEST RAYS DOWN UPON THE WAX
5154-26558-0022 THE MONKEY WAS AT LAST ABLE TO PULL OUT ONE OF HIS HANDS THE SUN POURED DOWN MORE OF HIS HOTTEST RAYS AND SOON THE MONKEY WAS ABLE TO PULL OUT HIS TWO HANDS THEN HE COULD PULL OUT ONE FOOT THEN ANOTHER AND IN A LITTLE WHILE HIS BODY TOO
5154-26558-0023 AT LAST HE WAS FREE WHEN THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN SAW WHAT HAD HAPPENED
5154-26558-0024 SHE DECIDED TO MOVE TO ANOTHER PART OF THE WORLD WHERE SHE RAISED CABBAGES INSTEAD OF BANANAS THE MONKEYS WERE LEFT IN POSSESSION OF THE BIG GARDEN FULL OF BANANA TREES
5154-26559-0000 HOW THE MONKEY ESCAPED BEING EATEN ONCE UPON A TIME
5154-26559-0001 THEN THERE CAME A TIME WHEN THE FRUITS AND NUTS BECAME SCARCE PEOPLE HAD TO EAT MEAT SO THEY BEGAN KILLING THE VARIOUS BEASTS TO SEE WHICH ONES WERE THE BEST TO EAT THEY SKINNED THEM AND CUT THEM IN PIECES AND COOKED THEM OVER THE FIRE
5154-26559-0002 SOME OF THE BEASTS WERE GOOD TO EAT AND OTHERS WERE NOT GOOD AT ALL THE OX WAS FOUND TO BE VERY GOOD
5154-26559-0003 THE MONKEY WAS PLAYING HIS GUITAR
5154-26559-0004 ALL THE TIME THE MAN WAS COMING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE MONKEY JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO STRETCH OUT HIS HAND AND SEIZE THE MONKEY THE MONKEY GAVE A SUDDEN LEAP TO THE TREE AND HURRIED AWAY TO THE TREE TOP AFTER THAT
5154-26559-0005 EVERY TIME THE MAN HEARD THE MONKEY PLAY THE GUITAR HE WOULD COME NEAR AND TRY TO CATCH HIM THE MONKEY GREW AFRAID OF THE MAN SO AFRAID THAT HE GAVE UP PLAYING HIS GUITAR AT ALL
5154-26559-0006 ONE DAY HE FELT THAT HE JUST MUST HAVE SOME MUSIC HE HID IN A HOLE IN THE GROUND AND THERE HE PLAYED UPON HIS GUITAR HE DID NOT THINK THAT THE MAN WOULD HEAR HIM BUT THE MAN HAD VERY SHARP EARS
5154-26559-0007 WHEN HE GOT THROUGH PLAYING HE STARTED TO COME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE GROUND THERE WAS THE MAN WAITING FOR HIM HE CRAWLED QUICKLY BACK
5154-26559-0008 THE MONKEY WAITED AND WAITED FOR THE MAN TO GO AWAY BUT THE MAN DID NOT GO AWAY AFTER A WHILE THE MAN BECAME THIRSTY AND WENT TO GET A DRINK HE LEFT HIS LITTLE BOY IN HIS PLACE TO WATCH FOR THE MONKEY
5154-26559-0009 JUST PUT YOUR EYES DOWN TO THE DOOR OF MY LITTLE CAVE AND I'LL LET YOU SEE THE MONKEY DANCE LITTLE BOY SAID THE MONKEY THE LITTLE BOY PUT HIS EYES DOWN CLOSE TO THE HOLE IN THE GROUND
5154-26559-0010 WHEN THE LITTLE BOY WAS RUBBING HIS EYES TO GET THE DIRT OUT OF THEM THE MONKEY MADE A SUDDEN DASH OUT OF THE CAVE AND ESCAPED TO THE TREE TOPS WHEN THE MAN RETURNED THE LITTLE BOY DID NOT DARE TO TELL HIM THAT THE MONKEY HAD ESCAPED THE MAN WAITED AND WAITED AND WAITED
5154-26559-0011 THERE BY THE HOLE IN THE GROUND AT LAST HE BECAME TIRED OF WAITING AND WENT AWAY AFTER THAT THE MAN TRIED HARDER THAN EVER TO CATCH THE MONKEY
5154-26559-0012 ONE DAY HOWEVER HE CAUGHT THE MONKEY NAPPING HE SHUT HIM UP IN A BOX AND CARRIED HIM HOME TO THE CHILDREN FOR SUPPER THE MAN PUT A BIG DISH FULL OF WATER OVER THE FIRE READY TO COOK THE MONKEY
5154-26559-0013 THE MONKEY AND HIS GUITAR WERE SHUT UP IN THE BOX AND THERE INSIDE THE BOX THE MONKEY PLAYED ON HIS GUITAR
5154-26559-0014 THE CHILDREN CAME CROWDING CLOSE TO THE BOX O CHILDREN O CHILDREN SAID THE MONKEY DON'T YOU WISH THAT YOU COULD SEE THE MONKEY DANCE THE CHILDREN REPLIED THAT THEY WISHED THEY COULD
5154-26559-0015 SAID THE MONKEY JUST LET ME OUT AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW WELL I CAN DANCE
5154-26559-0016 SO THEY LET THE MONKEY FILL THE POT AS HE LIKED HE PUT INTO IT SOME LITTLE DRY STICKS AND AN EMPTY COCOANUT SHELL THEN HE SAID O CHILDREN O CHILDREN I CANNOT DANCE ANY MORE IT IS SO HOT HERE IN THIS ROOM THE CHILDREN
5154-26559-0017 BEGGED HIM TO DANCE SOME MORE IF YOU WILL OPEN THE DOOR A LITTLE BIT SO THAT I CAN HAVE MORE AIR TO BREATHE I'LL SHOW YOU A NEW DANCE SAID THE MONKEY THE CHILDREN OPENED THE DOOR
5154-26559-0018 THE MONKEY DANCED OVER TO THE DOOR AND OUT OF THE DOOR AWAY TO THE TREE TOP THAT WAS THE LAST THEY EVER SAW OF HIM HE MOVED TO ANOTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY AFTER THAT EXPERIENCE
5154-26559-0019 DARE TO TELL HIM THAT THE MONKEY HAD ESCAPED THEY LET HIM THINK THAT THE STICKS AND THE COCOANUT SHELL IN THE POT WAS THE MONKEY
5154-26559-0020 AFTER THE POT HAD BOILED A WHILE HE CALLED THE CHILDREN TO COME TO SUPPER WITH HIM THE CHILDREN LET HIM TASTE FIRST HE FISHED A HARD STICK OUT OF THE POT AND BIT INTO IT
5154-26559-0021 THIS IS NOT THE MONKEY'S LEG IT IS JUST A DRY STICK HE SAID AS HE MADE A WRY FACE THEN HE FISHED THE EMPTY COCOANUT SHELL OUT OF THE POT THAT IS NOT THE MONKEY'S HEAD HE SAID AS HE TASTED IT
5154-26559-0022 THAT IS JUST AN EMPTY COCOANUT SHELL HE COULDN'T FIND A SINGLE TRACE OF THE MONKEY IN THAT MONKEY STEW
5154-6174-0000 MEANTIME THE WISE WOMAN WAS BUSY AS SHE ALWAYS WAS AND HER BUSINESS NOW WAS WITH THE CHILD OF THE SHEPHERD AND SHEPHERDESS AWAY IN THE NORTH HER NAME WAS AGNES HER FATHER AND MOTHER WERE POOR AND COULD NOT GIVE HER MANY THINGS
5154-6174-0001 ROSAMOND WOULD HAVE UTTERLY DESPISED THE RUDE SIMPLE PLAYTHINGS SHE HAD YET IN ONE RESPECT THEY WERE OF MORE VALUE FAR THAN HERS THE KING BOUGHT ROSAMOND'S WITH HIS MONEY
5154-6174-0003 SHE PLAYED WITH THE TOYS HER FATHER MADE HER AND THOUGHT THEM THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS IN THE WORLD WINDMILLS AND LITTLE CROOKS AND WATER WHEELS AND SOMETIMES LAMBS MADE ALL OF WOOL AND DOLLS MADE OUT OF THE LEG BONES OF SHEEP WHICH HER MOTHER DRESSED FOR HER
5154-6174-0004 AND OF SUCH PLAYTHINGS SHE WAS NEVER TIRED SOMETIMES HOWEVER SHE PREFERRED PLAYING WITH STONES WHICH WERE PLENTIFUL AND FLOWERS WHICH WERE FEW OR THE BROOKS THAT RAN DOWN THE HILL OF WHICH
5154-6174-0005 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE MANY SHE COULD ONLY PLAY WITH ONE AT A TIME AND THAT INDEED TROUBLED HER A LITTLE OR LIVE LAMBS THAT WERE NOT ALL WOOL OR THE SHEEP DOGS WHICH WERE VERY FRIENDLY WITH HER AND THE BEST OF PLAYFELLOWS AS SHE THOUGHT FOR SHE HAD NO HUMAN ONES TO COMPARE THEM WITH
5154-6174-0006 NEITHER WAS SHE GREEDY AFTER NICE THINGS BUT CONTENT AS WELL SHE MIGHT BE WITH THE HOMELY FOOD PROVIDED FOR HER NOR WAS SHE BY NATURE PARTICULARLY SELF WILLED OR DISOBEDIENT SHE GENERALLY DID WHAT HER FATHER AND MOTHER WISHED AND BELIEVED WHAT THEY TOLD HER
5154-6174-0007 BUT BY DEGREES THEY HAD SPOILED HER AND THIS WAS THE WAY THEY WERE SO PROUD OF HER THAT THEY ALWAYS REPEATED EVERY THING SHE SAID AND TOLD EVERY THING SHE DID EVEN WHEN SHE WAS PRESENT
5154-6174-0008 AND SO FULL OF ADMIRATION OF THEIR CHILD WERE THEY THAT THEY WONDERED AND LAUGHED AT AND PRAISED THINGS IN HER WHICH IN ANOTHER CHILD WOULD NEVER HAVE STRUCK THEM AS THE LEAST REMARKABLE AND SOME THINGS EVEN
5154-6174-0009 WHICH WOULD IN ANOTHER HAVE DISGUSTED THEM ALTOGETHER IMPERTINENT AND RUDE THINGS DONE BY THEIR CHILD THEY THOUGHT SO CLEVER LAUGHING AT THEM AS SOMETHING QUITE MARVELLOUS
5154-6174-0010 HER COMMONPLACE SPEECHES WERE SAID OVER AGAIN AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THE FINEST POETRY AND THE PRETTY WAYS WHICH EVERY MODERATELY GOOD CHILD HAS WERE EXTOLLED AS IF THE RESULT OF HER EXCELLENT TASTE AND THE CHOICE OF HER JUDGMENT AND WILL
5154-6174-0011 THEY WOULD EVEN SAY SOMETIMES THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HEAR HER OWN PRAISES FOR FEAR IT SHOULD MAKE HER VAIN AND THEN WHISPER THEM BEHIND THEIR HANDS BUT SO LOUD THAT SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO HEAR EVERY WORD THE CONSEQUENCE WAS
5154-6174-0012 THAT SHE SOON CAME TO BELIEVE SO SOON THAT SHE COULD NOT RECALL THE TIME WHEN SHE DID NOT BELIEVE AS THE MOST ABSOLUTE FACT IN THE UNIVERSE THAT SHE WAS SOMEBODY THAT IS SHE BECAME MOST IMMODERATELY CONCEITED
5154-6174-0013 NOW AS THE LEAST ATOM OF CONCEIT IS A THING TO BE ASHAMED OF YOU MAY FANCY WHAT SHE WAS LIKE WITH SUCH A QUANTITY OF IT INSIDE HER AT FIRST IT DID NOT SHOW ITSELF OUTSIDE IN ANY VERY ACTIVE FORM
5154-6174-0014 BUT THE WISE WOMAN HAD BEEN TO THE COTTAGE AND HAD SEEN HER SITTING ALONE WITH SUCH A SMILE OF SELF SATISFACTION UPON HER FACE AS WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE STARTLING TO HER IF SHE HAD EVER BEEN STARTLED AT ANY THING FOR THROUGH THAT SMILE
5154-6174-0015 SHE COULD SEE LYING AT THE ROOT OF IT THE WORM THAT MADE IT FOR SOME SMILES ARE LIKE THE RUDDINESS OF CERTAIN APPLES WHICH IS OWING TO A CENTIPEDE OR
5154-6174-0016 ONLY HER WORM HAD A FACE AND
5154-6174-0017 VERY IMAGE OF HER OWN AND SHE LOOKED SO SIMPERING AND MAWKISH AND SELF CONSCIOUS AND SILLY THAT SHE MADE THE WISE WOMAN FEEL RATHER SICK NOT THAT THE CHILD WAS A FOOL
5154-6174-0018 HAD SHE BEEN THE WISE WOMAN WOULD HAVE ONLY PITIED AND LOVED HER INSTEAD OF FEELING SICK WHEN SHE LOOKED AT HER SHE HAD VERY FAIR ABILITIES AND WERE SHE ONCE BUT MADE HUMBLE WOULD BE CAPABLE NOT ONLY OF DOING A GOOD DEAL IN TIME
5154-6174-0019 BUT OF BEGINNING AT ONCE TO GROW TO NO END BUT IF SHE WERE NOT MADE HUMBLE HER GROWING WOULD BE TO A MASS OF DISTORTED SHAPES ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER SO THAT ALTHOUGH THE BODY SHE NOW SHOWED MIGHT GROW UP STRAIGHT AND WELL SHAPED AND COMELY TO BEHOLD
5154-6174-0020 THE NEW BODY THAT WAS GROWING INSIDE OF IT AND WOULD COME OUT OF IT WHEN SHE DIED WOULD BE UGLY AND CROOKED THIS WAY AND THAT LIKE AN AGED HAWTHORN THAT HAS LIVED HUNDREDS OF YEARS EXPOSED UPON ALL SIDES TO SALT SEA WINDS
5154-6174-0021 AS TIME WENT ON THIS DISEASE OF SELF CONCEIT WENT ON TOO GRADUALLY DEVOURING THE GOOD THAT WAS IN HER FOR THERE IS NO FAULT THAT DOES NOT BRING ITS BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND COUSINS TO LIVE WITH IT
5154-6174-0022 BY DEGREES FROM THINKING HERSELF SO CLEVER SHE CAME TO FANCY THAT WHATEVER SEEMED TO HER MUST OF COURSE BE THE CORRECT JUDGMENT AND WHATEVER SHE WISHED THE RIGHT THING AND GREW SO OBSTINATE
5154-6174-0023 THAT AT LENGTH HER PARENTS FEARED TO THWART HER IN ANY THING KNOWING WELL THAT SHE WOULD NEVER GIVE IN BUT THERE ARE VICTORIES FAR WORSE THAN DEFEATS AND TO OVERCOME AN ANGEL TOO GENTLE TO PUT OUT ALL HIS STRENGTH
5154-6174-0024 AND RIDE AWAY IN TRIUMPH ON THE BACK OF A DEVIL IS ONE OF THE POOREST SO LONG AS SHE WAS LEFT TO TAKE HER OWN WAY AND DO AS SHE WOULD SHE GAVE HER PARENTS LITTLE TROUBLE SHE WOULD PLAY ABOUT BY HERSELF IN THE LITTLE GARDEN WITH ITS FEW HARDY FLOWERS
5154-6174-0025 OR AMONGST THE HEATHER WHERE THE BEES WERE BUSY OR SHE WOULD WANDER AWAY AMONGST THE HILLS AND BE NOBODY KNEW WHERE SOMETIMES FROM MORNING TO NIGHT NOR DID HER PARENTS VENTURE TO FIND FAULT WITH HER SHE NEVER WENT INTO RAGES LIKE THE PRINCESS
5154-6174-0026 BUT SHE WAS NO BETTER FOR ALL THAT AND WAS QUITE AS UGLY IN THE EYES OF THE WISE WOMAN WHO COULD NOT ONLY SEE BUT READ HER FACE
5154-6174-0027 AND ONE DISTORTED TO SILLINESS BY SELF COMPLACENCY TRUE THERE IS MORE HOPE OF HELPING THE ANGRY CHILD OUT OF HER FORM OF SELFISHNESS THAN THE CONCEITED CHILD OUT OF HERS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE CONCEITED CHILD
5154-6174-0028 WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE OR DANGEROUS AS THE WRATHFUL ONE THE CONCEITED ONE HOWEVER WAS SOMETIMES VERY ANGRY AND THEN HER ANGER WAS MORE SPITEFUL THAN THE OTHER'S AND AGAIN THE WRATHFUL ONE WAS OFTEN VERY CONCEITED TOO
5154-6174-0029 SO THAT ON THE WHOLE OF TWO VERY UNPLEASANT CREATURES I WOULD SAY THAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WORSE HAD NOT THE SHEPHERD'S BEEN QUITE AS BAD BUT AS I HAVE SAID
5154-6174-0030 THE WISE WOMAN HAD HER EYE UPON HER SHE SAW THAT SOMETHING SPECIAL MUST BE DONE ELSE SHE WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE WHO KNEEL TO THEIR OWN SHADOWS TILL FEET GROW ON THEIR KNEES THEN GO DOWN ON THEIR HANDS TILL THEIR HANDS GROW INTO FEET
5154-6174-0031 THEN LAY THEIR FACES ON THE GROUND TILL THEY GROW INTO SNOUTS WHEN AT LAST THEY ARE A HIDEOUS SORT OF LIZARDS EACH OF WHICH BELIEVES HIMSELF THE BEST WISEST AND LOVELIEST BEING IN THE WORLD YEA THE VERY CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE
5154-6174-0032 AND SO THEY RUN ABOUT FOREVER LOOKING FOR THEIR OWN SHADOWS THAT THEY MAY WORSHIP THEM AND MISERABLE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT FIND THEM BEING THEMSELVES TOO NEAR THE GROUND TO HAVE ANY SHADOWS AND WHAT BECOMES OF THEM AT LAST THERE IS BUT ONE WHO KNOWS
5154-6174-0033 THE WISE WOMAN THEREFORE ONE DAY WALKED UP TO THE DOOR OF THE SHEPHERD'S COTTAGE DRESSED LIKE A POOR WOMAN AND ASKED FOR A DRINK OF WATER THE SHEPHERD'S WIFE LOOKED AT HER LIKED HER AND BROUGHT HER A CUP OF MILK
5154-6174-0034 THE WISE WOMAN TOOK IT FOR SHE MADE IT A RULE TO ACCEPT EVERY KINDNESS THAT WAS OFFERED HER AGNES WAS NOT BY NATURE A GREEDY GIRL AS I HAVE SAID BUT SELF CONCEIT WILL GO FAR TO GENERATE EVERY OTHER VICE UNDER THE SUN
5154-6174-0035 VANITY WHICH IS A FORM OF SELF CONCEIT HAS REPEATEDLY SHOWN ITSELF AS THE DEEPEST FEELING IN THE HEART OF A HORRIBLE MURDERESS THAT MORNING AT BREAKFAST HER MOTHER HAD STINTED HER IN MILK JUST A LITTLE
5154-6174-0036 THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE SOME MILK PORRIDGE FOR THEIR DINNER AGNES DID NOT MIND IT AT THE TIME BUT WHEN SHE SAW THE MILK NOW GIVEN TO A BEGGAR AS SHE CALLED THE WISE WOMAN
5154-6174-0037 AND ACCEPT A DRAUGHT OF MILK WITHOUT BEING A BEGGAR IN ANY SUCH SENSE AS AGNES'S CONTEMPTUOUS USE OF THE WORD IMPLIED A CLOUD CAME UPON HER FOREHEAD
5154-6174-0038 AND A DOUBLE VERTICAL WRINKLE SETTLED OVER HER NOSE THE WISE WOMAN SAW IT FOR ALL HER BUSINESS WAS WITH AGNES THOUGH SHE LITTLE KNEW IT AND RISING WENT AND OFFERED THE CUP TO THE CHILD WHERE SHE SAT WITH HER KNITTING IN A CORNER
5154-6174-0039 AGNES LOOKED AT IT DID NOT WANT IT WAS INCLINED TO REFUSE IT FROM A BEGGAR BUT THINKING IT WOULD SHOW HER CONSEQUENCE TO ASSERT HER RIGHTS TOOK IT AND DRANK IT UP
5154-6174-0040 FOR WHOEVER IS POSSESSED BY A DEVIL JUDGES WITH THE MIND OF THAT DEVIL AND HENCE AGNES WAS GUILTY OF SUCH A MEANNESS AS MANY WHO ARE THEMSELVES CAPABLE OF SOMETHING JUST AS BAD WILL CONSIDER INCREDIBLE THE WISE WOMAN WAITED
5154-6174-0041 TILL SHE HAD FINISHED IT THEN LOOKING INTO THE EMPTY CUP SAID YOU MIGHT HAVE GIVEN ME BACK AS MUCH AS YOU HAD NO CLAIM UPON AGNES TURNED AWAY AND MADE NO ANSWER FAR LESS FROM SHAME THAN INDIGNATION
5154-6174-0042 THE WISE WOMAN LOOKED AT THE MOTHER YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE OFFERED IT TO HER IF YOU DID NOT MEAN HER TO HAVE IT SAID THE MOTHER SIDING WITH THE DEVIL IN HER CHILD AGAINST THE WISE WOMAN AND HER CHILD TOO SOME FOOLISH PEOPLE THINK THEY TAKE ANOTHER'S PART
5154-6174-0043 WHEN THEY TAKE THE PART HE TAKES THE WISE WOMAN SAID NOTHING BUT FIXED HER EYES UPON HER AND SOON THE MOTHER HID HER FACE IN HER APRON WEEPING THEN SHE TURNED AGAIN TO AGNES WHO HAD NEVER LOOKED ROUND BUT SAT WITH HER BACK TO BOTH
5154-6174-0044 AND SUDDENLY LAPPED HER IN THE FOLDS OF HER CLOAK WHEN THE MOTHER AGAIN LIFTED HER EYES SHE HAD VANISHED
5154-6174-0045 UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID TO THE POOR WOMAN THE MOTHER WENT TO THE DOOR AND CALLED AFTER HER AS SHE TOILED SLOWLY UP THE HILL BUT SHE NEVER TURNED HER HEAD AND THE MOTHER WENT BACK INTO HER COTTAGE
5154-6174-0046 THE WISE WOMAN WALKED CLOSE PAST THE SHEPHERD AND HIS DOGS AND THROUGH THE MIDST OF HIS FLOCK OF SHEEP THE SHEPHERD WONDERED WHERE SHE COULD BE GOING RIGHT UP THE HILL
5154-6174-0047 AND HE FOLLOWED HER WITH HIS EYES AS SHE WENT UP AND UP IT WAS NEAR SUNSET AND AS THE SUN WENT DOWN A GRAY CLOUD SETTLED ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN WHICH HIS LAST RAYS TURNED INTO A ROSY GOLD
5154-6174-0048 STRAIGHT INTO THIS CLOUD THE SHEPHERD SAW THE WOMAN HOLD HER PACE AND IN IT SHE VANISHED HE LITTLE IMAGINED THAT HIS CHILD WAS UNDER HER CLOAK HE WENT HOME AS USUAL IN THE EVENING BUT AGNES HAD NOT COME IN
5154-6174-0049 THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH AN ABSENCE NOW AND THEN AND WERE NOT AT FIRST FRIGHTENED BUT WHEN IT GREW DARK AND SHE DID NOT APPEAR THE HUSBAND SET OUT WITH HIS DOGS IN ONE DIRECTION AND THE WIFE IN ANOTHER TO SEEK THEIR CHILD
5154-6174-0050 MORNING CAME AND THEY HAD NOT FOUND HER THEN THE WHOLE COUNTRY SIDE AROSE TO SEARCH FOR THE MISSING AGNES BUT DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT PASSED AND NOTHING WAS DISCOVERED OF OR CONCERNING HER
5154-6174-0051 UNTIL AT LENGTH ALL GAVE UP THE SEARCH IN DESPAIR EXCEPT THE MOTHER ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NEARLY CONVINCED NOW THAT THE POOR WOMAN HAD CARRIED HER OFF ONE DAY
5154-6174-0052 SHE HAD WANDERED SOME DISTANCE FROM HER COTTAGE THINKING SHE MIGHT COME UPON THE REMAINS OF HER DAUGHTER AT THE FOOT OF SOME CLIFF WHEN SHE CAME SUDDENLY INSTEAD UPON A DISCONSOLATE LOOKING CREATURE SITTING ON A STONE BY THE SIDE OF A STREAM
5154-6174-0053 HER HAIR HUNG IN TANGLES FROM HER HEAD HER CLOTHES WERE TATTERED AND THROUGH THE RENTS HER SKIN SHOWED IN MANY PLACES HER CHEEKS WERE WHITE AND WORN THIN WITH HUNGER THE HOLLOWS WERE DARK UNDER HER EYES AND THEY STOOD OUT SCARED AND WILD
5154-6174-0054 AT FIRST SIGHT THE MOTHER HAD TAKEN HER FOR HER OWN CHILD
5154-6174-0055 FULL OF COMPASSION NEVERTHELESS SHE SAID TO HERSELF IF SHE IS NOT MY AGNES SHE IS AS MUCH IN NEED OF HELP AS IF SHE WERE IF I CANNOT BE GOOD TO MY OWN
5154-6174-0056 I WILL BE AS GOOD AS I CAN TO SOME OTHER WOMAN'S AND THOUGH I SHOULD SCORN TO BE CONSOLED FOR THE LOSS OF ONE BY THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER I YET MAY FIND SOME GLADNESS IN RESCUING ONE CHILD FROM THE DEATH WHICH HAS TAKEN THE OTHER
5154-6174-0057 PERHAPS HER WORDS WERE NOT JUST LIKE THESE BUT HER THOUGHTS WERE SHE TOOK UP THE CHILD AND CARRIED HER HOME
5157-47237-0000 PERSANO FRIDAY NIGHT

5157-47239-0003 THAT THE WORST CONSTRUCTION IS PUT UPON THE MOST INNOCENT ACTIONS AS THIS DINNER MUST BE
5157-47239-0004 I HAVE SENT HIM AN INVITATION IN SHORT WE WILL GET RID OF IT AS WELL AS WE CAN AND GUARD AGAINST ITS PRODUCING MORE MEETINGS OF THE SAME SORT EMMA WOULD REALLY HAVE GONE ANY LENGTHS TO HAVE AVOIDED SUNDAY'S DINNER

5157-47239-0009 WITHOUT MAKING UP FOR MY LOSSES UPON THE WHOLE THEN I DO NOT EXPECT TO GET MORE THAN THE NETT ANNUITY ABOVE MENTIONED AND THE EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS BUT UNLESS THAT IS GRANTED

5157-47239-0012 AND MINE WILL COME LATE ADIEU MY VERY DEAR LORD MAY HEALTH AND SUCCESS ATTEND YOU WHEREVER YOU GO AND I FLATTER MYSELF THIS POLITICAL JUMBLE
5157-47239-0013 YOUR LORDSHIP'S EVER OBLIGED AND MOST SINCERELY ATTACHED FRIEND AND SERVANT WM HAMILTON

5157-47239-0016 EIGHTEEN O ONE MY VERY DEAR LORD I WISH IT WAS IN MY POWER TO PROFIT OF YOUR KIND INVITATION
5157-47239-0017 AND WHICH I THOUGHT SURELY LOST ON BOARD THE COLOSSUS IT HAS COMFORTED ME MUCH WE REMAIN IN THE SAME CRUEL STATE WITH RESPECT TO THE KING'S RECOVERY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT BUT THAT HIS MAJESTY IS BETTER
5157-47239-0018 HOWEVER IF MY CONJECTURES ARE TRUE THE REGENCY MUST SOON TAKE PLACE AS IT MAY BE LONG BEFORE HIS MAJESTY COULD BE TROUBLED WITH BUSINESS SUPPOSING EVEN HIS FEVER TO HAVE TOTALLY SUBSIDED
5157-47239-0019 THE CERTAINTY OF THE FRENCH SQUADRON'S BEING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN GOD KNOWS HOW ALL THIS WILL END BUT I HOPE IT WILL BE YOUR LORDSHIP'S LOT TO BRING PAUL TO HIS SENSES GOD SEND YOU EVERY SUCCESS AND SEND YOU HOME
5157-47239-0020 SAFE AND WELL CROWNED WITH ADDITIONAL LAURELS AND THEN I HOPE YOU WILL REPOSE YOUR SHATTERED FRAME AND MAKE YOUR FRIENDS HAPPY BY STAYING WITH THEM
5157-47239-0021 BUT NOT QUITE FREE FROM BILE EVER MY DEAR LORD YOUR LORDSHIP'S MOST ATTACHED AND ETERNALLY OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT WM HAMILTON
5157-47239-0022 AND READ IN YOUR OWN HAND THAT GOD HAD NOT ONLY GRANTED YOU COMPLETE SUCCESS AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF OUR COUNTRY
5157-47239-0023 PREVENTED YOUR RECEIVING THE SMALLEST SCRATCH WE CAN ONLY REPEAT WHAT WE KNEW WELL AND OFTEN SAID BEFORE THAT NELSON WAS IS AND TO THE LAST WILL EVER BE THE FIRST HOWEVER
5157-47239-0024 WE ALL AGREE THAT WHEN WE GET YOU SAFE HOME ONCE MORE THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER MORE RISK YOUR SHATTERED FRAME YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH AND ARE WELL ENTITLED TO THE MOTTO OF VIRGIL
5157-47239-0025 THE FAMOUS BROUGHTON AFTER HE HAD BEATEN EVERY OPPONENT THAT DARED TO MEASURE HARD BLOWS WITH HIM SET UP AN ALE HOUSE THE BROUGHTON'S HEAD IN LONDON WITH THE ABOVE VERSE OF VIRGIL UNDER IT SOME YEARS AFTER
5157-47239-0026 HE WAS PERSUADED TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE OF A COACHMAN AND WAS BEATEN NOT THAT I MEAN TO CONVEY THAT ANY SUCH THING COULD HAPPEN TO YOUR LORDSHIP BUT YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH LET OTHERS FOLLOW YOUR EXAMPLES
5157-47239-0027 THEY WILL BE REMEMBERED TO THE LATEST POSTERITY IT APPEARED TO ME MOST EXTRAORDINARY THAT THE SIXTH INST THE DATE OF YOUR LAST LETTER TO EMMA THE DEATH OF THE EMPEROR PAUL WHICH WE HAVE NO DOUBT OF HERE
5157-47239-0028 SHOULD NOT BE KNOWN AT COPENHAGEN IT APPEARS TO US THAT AS SOON AS THAT GREAT EVENT IS KNOWN IN SWEDEN AND DENMARK
5157-47239-0029 THE FORMIDABLE GIANT NORTHERN COALITION WILL OF ITSELF FALL TO PIECES
5157-47239-0030 IN A VERY SHORT TIME YOU WOULD HAVE LAUGHED TO HAVE SEEN WHAT I SAW YESTERDAY EMMA DID NOT KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS ON HER HEAD OR HEELS IN SUCH A HURRY TO TELL YOUR GREAT NEWS
5157-47239-0031 THAT SHE COULD UTTER NOTHING BUT TEARS OF JOY AND TENDERNESS I WENT TO DAVISON YESTERDAY MORNING AND FOUND HIM STILL IN BED HAVING HAD A SEVERE FIT OF THE GOUT AND WITH YOUR LETTER WHICH HE HAD JUST RECEIVED AND HE CRIED LIKE A CHILD
5157-47239-0032 BUT WHAT WAS VERY EXTRAORDINARY ASSURED ME THAT FROM THE INSTANT HE HAD READ YOUR LETTER ALL PAIN HAD LEFT HIM AND THAT HE FELT HIMSELF ABLE TO GET UP AND WALK ABOUT YOUR BROTHER
5157-47239-0033 MISSUS NELSON AND HORACE DINED WITH US YOUR BROTHER WAS MORE EXTRAORDINARY THAN EVER HE WOULD GET UP SUDDENLY AND CUT A CAPER RUBBING HIS HANDS EVERY TIME THAT THE THOUGHT OF YOUR FRESH LAURELS CAME INTO HIS HEAD
5157-47239-0034 BUT I AM SURE THAT NO ONE REALLY REJOICED MORE AT HEART THAN I DID I HAVE LIVED TOO LONG TO HAVE EXTACIES BUT WITH CALM REFLECTION I FELT FOR MY FRIEND HAVING GOT TO THE VERY SUMMIT OF GLORY
5157-47239-0035 ENEMIES YOU HAVE NONE BUT THOSE THAT ARE BURSTING WITH ENVY AND SUCH ANIMALS INFEST ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD THE KING BE ASSURED IS THOUGH WEAK GETTING WELL FAST LORD LOUGHBOROUGH TOLD LIVINGSTON WHO HAS JUST BEEN HERE
5157-47239-0036 THAT HE WAS WITH THE KING THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY BEFORE AND AFTER DELIVERY OF THE SEALS AND THAT HE WAS PERFECTLY CALM AND RECOLLECTED EVER YOUR SINCERELY ATTACHED AND TRULY OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT WM HAMILTON
5157-47239-0037 YOU HAVE ALREADY CALMED THE MINDS OF EVERY BODY WITH RESPECT TO THE THREATENED FRENCH INVASION IN SHORT ALL YOUR LORDSHIP DOES IS COMPLETE LIKE YOURSELF AND NOBODY ELSE
5157-47239-0038 BUT STILL I THINK THERE IS NO OCCASION FOR THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF TO EXPOSE HIS PERSON AS MUCH AS YOU DO WHY SHOULD YOU NOT HAVE A PRIVATE FLAG KNOWN TO YOUR FLEET AND NOT TO THE ENEMY WHEN YOU SHIFT IT AND GO RECONNOITRING
5157-47239-0039 CAPTAIN HOPKINS GOING FROM HENCE IN THE SPEEDWELL CUTTER TO JOIN YOUR LORDSHIP WILL BE HAPPY TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF TO YOU BY PRESENTING THIS LETTER HIMSELF THEY GIVE HIM A GOOD CHARACTER IN THIS COUNTRY
5157-47239-0040 BUT MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM IS BUT OF TWO DAYS I WAS YESTERDAY WITH CAPTAIN DOBBINS IN THE DILIGENCE CUTTER WE SAILED OUT OF THIS GLORIOUS HARBOUR AND THE DAY BEING FINE SAILED OUT SOME LEAGUES AND EXAMINED THE CROW ROCK
5157-47239-0041 WHICH IS RECKONED THE GREATEST DANGER AS TO ENTERING THE HARBOUR BUT THE TWO LIGHT HOUSES LATELY ERECTED TAKE OFF ALL DANGER IN THE NIGHT AND IT IS VISIBLE IN THE DAY TIME EXCEPT A SHORT TIME
5157-47239-0042 IN SPRING TIDES I AM DELIGHTED WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS AT MILFORD IT WILL SURELY BE A GREAT TOWN IF WE HAVE PEACE IN THREE YEARS THE HOUSES RISING UP LIKE MUSHROOMS EVEN IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES
5157-47239-0043 I VISITED THE TWO LIGHT HOUSES AND FOUND THEM PERFECTLY CLEAN AND IN GOOD ORDER
5157-47239-0044 AS I THINK IN THE MANNER YOU DISPATCH BUSINESS YOU WILL HAVE COMPLETED ALL BY WEDNESDAY NEXT THE DAY I SHALL PROBABLY BE IN LONDON CHARLES GREVILLE'S KIND COMPLIMENTS THE NAME OF NELSON IS IN EVERY MOUTH
5157-47239-0045 OR WHAT IS I BELIEVE OFTENER THE CASE BY THE IGNORANCE AND MISTAKES OF THE PHYSICIANS THEN INDEED THERE IS REASON TO LAMENT BUT AS IN THE CASE OF YOUR GOOD FATHER
5157-47239-0046 THE LAMP WAS SUFFERED TO BURN OUT FAIRLY AND THAT HIS SUFFERINGS WERE NOT GREAT AND THAT BY HIS SON'S GLORIOUS AND UNPARALLELED SUCCESSES HE SAW HIS FAMILY ENNOBLED AND WITH THE PROBABILITY IN TIME
5157-47239-0047 OF ITS BEING AMPLY REWARDED AS IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LONG AGO HIS MIND COULD NOT BE TROUBLED IN HIS LATTER MOMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF THE FAMILY HE LEFT BEHIND HIM AND AS TO HIS OWN PEACE OF MIND AT THE MOMENT OF HIS DISSOLUTION
5157-47239-0048 THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AMONG THOSE WHO EVER HAD THE HONOUR OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE SAID MORE THAN I INTENDED BUT DARE SAY YOUR LORDSHIP HAD NEARLY THE SAME THOUGHTS WITH THE ADDITION OF THE FEELINGS OF A DUTIFUL SON
5157-47239-0049 FOR THE LOSS OF A MOST EXCELLENT FATHER IT IS HOWEVER NOW AS YOUR LORDSHIP IS THE FATHER OF YOUR FAMILY INCUMBENT UPON YOU TO TAKE PARTICULAR CARE OF YOUR OWN HEALTH
5186-7793-0000 ON SATURDAY APRIL ELEVENTH HE APPOINTED ME TO COME TO HIM IN THE EVENING WHEN HE SHOULD BE AT LEISURE TO GIVE ME SOME ASSISTANCE FOR THE DEFENCE OF HASTIE THE SCHOOLMASTER OF CAMPBELLTOWN FOR WHOM I WAS TO APPEAR IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS
5186-7793-0001 TO DICTATE TO ME WHILE I WROTE AS FOLLOWS THE CHARGE IS THAT HE HAS USED IMMODERATE AND CRUEL CORRECTION CORRECTION IN ITSELF IS NOT CRUEL CHILDREN
5186-7793-0002 AND HAS NEVER BEEN THOUGHT INCONSISTENT WITH PARENTAL TENDERNESS IT IS THE DUTY OF A MASTER WHO IS IN HIS HIGHEST EXALTATION WHEN HE IS LOCO PARENTIS YET AS GOOD THINGS BECOME EVIL BY EXCESS
5186-7793-0003 BUT WHEN IS CORRECTION IMMODERATE WHEN IT IS MORE FREQUENT OR MORE SEVERE THAN IS REQUIRED
5186-7793-0004 ET DOCENDUM FOR REFORMATION AND INSTRUCTION NO SEVERITY IS CRUEL WHICH OBSTINACY MAKES NECESSARY FOR THE GREATEST CRUELTY WOULD BE TO DESIST
5186-7793-0005 AND LEAVE THE SCHOLAR TOO CARELESS FOR INSTRUCTION AND TOO MUCH HARDENED FOR REPROOF LOCKE IN HIS TREATISE OF EDUCATION MENTIONS A MOTHER WITH APPLAUSE WHO WHIPPED AN INFANT EIGHT TIMES
5186-7793-0006 BEFORE SHE HAD SUBDUED IT FOR HAD SHE STOPPED AT THE SEVENTH ACT OF CORRECTION HER DAUGHTER SAYS HE
5186-7793-0007 THERE MUST BE EITHER UNBOUNDED LICENCE OR ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY THE MASTER WHO PUNISHES NOT ONLY CONSULTS THE FUTURE HAPPINESS OF HIM WHO IS THE IMMEDIATE SUBJECT OF CORRECTION BUT HE PROPAGATES OBEDIENCE
5186-7793-0008 THROUGH THE WHOLE SCHOOL AND ESTABLISHES REGULARITY BY EXEMPLARY JUSTICE THE VICTORIOUS OBSTINACY OF A SINGLE BOY WOULD MAKE HIS FUTURE ENDEAVOURS OF REFORMATION OR INSTRUCTION
5186-7793-0009 TOTALLY INEFFECTUAL OBSTINACY THEREFORE MUST NEVER BE VICTORIOUS YET IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THERE SOMETIMES OCCURS A SULLEN AND HARDY RESOLUTION
5186-7793-0010 THAT LAUGHS AT ALL COMMON PUNISHMENT AND BIDS DEFIANCE TO ALL COMMON DEGREES OF PAIN CORRECTION MUST BE PROPORTIONED TO OCCASIONS THE FLEXIBLE WILL BE REFORMED BY GENTLE DISCIPLINE
5186-7793-0011 AND THE REFRACTORY MUST BE SUBDUED BY HARSHER METHODS THE DEGREES OF SCHOLASTICK AS OF MILITARY PUNISHMENT NO STATED RULES CAN ASCERTAIN
5186-7793-0012 IT MUST BE ENFORCED TILL IT OVERPOWERS TEMPTATION TILL STUBBORNNESS BECOMES FLEXIBLE AND PERVERSENESS REGULAR CUSTOM AND REASON
5186-7793-0013 SHALL BE CONSIDERED AS CRIMINAL BUT PUNISHMENTS HOWEVER SEVERE THAT PRODUCE NO LASTING EVIL MAY BE JUST AND REASONABLE BECAUSE THEY MAY BE NECESSARY
5186-7793-0014 SUCH HAVE BEEN THE PUNISHMENTS USED BY THE RESPONDENT NO SCHOLAR HAS GONE FROM HIM EITHER BLIND OR LAME OR WITH ANY OF HIS LIMBS OR POWERS INJURED OR IMPAIRED THEY WERE IRREGULAR AND HE PUNISHED THEM
5186-7793-0015 THEY WERE OBSTINATE AND HE ENFORCED HIS PUNISHMENT BUT HOWEVER PROVOKED HE NEVER EXCEEDED THE LIMITS OF MODERATION FOR HE INFLICTED NOTHING BEYOND PRESENT PAIN AND HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS REQUIRED
5186-7793-0016 NO MAN IS SO LITTLE ABLE TO DETERMINE AS THOSE WHO HAVE DETERMINED AGAINST HIM THE PARENTS OF THE OFFENDERS IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT HE USED UNPRECEDENTED AND IMPROPER INSTRUMENTS OF CORRECTION
5186-7793-0017 OF THIS ACCUSATION THE MEANING IS NOT VERY EASY TO BE FOUND NO INSTRUMENT OF CORRECTION IS MORE PROPER THAN ANOTHER BUT AS IT IS BETTER ADAPTED TO PRODUCE PRESENT PAIN
5186-7793-0018 WITHOUT LASTING MISCHIEF WHATEVER WERE HIS INSTRUMENTS NO LASTING MISCHIEF HAS ENSUED AND THEREFORE HOWEVER UNUSUAL IN HANDS SO CAUTIOUS THEY WERE PROPER
5186-7793-0019 IT HAS BEEN OBJECTED THAT THE RESPONDENT ADMITS THE CHARGE OF CRUELTY BY PRODUCING NO EVIDENCE TO CONFUTE IT LET IT BE CONSIDERED THAT HIS SCHOLARS ARE EITHER DISPERSED AT LARGE IN THE WORLD
5186-7793-0020 OR CONTINUE TO INHABIT THE PLACE IN WHICH THEY WERE BRED THOSE WHO ARE DISPERSED CANNOT BE FOUND THOSE WHO REMAIN ARE THE SONS OF HIS PERSECUTORS AND ARE NOT LIKELY TO SUPPORT A MAN TO WHOM THEIR FATHERS ARE ENEMIES
5186-7793-0021 IF IT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE ENMITY OF THEIR FATHERS PROVES THE JUSTICE OF THE CHARGE IT MUST BE CONSIDERED HOW OFTEN EXPERIENCE SHEWS US THAT MEN WHO ARE ANGRY ON ONE GROUND
5186-7793-0022 WILL ACCUSE ON ANOTHER WITH HOW LITTLE KINDNESS IN A TOWN OF LOW TRADE A MAN WHO LIVES BY LEARNING IS REGARDED AND HOW IMPLICITLY WHERE THE INHABITANTS ARE NOT VERY RICH A RICH MAN IS HEARKENED TO
5186-7793-0023 AND FOLLOWED IN A PLACE LIKE CAMPBELLTOWN IT IS EASY FOR ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL INHABITANTS TO MAKE A PARTY IT IS EASY FOR THAT PARTY TO HEAT THEMSELVES WITH IMAGINARY GRIEVANCES IT IS EASY FOR THEM
5186-7793-0024 TO OPPRESS A MAN POORER THAN THEMSELVES AND NATURAL TO ASSERT THE DIGNITY OF RICHES BY PERSISTING IN OPPRESSION THE ARGUMENT WHICH ATTEMPTS TO PROVE THE IMPROPRIETY OF RESTORING HIM TO THE SCHOOL
5186-7793-0025 BY ALLEDGING THAT HE HAS LOST THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE IS NOT THE SUBJECT OF JURIDICAL CONSIDERATION
5186-7793-0026 NOT FOR THEIR JUDGEMENT BUT FOR HIS OWN ACTIONS IT MAY BE CONVENIENT FOR THEM TO HAVE ANOTHER MASTER BUT IT IS A CONVENIENCE OF THEIR OWN MAKING
5186-7793-0027 CONVENIENT FOR HIM TO FIND ANOTHER SCHOOL BUT THIS CONVENIENCE HE CANNOT OBTAIN THE QUESTION IS NOT WHAT IS NOW CONVENIENT BUT WHAT IS GENERALLY RIGHT
5186-7793-0028 BY TYRANNY WHICH LAW HAS DEFEATED AND BY MALICE WHICH VIRTUE HAS SURMOUNTED THIS SIR SAID HE YOU ARE TO TURN IN YOUR MIND AND MAKE THE BEST USE OF IT YOU CAN IN YOUR SPEECH
5186-7793-0029 OF OUR FRIEND GOLDSMITH HE SAID SIR HE IS SO MUCH AFRAID OF BEING UNNOTICED THAT HE OFTEN TALKS MERELY LEST YOU SHOULD FORGET
5186-7793-0030 THAT HE IS IN THE COMPANY BOSWELL YES HE STANDS FORWARD JOHNSON TRUE SIR BUT IF A MAN IS TO STAND FORWARD HE SHOULD WISH TO DO IT NOT IN AN AUKWARD POSTURE NOT IN RAGS
5186-7793-0031 NOT SO AS THAT HE SHALL ONLY BE EXPOSED TO RIDICULE BOSWELL FOR MY PART I LIKE VERY WELL TO HEAR HONEST GOLDSMITH TALK AWAY CARELESSLY JOHNSON WHY YES SIR BUT
5186-7793-0032 NO SIR WHILE LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS A DISTINCTION THE FEW WHO HAVE THAT DISTINCTION
5186-7793-0033 WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO FOLLOW NATURE AND GO TO BED AND RISE JUST AS NATURE GIVES US LIGHT OR WITH HOLDS IT JOHNSON NO SIR
5186-7793-0034 THAT SOLEMN SEASON WHICH THE CHRISTIAN WORLD HAS APPROPRIATED TO THE COMMEMORATION OF THE MYSTERIES OF OUR REDEMPTION AND DURING WHICH WHATEVER EMBERS OF RELIGION ARE IN OUR BREASTS WILL BE KINDLED
5186-7793-0035 IN HIS PRIVATE REGISTER MY MIND IS UNSETTLED AND MY MEMORY CONFUSED I HAVE OF LATE TURNED MY THOUGHTS WITH A VERY USELESS EARNESTNESS
5186-7793-0036 WHO COULD KNOW CARDS BY THE TOUCH DOCTOR JOHNSON SAID THE CARDS USED BY SUCH PERSONS MUST BE LESS POLISHED THAN OURS COMMONLY ARE WE TALKED OF SOUNDS
5186-7793-0037 THE GENERAL SAID THERE WAS NO BEAUTY IN A SIMPLE SOUND BUT ONLY IN AN HARMONIOUS COMPOSITION OF SOUNDS I PRESUMED TO DIFFER FROM THIS OPINION AND MENTIONED
5186-7793-0038 THE SOFT AND SWEET SOUND OF A FINE WOMAN'S VOICE JOHNSON NO SIR IF A SERPENT OR A TOAD UTTERED IT
5186-7793-0039 BUT NEITHER WILL DENY THAT EACH IS GOOD IN ITS KIND WHILE I REMAINED IN LONDON THIS SPRING I WAS WITH HIM AT SEVERAL OTHER TIMES BOTH BY HIMSELF AND IN COMPANY I DINED WITH HIM ONE DAY
5186-7793-0040 AT THE CROWN AND ANCHOR TAVERN IN THE STRAND WITH LORD ELIBANK MISTER LANGTON AND DOCTOR VANSITTART OF OXFORD WITHOUT SPECIFYING EACH PARTICULAR DAY I HAVE PRESERVED THE FOLLOWING MEMORABLE THINGS
5186-7793-0041 I REGRETTED THE REFLECTION IN HIS PREFACE TO SHAKSPEARE AGAINST GARRICK TO WHOM
5186-7793-0042 THAT GARRICK WANTED TO BE COURTED FOR THEM AND THAT ON THE CONTRARY GARRICK SHOULD HAVE COURTED HIM AND SENT HIM THE PLAYS OF HIS OWN ACCORD BUT INDEED
5186-7793-0043 FOR THAT REASON JOHNSON YES SIR IF HE SAT NEXT YOU I EXPRESSED A LIKING FOR MISTER FRANCIS OSBORNE'S WORKS AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THAT WRITER
5186-7793-0044 HAS AN AIR OF ORIGINALITY
5186-7793-0045 THERE IS NO PERMANENT NATIONAL CHARACTER IT VARIES ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES ALEXANDER THE GREAT SWEPT INDIA NOW THE TURKS SWEEP GREECE A LEARNED GENTLEMAN WHO IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION
5186-7793-0046 WISHED TO INFORM US OF THIS SIMPLE FACT THAT THE COUNSEL UPON THE CIRCUIT AT SHREWSBURY WERE MUCH BITTEN BY FLEAS TOOK I SUPPOSE SEVEN OR EIGHT MINUTES IN RELATING IT CIRCUMSTANTIALLY HE IN A
5186-7793-0047 THAT BY REASON OF THIS FLEAS NESTLED THERE IN PRODIGIOUS NUMBERS THAT THE LODGINGS OF THE COUNSEL WERE NEAR TO THE TOWN HALL AND THAT THOSE LITTLE ANIMALS MOVED FROM PLACE TO PLACE WITH WONDERFUL AGILITY
5186-7793-0048 AND SO HAS A CAT WHEN SHE CATCHES A MOUSE FOR HER KITTEN BUT SHE CANNOT WRITE LIKE
5186-7793-0049 WHO HAD RESIDED LONG IN SPAIN AND WAS UNWILLING TO RETURN TO BRITAIN JOHNSON SIR
5186-7793-0050 DOES CLIMATE BEAR TO THE COMPLEX SYSTEM OF HUMAN LIFE
5186-7793-0051 ON WHOM I HAPPENED TO CALL IN THE MORNING SAID HE WOULD JOIN US WHICH HE DID AND WE SPENT A VERY AGREEABLE DAY THOUGH I RECOLLECT BUT LITTLE OF WHAT PASSED HE SAID
5186-7793-0052 WALPOLE WAS A MINISTER GIVEN BY THE KING TO THE PEOPLE PITT WAS A MINISTER GIVEN BY THE PEOPLE TO THE KING AS AN ADJUNCT THE MISFORTUNE OF GOLDSMITH IN CONVERSATION IS THIS
5186-7793-0053 HE GOES ON WITHOUT KNOWING HOW HE IS TO GET OFF HIS GENIUS IS GREAT BUT HIS KNOWLEDGE IS SMALL AS THEY SAY OF A GENEROUS MAN IT IS A PITY HE IS NOT RICH WE MAY SAY OF GOLDSMITH
5186-7793-0054 IT IS A PITY HE IS NOT KNOWING HE WOULD NOT KEEP HIS KNOWLEDGE TO HIMSELF BEFORE LEAVING LONDON THIS YEAR I CONSULTED HIM UPON A QUESTION PURELY OF SCOTCH LAW IT WAS HELD OF OLD
5186-7793-0055 AND CONTINUED FOR A LONG PERIOD TO BE AN ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE IN THAT LAW THAT WHOEVER INTERMEDDLED WITH THE EFFECTS OF A PERSON DECEASED WITHOUT THE INTERPOSITION OF LEGAL AUTHORITY TO GUARD AGAINST EMBEZZLEMENT
5186-7793-0056 SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO PAY ALL THE DEBTS OF THE DECEASED AS HAVING BEEN GUILTY OF WHAT WAS TECHNICALLY CALLED VICIOUS INTROMISSION THE COURT OF SESSION
5186-7793-0057 WHERE THE INTERFERENCE PROVED
5186-7793-0058 AND MAY THEREFORE BE SUSPENDED OR MODIFIED AS THE COURT SHALL THINK PROPER CONCERNING THE POWER OF THE COURT TO MAKE OR TO SUSPEND A LAW WE HAVE NO INTENTION TO INQUIRE IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR OUR PURPOSE THAT
5186-7793-0059 TO GIVE TO ONE MAN WHAT IN THE SAME CASE IS GIVEN TO ANOTHER THE ADVANTAGE WHICH HUMANITY DERIVES FROM LAW IS THIS THAT THE LAW GIVES EVERY MAN A RULE OF ACTION AND
5186-7793-0061 THAT IT BE PERMANENT AND STABLE THE LAW IS THE MEASURE OF CIVIL RIGHT BUT IF THE MEASURE BE CHANGEABLE THE EXTENT OF THE THING MEASURED NEVER CAN BE SETTLED
5186-7793-0062 BY WHICH THE DEFICIENCIES OF PRIVATE UNDERSTANDING ARE TO BE SUPPLIED IT IS TO SUFFER THE RASH AND IGNORANT TO ACT AT DISCRETION AND THEN TO DEPEND FOR THE LEGALITY OF THAT ACTION ON THE SENTENCE OF THE JUDGE
5186-7793-0063 HE THAT IS THUS GOVERNED LIVES NOT BY LAW BUT BY OPINION NOT BY A CERTAIN RULE TO WHICH HE CAN APPLY HIS INTENTION BEFORE HE ACTS
5186-7793-0064 WHICH HE CAN NEVER KNOW BUT AFTER HE HAS COMMITTED THE ACT ON WHICH THAT OPINION SHALL BE PASSED HE LIVES BY A LAW IF A LAW IT BE
5186-7793-0065 THAT THERE MAY BE INTROMISSION WITHOUT FRAUD WHICH HOWEVER TRUE WILL BY NO MEANS JUSTIFY AN OCCASIONAL AND ARBITRARY RELAXATION OF THE LAW THE END
5186-7793-0066 OF LAW IS PROTECTION AS WELL AS VENGEANCE INDEED VENGEANCE IS NEVER USED BUT TO STRENGTHEN PROTECTION THAT SOCIETY ONLY IS WELL GOVERNED WHERE LIFE IS FREED FROM DANGER AND FROM SUSPICION
5186-7793-0067 WHERE POSSESSION IS SO SHELTERED BY SALUTARY PROHIBITIONS THAT VIOLATION IS PREVENTED MORE FREQUENTLY THAN PUNISHED SUCH A PROHIBITION WAS THIS WHILE IT OPERATED WITH ITS ORIGINAL FORCE
5186-7793-0068 THE CREDITOR OF THE DECEASED WAS NOT ONLY WITHOUT LOSS BUT WITHOUT FEAR HE WAS NOT TO SEEK A REMEDY FOR AN INJURY SUFFERED FOR INJURY WAS WARDED OFF
5186-7793-0069 AS THE LAW HAS BEEN SOMETIMES ADMINISTERED IT LAYS US OPEN TO WOUNDS BECAUSE IT IS IMAGINED TO HAVE THE POWER OF HEALING TO PUNISH FRAUD WHEN IT IS DETECTED
5186-7793-0070 IS THE PROPER ACT OF VINDICTIVE JUSTICE BUT TO PREVENT FRAUDS AND MAKE PUNISHMENT UNNECESSARY IS THE GREAT EMPLOYMENT OF LEGISLATIVE WISDOM TO PERMIT INTROMISSION
5186-7793-0071 ADVENTITIOUS STRENGTH IT LIKEWISE ENLIGHTENS THE IGNORANT WITH EXTRINSICK UNDERSTANDING LAW TEACHES US TO KNOW WHEN WE COMMIT INJURY AND WHEN WE SUFFER IT
5186-7793-0072 IT FIXES CERTAIN MARKS UPON ACTIONS BY WHICH WE ARE ADMONISHED TO DO OR TO FORBEAR THEM
5186-7793-0073 SAYS ONE OF THE FATHERS NUNQUAM
5186-7793-0074 HE WHO NEVER INTROMITS AT ALL WILL NEVER INTROMIT
5186-7793-0075 BEFORE THE FEROCITY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THIS PART OF THE ISLAND WAS SUBDUED THE UTMOST SEVERITY OF THE CIVIL LAW WAS NECESSARY TO RESTRAIN INDIVIDUALS FROM PLUNDERING EACH OTHER THUS THE MAN WHO INTERMEDDLED
5186-7793-0076 IRREGULARLY WITH THE MOVEABLES OF A PERSON DECEASED WAS SUBJECTED TO ALL THE DEBTS OF THE DECEASED WITHOUT LIMITATION THIS MAKES A BRANCH OF THE LAW OF SCOTLAND KNOWN BY THE NAME OF VICIOUS INTROMISSION
5186-7793-0077 WHICH PROVED IN MANY INSTANCES A MOST RIGOROUS PUNISHMENT
5186-7793-0078 IT IS EXTREMELY REMARKABLE THAT IN PROPORTION TO OUR IMPROVEMENT IN MANNERS THIS REGULATION HAS BEEN GRADUALLY SOFTENED AND APPLIED BY OUR SOVEREIGN COURT WITH A SPARING HAND
5186-7793-0079 I FIND MYSELF UNDER A NECESSITY OF OBSERVING THAT THIS LEARNED AND JUDICIOUS WRITER
5186-7793-0080 HAS NOT ACCURATELY DISTINGUISHED THE DEFICIENCIES AND DEMANDS OF THE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OF HUMAN LIFE WHICH FROM A DEGREE OF SAVAGENESS AND INDEPENDENCE IN WHICH ALL LAWS ARE VAIN PASSES OR MAY PASS
5186-7793-0081 BY INNUMERABLE GRADATIONS TO A STATE OF RECIPROCAL BENIGNITY IN WHICH LAWS SHALL BE NO LONGER NECESSARY
5186-7793-0082 LIVING EACH MAN TO HIMSELF TAKING FROM THE WEAK AND LOSING TO THE STRONG IN THEIR FIRST COALITIONS OF SOCIETY
5186-7793-0083 OF GENERAL HAPPINESS THE PRODUCT OF GENERAL CONFIDENCE THERE IS YET NO THOUGHT MEN CONTINUE TO PROSECUTE THEIR OWN ADVANTAGES BY THE NEAREST WAY AND THE UTMOST SEVERITY OF THE CIVIL LAW IS NECESSARY
5186-7793-0084 TO RESTRAIN INDIVIDUALS FROM PLUNDERING EACH OTHER
5186-7793-0085 FROM ACTS OF PUBLICK VIOLENCE
5186-7793-0086 UNDISGUISED OPPRESSION THE FEROCITY OF OUR ANCESTORS AS OF ALL OTHER NATIONS PRODUCED NOT FRAUD
5186-7793-0087 THEY HAD NOT YET LEARNED TO CHEAT AND ATTEMPTED ONLY TO ROB AS MANNERS GROW MORE POLISHED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD MEN ATTAIN LIKEWISE DEXTERITY IN EVIL
5186-7793-0088 THOSE WHO BEFORE INVADED PASTURES AND STORMED HOUSES NOW BEGIN TO ENRICH THEMSELVES BY UNEQUAL CONTRACTS AND FRAUDULENT INTROMISSIONS
5186-7793-0089 IT IS NOT AGAINST THE VIOLENCE OF FEROCITY BUT THE CIRCUMVENTIONS OF DECEIT THAT THIS LAW WAS FRAMED AND I AM AFRAID THE INCREASE OF COMMERCE AND THE INCESSANT STRUGGLE FOR RICHES WHICH COMMERCE EXCITES
5186-7793-0090 GIVE US NO PROSPECT OF AN END SPEEDILY TO BE EXPECTED OF ARTIFICE AND FRAUD IT THEREFORE SEEMS TO BE NO VERY CONCLUSIVE REASONING WHICH CONNECTS THOSE TWO PROPOSITIONS
5186-7793-0091 IT WAS NOT THAT THE NATION WAS GROWN LESS FIERCE AND I AM AFRAID IT CANNOT BE AFFIRMED THAT IT IS GROWN LESS FRAUDULENT
5186-7793-0092 SINCE THIS LAW HAS BEEN REPRESENTED AS RIGOROUSLY AND UNREASONABLY PENAL IT SEEMS NOT IMPROPER TO CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS AND QUALITIES THAT MAKE THE JUSTICE OR PROPRIETY OF A PENAL LAW
5186-7793-0093 TWO CONDITIONS ARE NECESSARY AND TWO PROPER IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE LAW SHOULD BE ADEQUATE TO ITS END THAT IF IT BE OBSERVED IT SHALL PREVENT THE EVIL AGAINST WHICH IT IS DIRECTED
5186-7793-0094 IT IS SECONDLY NECESSARY THAT THE END OF THE LAW BE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE AS TO DESERVE THE SECURITY OF A PENAL SANCTION THE OTHER CONDITIONS OF A PENAL LAW WHICH THOUGH NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
5186-7793-0095 ARE TO A VERY HIGH DEGREE FIT ARE THAT TO THE MORAL VIOLATION OF THE LAW THERE ARE MANY TEMPTATIONS AND THAT OF THE PHYSICAL OBSERVANCE THERE IS GREAT FACILITY
5186-7793-0096 ALL THESE CONDITIONS APPARENTLY CONCUR TO JUSTIFY THE LAW WHICH WE ARE NOW CONSIDERING ITS END IS THE SECURITY OF PROPERTY AND PROPERTY VERY OFTEN OF GREAT VALUE
5186-7793-0097 THE METHOD BY WHICH IT EFFECTS THE SECURITY IS EFFICACIOUS BECAUSE IT ADMITS IN ITS ORIGINAL RIGOUR NO GRADATIONS OF INJURY BUT KEEPS GUILT AND INNOCENCE APART BY A DISTINCT AND DEFINITE LIMITATION
5186-7793-0098 HE THAT INTROMITS IS CRIMINAL HE THAT INTROMITS NOT IS INNOCENT OF THE TWO SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT BOTH ARE IN OUR FAVOUR THE TEMPTATION TO INTROMIT IS FREQUENT AND STRONG
5186-7793-0099 SO STRONG AND SO FREQUENT AS TO REQUIRE THE UTMOST ACTIVITY OF JUSTICE AND VIGILANCE OF CAUTION TO WITHSTAND ITS PREVALENCE AND THE METHOD BY WHICH A MAN MAY ENTITLE HIMSELF TO LEGAL INTROMISSION IS SO OPEN
5186-7793-0100 FOR WHY SHOULD A MAN OMIT TO DO BUT FOR REASONS WHICH HE WILL NOT CONFESS THAT WHICH HE CAN DO SO EASILY AND THAT WHICH HE KNOWS TO BE REQUIRED BY THE LAW IF TEMPTATION WERE RARE
5186-7793-0101 A PENAL LAW MIGHT BE DEEMED UNNECESSARY IF THE DUTY ENJOINED BY THE LAW WERE OF DIFFICULT PERFORMANCE OMISSION THOUGH IT COULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED MIGHT BE PITIED BUT IN THE PRESENT CASE
5186-7793-0102 NEITHER EQUITY NOR COMPASSION OPERATE AGAINST IT A USEFUL A NECESSARY LAW IS BROKEN
5186-7793-0103 AND FACILITY I THEREFORE RETURN TO MY ORIGINAL POSITION THAT A LAW TO HAVE ITS EFFECT MUST BE PERMANENT AND STABLE IT MAY BE SAID IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE SCHOOLS
5186-7793-0104 WE MAY HAVE A LAW OR WE MAY HAVE NO LAW BUT WE CANNOT HAVE HALF A LAW WE MUST EITHER HAVE A RULE OF ACTION OR BE PERMITTED TO ACT BY DISCRETION AND BY CHANCE
5186-7793-0105 DEVIATIONS FROM THE LAW MUST BE UNIFORMLY PUNISHED OR NO MAN CAN BE CERTAIN WHEN HE SHALL BE SAFE THAT FROM THE RIGOUR OF THE ORIGINAL INSTITUTION THIS COURT
5186-7793-0106 HAS SOMETIMES DEPARTED CANNOT BE DENIED BUT AS IT IS EVIDENT THAT SUCH DEVIATIONS AS THEY MAKE LAW UNCERTAIN
5186-7793-0107 WITH SUCH COMPREHENSION OF MIND AND SUCH CLEARNESS OF PENETRATION DID HE THUS TREAT A SUBJECT ALTOGETHER NEW TO HIM WITHOUT ANY OTHER PREPARATION THAN MY
5186-7793-0108 ONE OF THAT HONOURABLE BODY HAD CRITICAL SAGACITY ENOUGH TO DISCOVER A MORE THAN ORDINARY HAND IN THE PETITION I TOLD HIM DOCTOR JOHNSON
5186-7793-0109 MY DEAR SIR GIVE YOURSELF NO TROUBLE IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE PAPERS YOU PRESENT TO US
5186-7793-0110 Q DEAR SIR THE REGRET HAS NOT BEEN LITTLE WITH WHICH I HAVE MISSED A JOURNEY SO PREGNANT WITH PLEASING EXPECTATIONS AS THAT IN WHICH I COULD PROMISE MYSELF NOT ONLY THE GRATIFICATION OF CURIOSITY BOTH RATIONAL AND FANCIFUL
5186-7793-0111 BUT SUCH HAS BEEN THE COURSE OF THINGS THAT I COULD NOT COME AND SUCH HAS BEEN I AM AFRAID THE STATE OF MY BODY THAT IT WOULD NOT WELL HAVE SECONDED MY INCLINATION MY BODY I THINK GROWS BETTER
5186-7793-0112 EVERY DAY MORE LIKED AT LEAST I LIKE IT MORE AS I LOOK MORE UPON IT I AM GLAD IF YOU GOT CREDIT BY YOUR CAUSE AND AM YET OF OPINION THAT OUR CAUSE WAS GOOD
5186-7793-0113 HAD BUT HIS DESERTS YOU PROMISED TO GET ME A LITTLE PINDAR
5186-7793-0114 THE LEISURE WHICH I CANNOT ENJOY IT WILL BE A PLEASURE TO HEAR THAT YOU EMPLOY UPON THE ANTIQUITIES OF THE FEUDAL ESTABLISHMENT THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF ANCIENT TENURES IS GRADUALLY PASSING AWAY
5186-7793-0115 WHO STUDIES THE LAWS OF HIS COUNTRY AND OF A GENTLEMAN WHO MAY NATURALLY BE CURIOUS TO KNOW THE CONDITION OF HIS OWN ANCESTORS I AM DEAR SIR YOURS WITH GREAT AFFECTION SAM JOHNSON
5186-7793-0116 MY DEAR SIR EDINBURGH DECEMBER TWENTY FIFTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO I WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU DID NOT COME TO SCOTLAND LAST AUTUMN HOWEVER I MUST OWN THAT YOUR LETTER PREVENTS ME FROM COMPLAINING
5186-7793-0117 WHICH WE HAVE SO LONG PROPOSED I COMMUNICATED TO BEATTIE WHAT YOU SAID OF HIS BOOK IN YOUR LAST LETTER TO ME HE WRITES TO ME THUS YOU JUDGE VERY RIGHTLY IN SUPPOSING
5186-7793-0118 THAT DOCTOR JOHNSON'S FAVOURABLE OPINION OF ANY BOOK MUST GIVE ME GREAT DELIGHT INDEED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY HOW MUCH I AM GRATIFIED BY IT
5606-54666-0000 EVERYTHING WAS OPPRESSIVELY NEW THE BRILLIANTLY VARNISHED DOOR CRACKED WITH A REPORT LIKE A PISTOL WHEN IT WAS OPENED THE PAPER ON THE WALLS WITH ITS GAUDY PATTERN OF BIRDS TRELLIS WORK AND FLOWERS IN GOLD RED AND GREEN ON A WHITE GROUND LOOKED HARDLY DRY YET
5606-54666-0001 THE SHOWY WINDOW CURTAINS OF WHITE AND SKY BLUE AND THE STILL SHOWIER CARPET OF RED AND YELLOW SEEMED AS IF THEY HAD COME OUT OF THE SHOP YESTERDAY THE ROUND ROSEWOOD TABLE WAS IN A PAINFULLY HIGH STATE OF POLISH THE MOROCCO BOUND PICTURE BOOKS THAT LAY ON IT
5606-54666-0002 NOT ONE LEAF EVEN OF THE MUSIC ON THE PIANO WAS DOGS EARED OR WORN NEVER WAS A RICHLY FURNISHED ROOM MORE THOROUGHLY COMFORTLESS THAN THIS THE EYE ACHED AT LOOKING ROUND IT THERE WAS NO REPOSE ANYWHERE
5606-54666-0003 THE PRINT OF THE QUEEN HANGING LONELY ON THE WALL IN ITS HEAVY GILT FRAME WITH A LARGE CROWN AT THE TOP GLARED ON YOU THE PAPER THE CURTAINS THE CARPET GLARED ON YOU THE BOOKS THE WAX FLOWERS IN GLASS CASES
5606-54666-0004 ALL SURROUNDING OBJECTS SEEMED STARTLINGLY NEAR TO THE EYE MUCH NEARER THAN THEY REALLY WERE
5606-54666-0005 BEFORE HE HAD BEEN IN IT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR I WAS NOT KEPT WAITING LONG ANOTHER VIOLENT CRACK FROM THE NEW DOOR ANNOUNCED THE ENTRANCE OF MISTER SHERWIN HIMSELF HE WAS A TALL THIN MAN RATHER ROUND SHOULDERED
5606-54666-0006 WEAK AT THE KNEES AND TRYING TO CONCEAL THE WEAKNESS IN THE BREADTH OF HIS TROWSERS HE WORE A WHITE CRAVAT AND AN ABSURDLY HIGH SHIRT COLLAR HIS COMPLEXION WAS SALLOW HIS EYES WERE SMALL BLACK BRIGHT AND INCESSANTLY IN MOTION
5606-54666-0007 THE MOUTH AND THE MUSCLES OF THE CHEEK HIS HAIR HAD BEEN BLACK BUT WAS NOW TURNING TO A SORT OF IRON GREY
5606-54666-0008 AND PART OF IT PROJECTED ALMOST HORIZONTALLY OVER HIS FOREHEAD HE HAD A HABIT OF STRETCHING IT IN THIS DIRECTION BY IRRITABLY COMBING IT OUT FROM TIME TO TIME WITH HIS FINGERS HIS LIPS WERE THIN AND COLOURLESS
5606-54666-0009 A GREAT STICKLER FOR THE CONVENTIONAL RESPECTABILITIES OF LIFE AND A GREAT BELIEVER IN HIS OWN INFALLIBILITY BUT HE WAS MARGARET'S FATHER AND I WAS DETERMINED TO BE PLEASED WITH HIM HE MADE ME A LOW AND RATHER A CRINGING BOW
5606-54666-0010 THEN LOOKED TO THE WINDOW AND SEEING THE CARRIAGE WAITING FOR ME AT HIS DOOR MADE ANOTHER BOW AND INSISTED ON RELIEVING ME OF MY HAT WITH HIS OWN HAND THIS DONE HE COUGHED AND BEGGED TO KNOW WHAT HE COULD DO FOR ME
5606-54666-0011 I FELT SOME DIFFICULTY IN OPENING MY BUSINESS TO HIM IT WAS NECESSARY TO SPEAK HOWEVER AT ONCE I BEGAN WITH AN APOLOGY I AM AFRAID MISTER SHERWIN THAT THIS INTRUSION ON THE PART OF A PERFECT STRANGER
5606-54666-0012 NOT ENTIRELY A STRANGER SIR IF I MAY BE ALLOWED TO SAY SO INDEED I HAD THE GREAT PLEASURE SIR AND PROFIT AND
5606-54666-0013 VERY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE I HAPPEN TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE STEWARD OF YOUR RESPECTED FATHER HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME TO WALK THROUGH THE ROOMS A TREAT QUITE AN INTELLECTUAL TREAT THE FURNITURE AND HANGINGS AND SO ON ARRANGED IN SUCH A CHASTE STYLE AND
5606-54666-0014 THE PICTURES SOME OF THE FINEST PIECES I EVER SAW I WAS DELIGHTED QUITE DELIGHTED INDEED HE SPOKE IN UNDER TONES LAYING GREAT STRESS UPON PARTICULAR WORDS THAT WERE EVIDENTLY FAVOURITES WITH HIM SUCH AS INDEED
5606-54666-0015 NOT ONLY HIS EYES BUT HIS WHOLE FACE SEEMED TO BE NERVOUSLY BLINKING AND WINKING ALL THE TIME HE WAS ADDRESSING ME IN THE EMBARRASSMENT AND ANXIETY WHICH I THEN FELT THIS PECULIARITY FIDGETTED AND BEWILDERED ME MORE THAN I CAN DESCRIBE
5606-54666-0016 I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE WORLD TO HAVE HAD HIS BACK TURNED BEFORE I SPOKE TO HIM AGAIN I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT MY FAMILY AND MY NAME ARE NOT UNKNOWN TO YOU MISTER SHERWIN I RESUMED
5606-54666-0017 UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I SHALL FEEL LESS HESITATION AND DIFFICULTY IN MAKING YOU ACQUAINTED WITH THE OBJECT OF MY VISIT
5606-54666-0018 THANK YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE MISTER SHERWIN I HAVE REASONS FOR WISHING THAT THIS INTERVIEW
5606-54666-0019 MAY BE CONSIDERED STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL I AM SURE I CAN DEPEND ON YOUR FAVOURING ME THUS FAR CERTAINLY MOST CERTAINLY THE STRICTEST SECRECY OF COURSE PRAY GO ON HE DREW HIS CHAIR A LITTLE NEARER TO ME
5606-54666-0020 I MUST ALSO BEG YOU TO SUSPEND YOUR JUDGMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE HEARD ME TO THE END YOU MAY BE DISPOSED TO VIEW TO VIEW
5606-54666-0021 HE STOPPED HALF BREATHLESS BENDING FORWARD TOWARDS ME AND CRUMPLING MY CARD BETWEEN HIS FINGERS INTO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE DIMENSIONS
5606-54666-0022 RATHER MORE THAN A WEEK AGO I CONTINUED I ACCIDENTALLY MET MISS SHERWIN IN AN OMNIBUS ACCOMPANIED BY A LADY OLDER THAN HERSELF MY WIFE MISSUS SHERWIN HE SAID IMPATIENTLY MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND
5606-54666-0023 AS IF MISSUS SHERWIN WERE SOME INSIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE TO THE CONVERSATION WHICH HE WISHED TO CLEAR OUT OF THE WAY AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
5606-54666-0024 THE IMPRESSION SHE MADE ON ME WAS SOMETHING MORE HOWEVER THAN A MERE MOMENTARY FEELING OF ADMIRATION
5606-54666-0025 YOU HAVE HEARD OF SUCH A THING AS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT MISTER SHERWIN IN BOOKS SIR HE TAPPED ONE OF THE MOROCCO BOUND VOLUMES ON THE TABLE AND SMILED A CURIOUS SMILE PARTLY DEFERENTIAL AND PARTLY SARCASTIC
5606-54666-0026 YOU WOULD BE INCLINED TO LAUGH I DARE SAY IF I ASKED YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT OUT OF BOOKS BUT WITHOUT DWELLING FURTHER ON THAT IT IS MY DUTY TO CONFESS TO YOU
5606-54666-0027 IN ALL CANDOUR AND HONESTY THAT THE IMPRESSION MISS SHERWIN PRODUCED ON ME WAS SUCH AS TO MAKE ME DESIRE THE PRIVILEGE OF BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH HER IN PLAIN WORDS I DISCOVERED HER PLACE OF RESIDENCE BY FOLLOWING HER TO THIS HOUSE
5606-54666-0028 UPON MY SOUL THIS IS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY PROCEEDING PRAY HEAR ME OUT MISTER SHERWIN YOU WILL NOT CONDEMN MY CONDUCT I THINK IF YOU HEAR ALL I HAVE TO SAY HE MUTTERED SOMETHING UNINTELLIGIBLE
5606-54666-0029 HIS COMPLEXION TURNED YELLOWER HE DROPPED MY CARD WHICH HE HAD BY THIS TIME CRUSHED INTO FRAGMENTS AND RAN HIS HAND RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS HAIR UNTIL HE HAD STRETCHED IT OUT LIKE A PENTHOUSE OVER HIS FOREHEAD BLINKING ALL THE TIME AND REGARDING ME
5606-54666-0030 WITH A LOWERING SINISTER EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE I SAW THAT IT WAS USELESS TO TREAT HIM AS I SHOULD HAVE TREATED A GENTLEMAN HE HAD EVIDENTLY PUT THE MEANEST AND THE FOULEST CONSTRUCTION UPON MY DELICACY AND HESITATION IN SPEAKING TO HIM SO I ALTERED MY PLAN
5606-54666-0031 AND CAME TO THE POINT ABRUPTLY CAME TO BUSINESS AS HE WOULD HAVE CALLED IT I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN PLAINER MISTER SHERWIN I OUGHT PERHAPS TO HAVE TOLD YOU AT THE OUTSET IN SO MANY WORDS THAT I CAME TO
5606-54666-0032 I WAS ABOUT TO SAY TO ASK YOUR DAUGHTER'S HAND IN MARRIAGE BUT A THOUGHT OF MY FATHER MOVED DARKLY OVER MY MIND AT THAT MOMENT AND THE WORDS WOULD NOT PASS MY LIPS WELL SIR TO WHAT THE TONE IN WHICH HE SAID THIS WAS HARSH ENOUGH TO ROUSE ME
5606-54666-0033 IT GAVE ME BACK MY SELF POSSESSION IMMEDIATELY TO ASK YOUR PERMISSION TO PAY MY ADDRESSES TO MISS SHERWIN OR TO BE PLAINER STILL IF YOU LIKE TO ASK OF YOU HER HAND IN MARRIAGE THE WORDS WERE SPOKEN
5606-54666-0034 EVEN IF I COULD HAVE DONE SO I WOULD NOT HAVE RECALLED WHAT I HAD JUST SAID BUT STILL I TREMBLED IN SPITE OF MYSELF AS I EXPRESSED IN PLAIN BLUNT WORDS WHAT I HAD ONLY RAPTUROUSLY THOUGHT OVER OR DELICATELY HINTED AT TO MARGARET UP TO THIS TIME
5606-54666-0035 HIGHLY INDEED MY DEAR SIR DON'T SUPPOSE FOR ONE MOMENT I EVER DOUBTED YOUR HONOURABLE FEELING
5606-54666-0036 IN SHORT OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN THEIR RANK EXACTLY BUT THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION QUITE A MISUNDERSTANDING EXTREMELY STUPID OF ME TO BE SURE PRAY LET ME OFFER YOU A GLASS OF WINE
5606-54666-0037 IN CONFIDENCE HOW I AM SITUATED WITH REGARD TO THE PROPOSALS I HAVE MADE THERE ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES YES YES HE BENT FORWARD AGAIN EAGERLY TOWARDS ME AS HE SPOKE
5606-54666-0038 LOOKING MORE INQUISITIVE AND MORE CUNNING THAN EVER I HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED TO YOU MISTER SHERWIN THAT I HAVE FOUND MEANS TO SPEAK TO YOUR DAUGHTER
5606-54666-0039 NOW ALTHOUGH IN SO MANY WORDS SHE DIRECTLY DISCOURAGED ME IT IS HER DUE THAT I SHOULD SAY THIS STILL I THINK I MAY WITHOUT VANITY VENTURE TO HOPE THAT SHE DID SO AS A MATTER OF DUTY MORE THAN AS A MATTER OF INCLINATION
5606-54666-0040 NO DOUBT THAT WAS ONE REASON WHY SHE RECEIVED ME AS SHE DID BUT SHE HAD ANOTHER WHICH SHE COMMUNICATED TO ME IN THE PLAINEST TERMS THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR RANK OF LIFE
5606-54666-0041 YES YES HIGH PRINCIPLES SIR HIGH PRINCIPLES THANK GOD
5606-54666-0042 SHE MADE NO OBJECTION AND I AM THEREFORE I THINK JUSTIFIED IN CONSIDERING THAT IF YOU AUTHORISED THE REMOVAL OF SCRUPLES WHICH DO HER HONOUR AT PRESENT SHE WOULD NOT FEEL THE DELICACY SHE DOES NOW AT SANCTIONING MY ADDRESSES
5606-54666-0043 VERY PROPER A VERY PROPER WAY OF PUTTING IT PRACTICAL IF I MAY BE ALLOWED TO SAY SO
5606-54666-0044 IT IS EXACTLY THERE THAT THE DIFFICULTY LIES MY FATHER ON WHOM I AM DEPENDENT AS THE YOUNGER SON HAS VERY STRONG PREJUDICES CONVICTIONS I OUGHT PERHAPS TO CALL THEM ON THE SUBJECT OF SOCIAL INEQUALITIES QUITE SO MOST NATURAL
5606-54666-0045 MOST BECOMING INDEED ON THE PART OF YOUR RESPECTED FATHER I HONOUR HIS CONVICTIONS SIR SUCH ESTATES SUCH HOUSES SUCH A FAMILY AS HIS CONNECTED I BELIEVE WITH THE NOBILITY ESPECIALLY ON YOUR LATE LAMENTED MOTHER'S SIDE
5606-54666-0046 MY DEAR SIR I EMPHATICALLY REPEAT IT YOUR FATHER'S CONVICTIONS DO HIM HONOUR I RESPECT THEM AS MUCH AS I RESPECT HIM I DO INDEED I AM GLAD YOU CAN VIEW MY FATHER'S IDEAS ON SOCIAL SUBJECTS IN SO FAVOURABLE A LIGHT MISTER SHERWIN
5606-54666-0047 YOU WILL BE LESS SURPRISED TO HEAR HOW THEY ARE LIKELY TO AFFECT ME IN THE STEP I AM NOW TAKING HE DISAPPROVES OF IT OF COURSE STRONGLY PERHAPS
5606-54666-0048 HE RAN HIS FINGERS RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS HAIR AND TRIED TO LOOK INDEPENDENT STILL I AM PREPARED TO ADMIT UNDER ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES I SAY UNDER ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HIS DISAPPROVAL IS VERY NATURAL
5606-54666-0050 MY MEETING WITH YOUR DAUGHTER HAS BEEN KEPT A PROFOUND SECRET FROM HIM AND FROM EVERY MEMBER OF MY FAMILY AND A SECRET IT MUST REMAIN I SPEAK FROM MY INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF MY FATHER WHEN I SAY THAT I HARDLY KNOW OF ANY MEANS THAT HE WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF EMPLOYING
5606-54666-0051 TO FRUSTRATE THE PURPOSE OF THIS VISIT IF I HAD MENTIONED IT TO HIM HE HAS BEEN THE KINDEST AND BEST OF FATHERS TO ME BUT I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IF I WAITED FOR HIS CONSENT
5606-54666-0052 NO ENTREATIES OF MINE OR OF ANY ONE BELONGING TO ME WOULD INDUCE HIM TO GIVE HIS SANCTION TO THE MARRIAGE I HAVE COME TO YOU TO PROPOSE BLESS MY SOUL THIS IS CARRYING THINGS RATHER FAR THOUGH
5606-54666-0053 WE MUST KEEP BOTH THE COURTSHIP AND THE MARRIAGE SECRET SECRET GOOD GRACIOUS I DON'T AT ALL SEE MY WAY YES SECRET
5606-54666-0054 A PROFOUND SECRET AMONG OURSELVES UNTIL I CAN DIVULGE MY MARRIAGE TO MY FATHER WITH THE BEST CHANCE OF BUT I TELL YOU SIR I CAN'T SEE MY WAY THROUGH IT AT ALL CHANCE WHAT CHANCE WOULD THERE BE AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME
5606-54666-0055 THERE MIGHT BE MANY CHANCES FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE MARRIAGE WAS SOLEMNISED I MIGHT INTRODUCE YOUR DAUGHTER TO MY FATHER'S NOTICE WITHOUT DISCLOSING WHO SHE WAS AND LEAVE HER GRADUALLY AND UNSUSPECTEDLY
5606-54666-0056 TO WIN HIS AFFECTION AND RESPECT AS WITH HER BEAUTY ELEGANCE AND AMIABILITY SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO DO WHILE I WAITED UNTIL THE OCCASION WAS RIPE FOR CONFESSING EVERYTHING THEN IF I SAID TO HIM
5606-54666-0057 IF ON THE OTHER HAND I COULD ONLY SAY THIS YOUNG LADY IS ABOUT TO BECOME MY WIFE HIS PREJUDICES WOULD ASSUREDLY INDUCE HIM TO RECALL HIS MOST FAVOURABLE IMPRESSIONS AND REFUSE HIS CONSENT IN SHORT MISTER SHERWIN BEFORE MARRIAGE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE HIM
5606-54666-0058 AFTER MARRIAGE WHEN OPPOSITION COULD NO LONGER BE OF ANY AVAIL IT WOULD BE QUITE A DIFFERENT THING WE MIGHT BE SURE OF PRODUCING SOONER OR LATER THE MOST FAVOURABLE RESULTS
5606-54666-0059 THIS IS WHY IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO KEEP OUR UNION SECRET AT FIRST I WONDERED THEN I HAVE SINCE WONDERED MORE HOW IT WAS THAT I CONTRIVED TO SPEAK THUS
5606-54666-0060 RATTLING A BUNCH OF KEYS IN HIS POCKET WITH AN EXPRESSION OF CONSIDERABLE PERPLEXITY
5606-54666-0061 TO HAVE A GENTLEMAN OF YOUR BIRTH AND BREEDING FOR A SON IN LAW IS OF COURSE BUT THEN THERE IS THE MONEY QUESTION SUPPOSE YOU FAILED WITH YOUR FATHER AFTER ALL MY MONEY IS OUT IN MY SPECULATIONS I CAN DO NOTHING
5606-54666-0062 I HAVE INFLUENTIAL FRIENDS MISTER SHERWIN IN MANY DIRECTIONS THERE ARE APPOINTMENTS GOOD APPOINTMENTS WHICH WOULD BE OPEN TO ME IF I PUSHED MY INTERESTS I MIGHT PROVIDE IN THIS WAY AGAINST THE CHANCE OF FAILURE
5606-54666-0063 I CAN ONLY ASSURE YOU THAT MY ATTACHMENT TO MISS SHERWIN IS NOT OF A NATURE TO BE OVERCOME BY ANY PECUNIARY CONSIDERATIONS I SPEAK IN ALL OUR INTERESTS WHEN I SAY
5606-54666-0064 THAT A PRIVATE MARRIAGE GIVES US A CHANCE FOR THE FUTURE AS OPPORTUNITIES ARISE OF GRADUALLY DISCLOSING IT MY OFFER TO YOU MAY BE MADE UNDER SOME DISADVANTAGES AND DIFFICULTIES PERHAPS
5606-54666-0065 FOR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A VERY SMALL INDEPENDENCE LEFT ME BY MY MOTHER I HAVE NO CERTAIN PROSPECTS BUT I REALLY THINK MY PROPOSALS HAVE SOME COMPENSATING ADVANTAGES TO RECOMMEND THEM CERTAINLY
5606-54666-0066 MOST DECIDEDLY SO I AM NOT INSENSIBLE MY DEAR SIR TO THE GREAT ADVANTAGE AND HONOUR AND SO FORTH BUT THERE IS SOMETHING SO UNUSUAL ABOUT THE WHOLE AFFAIR
5606-54666-0067 THAT COULD HARDLY HAPPEN I THINK WITH HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND EDUCATION AND MANNERS TOO SO DISTINGUISHED THOUGH PERHAPS I OUGHT NOT TO SAY SO
5606-54666-0068 I AM SURE MISTER SHERWIN A SCHOOL SIR WHERE IT WAS A RULE TO TAKE IN NO THING LOWER THAN THE DAUGHTER OF A PROFESSIONAL MAN THEY ONLY WAIVED THE RULE IN MY CASE THE MOST GENTEEL SCHOOL PERHAPS IN ALL LONDON A DRAWING ROOM DEPORTMENT DAY ONCE EVERY WEEK
5606-54666-0069 TO PRACTISE THE GIRLS WITH THE FOOTMAN OF THE ESTABLISHMENT IN ATTENDANCE IN GETTING INTO A CARRIAGE AND GETTING OUT AGAIN IN A LADY LIKE MANNER NO DUCHESS HAS HAD A BETTER EDUCATION THAN MY MARGARET PERMIT ME TO ASSURE YOU MISTER SHERWIN AND THEN HER KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGES
5606-54666-0070 HER FRENCH AND ITALIAN AND GERMAN NOT DISCONTINUED IN HOLIDAYS OR AFTER SHE LEFT SCHOOL SHE HAS ONLY JUST LEFT IT
5606-54666-0071 MAY I ASK WHO MISTER MANNION IS THE TONE IN WHICH I PUT THIS QUESTION COOLED HIS ENTHUSIASM ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER'S EDUCATION IMMEDIATELY HE ANSWERED IN HIS FORMER TONES AND WITH ONE OF HIS FORMER BOWS
5606-54666-0072 MISTER MANNION IS MY CONFIDENTIAL CLERK SIR
5606-54666-0073 IS HE A YOUNG MAN YOUNG OH DEAR NO MISTER MANNION IS FORTY OR A YEAR OR TWO MORE IF HE'S A DAY AN ADMIRABLE MAN OF BUSINESS AS WELL AS A GREAT SCHOLAR
5606-54666-0074 I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT I THINK WE ARE WANDERING AWAY FROM THE POINT A LITTLE I BEG YOURS SO WE ARE WELL MY DEAR SIR I MUST BE ALLOWED A DAY OR TWO SAY TWO DAYS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT MY DAUGHTER'S FEELINGS ARE
5606-54666-0075 AND TO CONSIDER YOUR PROPOSALS WHICH HAVE TAKEN ME VERY MUCH BY SURPRISE AS YOU MAY IN FACT SEE BUT I ASSURE YOU I AM MOST FLATTERED MOST HONOURED MOST ANXIOUS I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER MY ANXIETIES MISTER SHERWIN
5606-54666-0076 AND BETWEEN THAT TIME AND THIS YOU WILL ENGAGE NOT TO HOLD ANY COMMUNICATION WITH MY DAUGHTER I PROMISE NOT MISTER SHERWIN BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT YOUR ANSWER WILL BE FAVOURABLE
5606-54666-0077 A LITTLE CONSIDERATION AND A LITTLE TALK WITH MY DEAR GIRL
5606-54666-0078 NO AGAIN VERY WELL THEN THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW AT FIVE O'CLOCK WITH A LOUDER CRACK THAN EVER THE BRAND NEW DRAWING ROOM DOOR WAS OPENED TO LET ME OUT THE NOISE WAS INSTANTLY SUCCEEDED BY THE RUSTLING OF A SILK DRESS AND THE BANGING OF ANOTHER DOOR AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE PASSAGE
5606-54667-0000 AND INQUIRED WHETHER HE SHOULD TELL HER THAT I HAD COME IN I DESIRED HIM NOT TO DISTURB HER AS IT WAS MY INTENTION TO GO OUT AGAIN IMMEDIATELY I WENT INTO MY STUDY AND WROTE A SHORT NOTE THERE TO CLARA MERELY TELLING HER THAT I SHOULD BE ABSENT IN THE COUNTRY FOR TWO DAYS
5606-54667-0001 AND WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHEN I HEARD THE LIBRARY DOOR OPEN I INSTANTLY DREW BACK AND HALF CLOSED MY OWN DOOR AGAIN CLARA HAD GOT THE BOOK SHE WANTED AND WAS TAKING IT UP TO HER OWN SITTING ROOM
5606-54667-0002 I WAITED TILL SHE WAS OUT OF SIGHT AND THEN LEFT THE HOUSE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER AVOIDED MY SISTER MY SISTER WHO HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE ASKED A QUESTION OR UTTERED A WORD THAT COULD ANNOY ME MY SISTER WHO HAD CONFIDED
5606-54667-0003 AS I THOUGHT ON WHAT I HAD DONE I FELT A SENSE OF HUMILIATION WHICH WAS ALMOST PUNISHMENT ENOUGH FOR THE MEANNESS OF WHICH I HAD BEEN GUILTY I WENT ROUND TO THE STABLES AND HAD MY HORSE SADDLED IMMEDIATELY
5606-54667-0004 NO IDEA OF PROCEEDING IN ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION OCCURRED TO ME I SIMPLY FELT RESOLVED TO PASS MY TWO DAYS ORDEAL OF SUSPENSE AWAY FROM HOME FAR ENOUGH AWAY TO KEEP ME FAITHFUL TO MY PROMISE NOT TO SEE MARGARET SOON AFTER I STARTED
5606-54667-0005 I LEFT MY HORSE TO HIS OWN GUIDANCE AND GAVE MYSELF UP TO MY THOUGHTS AND RECOLLECTIONS AS ONE BY ONE THEY ROSE WITHIN ME THE ANIMAL TOOK THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD BEEN OFTENEST USED TO TAKE DURING MY RESIDENCE IN LONDON THE NORTHERN ROAD
5606-54667-0006 IT WAS NOT UNTIL I HAD RIDDEN HALF A MILE BEYOND THE SUBURBS THAT I LOOKED ROUND ME AND DISCOVERED TOWARDS WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY I WAS PROCEEDING I DREW THE REIN DIRECTLY AND TURNED MY HORSE'S HEAD BACK AGAIN
5606-54667-0007 TO FOLLOW THE FAVOURITE ROAD WHICH I HAD SO OFTEN FOLLOWED WITH CLARA TO STOP PERHAPS AT SOME PLACE WHERE I HAD OFTEN STOPPED WITH HER WAS MORE THAN I HAD THE COURAGE OR THE INSENSIBILITY TO DO AT THAT MOMENT
5606-54667-0008 I RODE AS FAR AS EWELL AND STOPPED THERE THE DARKNESS HAD OVERTAKEN ME AND IT WAS USELESS TO TIRE MY HORSE BY GOING ON ANY GREATER DISTANCE THE NEXT MORNING I WAS UP ALMOST WITH SUNRISE AND PASSED THE GREATER PART OF THE DAY IN WALKING ABOUT AMONG VILLAGES LANES AND FIELDS
5606-54667-0009 JUST AS CHANCE LED ME DURING THE NIGHT MANY THOUGHTS THAT I HAD BANISHED FOR THE LAST WEEK HAD RETURNED THOSE THOUGHTS OF EVIL OMEN UNDER WHICH THE MIND SEEMS TO ACHE JUST AS THE BODY ACHES UNDER A DULL HEAVY PAIN
5606-54667-0010 TO WHICH WE CAN ASSIGN NO PARTICULAR PLACE OR CAUSE ABSENT FROM MARGARET I HAD NO RESOURCE AGAINST THE OPPRESSION THAT NOW OVERCAME ME I COULD ONLY ENDEAVOUR TO ALLEVIATE IT BY KEEPING INCESSANTLY IN ACTION BY WALKING OR RIDING
5606-54667-0011 BESIDES WHAT I HAD OBSERVED OF MARGARET'S FATHER ESPECIALLY DURING THE LATTER PART OF MY INTERVIEW WITH HIM SHOWED ME PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT HE WAS TRYING TO CONCEAL UNDER EXAGGERATED SURPRISE AND ASSUMED HESITATION HIS SECRET DESIRE TO PROFIT AT ONCE BY MY OFFER
5606-54667-0012 WHICH WHATEVER CONDITIONS MIGHT CLOG IT WAS INFINITELY MORE ADVANTAGEOUS IN A SOCIAL POINT OF VIEW THAN ANY HE COULD HAVE HOPED FOR IT WAS NOT HIS DELAY IN ACCEPTING MY PROPOSALS BUT THE BURDEN OF DECEIT
5606-54667-0013 THE FETTERS OF CONCEALMENT FORCED ON ME BY THE PROPOSALS THEMSELVES WHICH NOW HUNG HEAVY ON MY HEART THAT EVENING I LEFT EWELL AND RODE TOWARDS HOME AGAIN AS FAR AS RICHMOND WHERE I REMAINED FOR THE NIGHT AND THE FOREPART OF THE NEXT DAY
5606-54667-0014 I REACHED LONDON IN THE AFTERNOON AND GOT TO NORTH VILLA WITHOUT GOING HOME FIRST ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK THE OPPRESSION WAS STILL ON MY SPIRITS EVEN THE SIGHT OF THE HOUSE WHERE MARGARET LIVED FAILED TO INVIGORATE OR AROUSE ME
5606-54667-0015 ON THIS OCCASION WHEN I WAS SHOWN INTO THE DRAWING ROOM BOTH MISTER AND MISSUS SHERWIN WERE AWAITING ME THERE ON THE TABLE WAS THE SHERRY WHICH HAD BEEN SO PERSEVERINGLY PRESSED ON ME AT THE LAST INTERVIEW AND BY IT A NEW POUND CAKE
5606-54667-0016 MISSUS SHERWIN WAS CUTTING THE CAKE AS I CAME IN WHILE HER HUSBAND WATCHED THE PROCESS WITH CRITICAL EYES THE POOR WOMAN'S WEAK WHITE FINGERS TREMBLED AS THEY MOVED THE KNIFE UNDER CONJUGAL INSPECTION
5606-54667-0017 MOST HAPPY TO SEE YOU AGAIN MOST HAPPY INDEED MY DEAR SIR SAID MISTER SHERWIN ADVANCING WITH HOSPITABLE SMILE AND OUTSTRETCHED HAND ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MY BETTER HALF MISSUS S HIS WIFE ROSE IN A HURRY AND CURTSEYED
5606-54667-0018 LEAVING THE KNIFE STICKING IN THE CAKE UPON WHICH MISTER SHERWIN WITH A STERN LOOK AT HER OSTENTATIOUSLY PULLED IT OUT AND SET IT DOWN RATHER VIOLENTLY ON THE DISH POOR MISSUS SHERWIN
5606-54667-0019 I HAD HARDLY NOTICED HER ON THE DAY WHEN SHE GOT INTO THE OMNIBUS WITH HER DAUGHTER IT WAS AS IF I NOW SAW HER FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE IS A NATURAL COMMUNICATIVENESS ABOUT WOMEN'S EMOTIONS A HAPPY WOMAN
5606-54667-0020 IMPERCEPTIBLY DIFFUSES HER HAPPINESS AROUND HER SHE HAS AN INFLUENCE THAT IS SOMETHING AKIN TO THE INFLUENCE OF A SUNSHINY DAY SO AGAIN THE MELANCHOLY OF A MELANCHOLY WOMAN IS INVARIABLY THOUGH SILENTLY INFECTIOUS
5606-54667-0021 AND MISSUS SHERWIN WAS ONE OF THIS LATTER ORDER HER PALE SICKLY MOIST LOOKING SKIN HER LARGE MILD WATERY LIGHT BLUE EYES THE RESTLESS TIMIDITY OF HER EXPRESSION
5606-54667-0022 THE MIXTURE OF USELESS HESITATION AND INVOLUNTARY RAPIDITY IN EVERY ONE OF HER ACTIONS ALL FURNISHED THE SAME SIGNIFICANT BETRAYAL OF A LIFE OF INCESSANT FEAR AND RESTRAINT
5606-54667-0023 OF A DISPOSITION FULL OF MODEST GENEROSITIES AND MEEK SYMPATHIES WHICH HAD BEEN CRUSHED DOWN PAST ROUSING TO SELF ASSERTION PAST EVER SEEING THE LIGHT THERE IN THAT MILD WAN FACE OF HERS
5606-54667-0024 IN THOSE PAINFUL STARTINGS AND HURRYINGS WHEN SHE MOVED IN THAT TREMULOUS FAINT UTTERANCE WHEN SHE SPOKE THERE I COULD SEE ONE OF THOSE GHASTLY HEART TRAGEDIES LAID OPEN BEFORE ME WHICH ARE ACTED AND RE ACTED SCENE BY SCENE
5606-54667-0025 IN THE SECRET THEATRE OF HOME TRAGEDIES WHICH ARE EVER SHADOWED BY THE SLOW FALLING OF THE BLACK CURTAIN THAT DROPS LOWER AND LOWER EVERY DAY THAT DROPS TO HIDE ALL AT LAST FROM THE HAND OF DEATH
5606-54667-0026 SAID MISSUS SHERWIN ALMOST INAUDIBLY LOOKING AS SHE SPOKE WITH ANXIOUS EYES TOWARDS HER HUSBAND TO SEE IF SHE WAS JUSTIFIED IN UTTERING EVEN THOSE PITEOUSLY COMMON PLACE WORDS VERY BEAUTIFUL WEATHER TO BE SURE CONTINUED THE POOR WOMAN
5606-54667-0027 AND HAD BEEN ORDERED TO SAY HER FIRST LESSON IN A STRANGER'S PRESENCE DELIGHTFUL WEATHER MISSUS SHERWIN I HAVE BEEN ENJOYING IT FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS IN THE COUNTRY IN A PART OF SURREY THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF EWELL THAT I HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE THERE WAS A PAUSE
5606-54667-0028 MISTER SHERWIN COUGHED IT WAS EVIDENTLY A WARNING MATRIMONIAL PEAL THAT HE HAD OFTEN RUNG BEFORE FOR MISSUS SHERWIN STARTED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM DIRECTLY
5606-54667-0029 AS THE LADY OF THE HOUSE MISSUS S IT STRIKES ME THAT YOU MIGHT OFFER A VISITOR LIKE THIS GENTLEMAN SOME CAKE AND WINE WITHOUT MAKING ANY PARTICULAR HOLE IN YOUR MANNERS
5606-54667-0030 THAT THE DECANTER TINKLED ALL THE WHILE AGAINST THE GLASS THOUGH I WANTED NOTHING I ATE AND DRANK SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY IN COMMON CONSIDERATION FOR MISSUS SHERWIN'S EMBARRASSMENT MISTER SHERWIN FILLED HIMSELF A GLASS HELD IT UP ADMIRINGLY TO THE LIGHT
5606-54667-0031 SAID YOUR GOOD HEALTH SIR YOUR VERY GOOD HEALTH
5606-54667-0032 HIS WIFE TO WHOM HE OFFERED NOTHING LOOKED AT HIM ALL THE TIME WITH THE MOST REVERENTIAL ATTENTION YOU ARE TAKING NOTHING YOURSELF MISSUS SHERWIN I SAID
5606-54667-0033 THIS SHERRY STANDS ME IN SIX SHILLINGS A BOTTLE OUGHT TO BE FIRST RATE WINE AT THAT PRICE AND SO IT IS WELL IF YOU WON'T HAVE ANY MORE WE WILL PROCEED TO BUSINESS HA HA BUSINESS AS I CALL IT
5606-54667-0034 MISSUS SHERWIN COUGHED A VERY WEAK SMALL COUGH HALF STIFLED IN ITS BIRTH
5606-54667-0035 WELL SIR THE EVENING AFTER YOU LEFT ME I HAD WHAT YOU MAY CALL AN EXPLANATION WITH MY DEAR GIRL
5606-54667-0036 HERE MISSUS SHERWIN PUT HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER EYES QUITE NOISELESSLY FOR SHE HAD DOUBTLESS ACQUIRED BY LONG PRACTICE THE HABIT OF WEEPING IN SILENCE HER HUSBAND'S QUICK GLANCE TURNED ON HER HOWEVER IMMEDIATELY
5606-54667-0037 HE SAID INDIGNANTLY WHAT IS THERE TO CRY ABOUT
5606-54667-0038 THIS IS A MOST ANNOYING CIRCUMSTANCE AND BEFORE A VISITOR TOO YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME TO DISCUSS THE MATTER ALONE YOU ALWAYS WERE IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS AND IT'S MY OPINION YOU ALWAYS WILL BE MISSUS SHERWIN PREPARED WITHOUT A WORD OF REMONSTRANCE TO LEAVE THE ROOM
5606-54667-0039 I SINCERELY FELT FOR HER BUT COULD SAY NOTHING IN THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT I ROSE TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR HER AND IMMEDIATELY REPENTED HAVING DONE SO THE ACTION ADDED SO MUCH TO HER EMBARRASSMENT THAT SHE KICKED HER FOOT AGAINST A CHAIR
5606-54667-0040 MISTER SHERWIN HELPED HIMSELF TO A SECOND GLASS OF WINE WITHOUT TAKING THE SMALLEST NOTICE OF THIS I HOPE MISSUS SHERWIN HAS NOT HURT HERSELF I SAID OH DEAR NO NOT WORTH A MOMENT'S THOUGHT AWKWARDNESS AND NERVOUSNESS NOTHING ELSE SHE ALWAYS WAS NERVOUS THE DOCTORS ALL HUMBUGS
5606-54667-0041 CAN DO NOTHING WITH HER IT'S VERY SAD VERY SAD INDEED BUT THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT BY THIS TIME IN SPITE OF ALL MY EFFORTS TO PRESERVE SOME RESPECT FOR HIM AS MARGARET'S FATHER HE HAD SUNK TO HIS PROPER PLACE IN MY ESTIMATION WELL MY DEAR SIR HE RESUMED
5618-48830-0000 AND I HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THAT A CERTAIN BULLOCK EXHIBITED BY LORD DE GUEST WAS DECLARED BY THE METROPOLITAN BUTCHERS TO HAVE REALIZED ALL THE POSSIBLE EXCELLENCES OF BREEDING FEEDING AND CONDITION
5618-48830-0001 BUT LORD DE GUEST TOOK THE PRAISE THAT WAS OFFERED TO HIM AND FOUND HIMSELF IN A SEVENTH HEAVEN OF DELIGHT HE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN SURROUNDED BY BUTCHERS GRAZIERS AND SALESMEN WHO WERE ABLE TO APPRECIATE THE WORK OF HIS LIFE
5618-48830-0002 ISN'T HE LIKE HIS SIRE HE WAS GOT BY LAMBKIN YOU KNOW LAMBKIN SAID JOHNNY WHO HAD NOT AS YET BEEN ABLE TO LEARN MUCH ABOUT THE GUESTWICK STOCK YES LAMBKIN THE BULL THAT WE HAD THE TROUBLE WITH
5618-48830-0003 I DARESAY SAID JOHNNY WHO LOOKED VERY HARD BUT COULD NOT SEE IT'S VERY ODD EXCLAIMED THE EARL BUT DO YOU KNOW THAT BULL HAS BEEN AS QUIET SINCE THAT DAY AS QUIET AS AS ANYTHING
5618-48830-0004 I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN MY POCKET HANDKERCHIEF I DARESAY IT WAS SAID JOHNNY OR PERHAPS THE FLIES FLIES SAID THE EARL ANGRILY DO YOU SUPPOSE HE ISN'T USED TO FLIES COME AWAY I ORDERED DINNER AT SEVEN AND IT'S PAST SIX NOW
5618-48830-0005 MY BROTHER IN LAW COLONEL DALE IS UP IN TOWN AND HE DINES WITH US SO HE TOOK JOHNNY'S ARM AND LED HIM OFF THROUGH THE SHOW CALLING HIS ATTENTION AS HE WENT TO SEVERAL BEASTS WHICH WERE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN
5618-48830-0006 AND ACROSS PICCADILLY TO JERMYN STREET JOHN EAMES ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS ODD THAT HE SHOULD HAVE AN EARL LEANING ON HIS ARM AS HE PASSED ALONG THROUGH THE STREETS AT HOME IN HIS OWN LIFE HIS DAILY COMPANIONS WERE CRADELL
5618-48830-0007 AND AMELIA ROPER MISSUS LUPEX AND MISSUS ROPER THE DIFFERENCE WAS VERY GREAT AND YET HE FOUND IT QUITE AS EASY TO TALK TO THE EARL AS TO MISSUS LUPEX YOU KNOW THE DALES DOWN AT ALLINGTON OF COURSE SAID THE EARL
5618-48830-0008 OH YES I KNOW THEM BUT PERHAPS YOU NEVER MET THE COLONEL I DON'T THINK I EVER DID HE'S A QUEER SORT OF FELLOW VERY WELL IN HIS WAY BUT HE NEVER DOES ANYTHING HE AND MY SISTER LIVE AT TORQUAY
5618-48830-0009 AND AS FAR AS I CAN FIND OUT THEY NEITHER OF THEM HAVE ANY OCCUPATION OF ANY SORT HE'S COME UP TO TOWN NOW BECAUSE WE BOTH HAD TO MEET OUR FAMILY LAWYERS AND SIGN SOME PAPERS BUT HE LOOKS ON THE JOURNEY AS A GREAT HARDSHIP AS FOR ME
5618-48830-0010 MY SISTER AND CROFTS MAY TELL ME WHAT THEY LIKE BUT WHEN A MAN'S OUT IN THE OPEN AIR FOR EIGHT OR NINE HOURS EVERY DAY IT DOESN'T MUCH MATTER WHERE HE GOES TO SLEEP AFTER THAT THIS IS PAWKINS'S CAPITAL GOOD HOUSE
5618-48830-0011 BUT NOT SO GOOD AS IT USED TO BE WHILE OLD PAWKINS WAS ALIVE SHOW MISTER EAMES UP INTO A BEDROOM TO WASH HIS HANDS COLONEL DALE WAS MUCH LIKE HIS BROTHER IN FACE BUT WAS TALLER EVEN THINNER AND APPARENTLY OLDER
5618-48830-0012 WHEN EAMES WENT INTO THE SITTING ROOM THE COLONEL WAS THERE ALONE AND HAD TO TAKE UPON HIMSELF THE TROUBLE OF INTRODUCING HIMSELF HE DID NOT GET UP FROM HIS ARM CHAIR
5618-48830-0013 I KNEW YOUR FATHER AT GUESTWICK A GREAT MANY YEARS AGO THEN HE TURNED HIS FACE BACK TOWARDS THE FIRE AND SIGHED IT'S GOT VERY COLD THIS AFTERNOON SAID JOHNNY TRYING TO MAKE CONVERSATION IT'S ALWAYS COLD IN LONDON SAID THE COLONEL
5618-48830-0014 IN OPPOSITION TO VERY TERRIBLE OBSTACLES AND AS HE NOW LOOKED AT THE INTREPID LOVER
5618-48830-0015 AND THE PAWKINS OF THAT DAY HIMSELF STOOD BEHIND THE EARL'S ELBOW WHEN THE DINNER BEGAN AND HIMSELF REMOVED THE COVER FROM THE SOUP TUREEN LORD DE GUEST DID NOT REQUIRE MUCH PERSONAL ATTENTION BUT HE WOULD HAVE FELT ANNOYED IF THIS HADN'T BEEN DONE
5618-48830-0016 PAWKINS THEN TOOK HIS LORDSHIP'S ORDERS ABOUT THE WINE AND RETIRED
5618-48830-0017 IT ISN'T LIKE WHAT IT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO BUT THEN EVERYTHING OF THAT SORT HAS GOT WORSE AND WORSE I SUPPOSE IT HAS SAID THE COLONEL I REMEMBER WHEN OLD PAWKINS HAD AS GOOD A GLASS OF PORT AS I'VE GOT AT HOME OR NEARLY
5618-48830-0018 THEN EAMES TOOK HEART OF GRACE AND HAD HIS LAUGHTER OUT THE DINNER WAS VERY DULL AND BEFORE THE COLONEL WENT TO BED JOHNNY REGRETTED THAT HE HAD BEEN INDUCED TO DINE AT PAWKINS'S
5618-48830-0019 AND JOHN EAMES HAD PERHAPS RECEIVED AT HIS OFFICE SOME LITTLE ACCESSION OF DIGNITY FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF WHICH HE HAD BEEN NOT UNPLEASANTLY AWARE BUT AS HE SAT AT THE TABLE ON WHICH THERE WERE FOUR OR FIVE APPLES AND A PLATE OF DRIED NUTS
5618-48830-0020 LOOKING AT THE EARL AS HE ENDEAVOURED TO KEEP HIS EYES OPEN AND AT THE COLONEL TO WHOM IT SEEMED ABSOLUTELY A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE WHETHER HIS COMPANIONS WERE ASLEEP OR AWAKE HE CONFESSED TO HIMSELF THAT THE PRICE HE WAS PAYING
5618-48830-0021 WAS ALMOST TOO DEAR MISSUS ROPER'S TEA TABLE WAS NOT PLEASANT TO HIM
5618-48830-0022 WITH THE COMPANY OF TWO TIRED OLD MEN WITH WHOM HE SEEMED TO HAVE NO MUTUAL SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION ONCE OR TWICE HE TRIED A WORD WITH THE COLONEL FOR THE COLONEL SAT WITH HIS EYES OPEN LOOKING AT THE FIRE
5618-48830-0023 BUT HE WAS ANSWERED WITH MONOSYLLABLES AND IT WAS EVIDENT TO HIM THAT THE COLONEL DID NOT WISH TO TALK TO SIT STILL WITH HIS HANDS CLOSED OVER EACH OTHER ON HIS LAP WAS WORK ENOUGH FOR COLONEL DALE DURING HIS AFTER DINNER HOURS
5618-48830-0024 BUT THE EARL KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON DURING THAT TERRIBLE CONFLICT BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SLUMBER IN WHICH THE DROWSY GOD FAIRLY VANQUISHED HIM FOR SOME TWENTY MINUTES HIS CONSCIENCE WAS ALWAYS ACCUSING HIM OF TREATING HIS GUESTS BADLY
5618-48830-0026 COME JOHNNY FILL YOUR GLASS HE HAD ALREADY GOT INTO THE WAY OF CALLING HIS YOUNG FRIEND JOHNNY HAVING FOUND THAT MISSUS EAMES GENERALLY SPOKE OF HER SON BY THAT NAME I HAVE BEEN FILLING MY GLASS ALL THE TIME SAID EAMES
5618-48830-0027 TAKING THE DECANTER AGAIN IN HIS HAND AS HE SPOKE I'M GLAD YOU'VE FOUND SOMETHING TO AMUSE YOU FOR IT HAS SEEMED TO ME THAT YOU AND DALE HAVEN'T HAD MUCH TO SAY TO EACH OTHER I'VE BEEN LISTENING ALL THE TIME YOU'VE BEEN ASLEEP SAID THE COLONEL
5618-48830-0028 THEN THERE'S BEEN SOME EXCUSE FOR MY HOLDING MY TONGUE SAID THE EARL BY THE BY DALE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT FELLOW CROSBIE EAMES EARS WERE INSTANTLY ON THE ALERT AND THE SPIRIT OF DULLNESS VANISHED FROM HIM THINK OF HIM SAID THE COLONEL
5618-48830-0029 HE OUGHT TO HAVE EVERY BONE IN HIS SKIN BROKEN SAID THE EARL SO HE OUGHT SAID EAMES GETTING UP FROM HIS CHAIR IN HIS EAGERNESS AND SPEAKING IN A TONE SOMEWHAT LOUDER THAN WAS PERHAPS BECOMING IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS SENIORS SO HE OUGHT MY LORD
5618-48830-0030 HE IS THE MOST ABOMINABLE RASCAL THAT EVER I MET IN MY LIFE I WISH I WAS LILY DALE'S BROTHER THEN HE SAT DOWN AGAIN REMEMBERING THAT HE WAS SPEAKING IN THE PRESENCE OF LILY'S UNCLE AND OF THE FATHER OF BERNARD DALE
5618-48830-0031 WHO MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO OCCUPY THE PLACE OF LILY'S BROTHER THE COLONEL TURNED HIS HEAD ROUND AND LOOKED AT THE YOUNG MAN WITH SURPRISE I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAID EAMES BUT I HAVE KNOWN MISSUS DALE AND YOUR NIECES ALL MY LIFE
5618-48830-0032 OH HAVE YOU SAID THE COLONEL NEVERTHELESS IT IS PERHAPS AS WELL NOT TO MAKE TOO FREE WITH A YOUNG LADY'S NAME NOT THAT I BLAME YOU IN THE LEAST MISTER EAMES I SHOULD THINK NOT SAID THE EARL
5618-48830-0033 I SHALL TELL HIM MY MIND AND I BELIEVE YOU WILL DO THE SAME ON HEARING THIS JOHN EAMES WINKED AT THE EARL AND MADE A MOTION WITH HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE COLONEL
5618-48830-0034 AND THEN THE EARL WINKED BACK AT EAMES DE GUEST SAID THE COLONEL I THINK I'LL GO UPSTAIRS I ALWAYS HAVE A LITTLE ARROWROOT IN MY OWN ROOM I'LL RING THE BELL FOR A CANDLE SAID THE HOST THEN THE COLONEL WENT
5618-48830-0035 AND AS THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BEHIND HIM THE EARL RAISED HIS TWO HANDS AND UTTERED THAT SINGLE WORD NEGUS WHEREUPON JOHNNY BURST OUT LAUGHING
5618-48830-0036 I WONDER WHAT PAWKINS SAYS ABOUT HIM BUT I SUPPOSE THEY HAVE THEM OF ALL SORTS IN AN HOTEL
5618-48830-0037 WHETHER BERNARD SHOULDN'T PUNISH THE FELLOW FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE SOMEBODY OUGHT TO DO IT IT ISN'T RIGHT THAT HE SHOULD ESCAPE SOMEBODY OUGHT TO LET MISTER CROSBIE KNOW WHAT A SCOUNDREL HE HAS MADE HIMSELF I'D DO IT TO MORROW ONLY I'M AFRAID
5618-48830-0038 NO NO NO SAID THE EARL YOU ARE NOT THE RIGHT PERSON AT ALL WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO DO WITH IT YOU'VE MERELY KNOWN THEM AS FAMILY FRIENDS BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH NO I SUPPOSE NOT SAID EAMES SADLY
5618-48830-0039 PERHAPS IT'S BEST AS IT IS SAID THE EARL I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY GOOD WOULD BE GOT BY KNOCKING HIM OVER THE HEAD AND IF WE ARE TO BE CHRISTIANS I SUPPOSE WE OUGHT TO BE CHRISTIANS WHAT SORT OF A CHRISTIAN HAS HE BEEN
5618-48830-0040 THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH AND IF I WAS BERNARD I SHOULD BE VERY APT TO FORGET MY BIBLE LESSONS ABOUT MEEKNESS DO YOU KNOW MY LORD I SHOULD THINK IT THE MOST CHRISTIAN THING IN THE WORLD TO PITCH INTO HIM I SHOULD INDEED
5618-48830-0041 THERE ARE SOME THINGS FOR WHICH A MAN OUGHT TO BE BEATEN BLACK AND BLUE SO THAT HE SHOULDN'T DO THEM AGAIN EXACTLY YOU MIGHT SAY IT ISN'T CHRISTIAN TO HANG A MAN I'D ALWAYS HANG A MURDERER IT WASN'T RIGHT TO HANG MEN FOR STEALING SHEEP
5618-48830-0042 WELL I BELIEVE SO IF ANY FELLOW WANTED NOW TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH THE YOUNG LADY WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY HE'D HAVE JOHNNY REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT OR TWO BEFORE HE ANSWERED I'M NOT SO SURE OF THAT HE SAID
5618-48830-0043 MOURNFULLY AS THOUGH GRIEVING AT THE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CURRYING FAVOUR WITH LILY BY THRASHING HER LATE LOVER I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW MUCH ABOUT GIRLS SAID LORD DE GUEST BUT I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD BE SO
5618-48830-0044 I SHOULD FANCY THAT NOTHING WOULD PLEASE HER SO MUCH AS HEARING THAT HE HAD CAUGHT IT AND THAT ALL THE WORLD KNEW THAT HE'D CAUGHT IT THE EARL HAD DECLARED
5618-48830-0045 HE WAS NO DOUBT RIGHT IF I THOUGHT SO SAID EAMES I'D FIND HIM OUT TO MORROW WHY SO WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE TO YOU THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER PAUSE DURING WHICH JOHNNY LOOKED VERY SHEEPISH
5618-48830-0046 YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH MISS LILY DALE I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT BEING IN LOVE WITH HER SAID JOHNNY TURNING VERY RED AS HE SPOKE AND THEN HE MADE UP HIS MIND IN A WILD SORT OF WAY TO TELL ALL THE TRUTH TO HIS FRIEND
5618-48830-0047 PAWKINS'S PORT WINE MAY PERHAPS HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE RESOLUTION BUT I'D GO THROUGH FIRE AND WATER FOR HER MY LORD I KNEW HER YEARS BEFORE HE HAD EVER SEEN HER AND HAVE LOVED HER A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN HE WILL EVER LOVE ANY ONE
5618-48830-0048 WHEN I HEARD THAT SHE HAD ACCEPTED HIM I HAD HALF A MIND TO CUT MY OWN THROAT OR ELSE HIS HIGHTY TIGHTY SAID THE EARL IT'S VERY RIDICULOUS I KNOW SAID JOHNNY AND OF COURSE SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ACCEPTED ME
5618-48830-0049 I DON'T SEE THAT AT ALL I HAVEN'T A SHILLING IN THE WORLD GIRLS DON'T CARE MUCH FOR THAT AND THEN A CLERK IN THE INCOME TAX OFFICE IT'S SUCH A POOR THING THE OTHER FELLOW WAS ONLY A CLERK IN ANOTHER OFFICE
5618-48830-0050 THE EARL LIVING DOWN AT GUESTWICK DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE INCOME TAX OFFICE IN THE CITY
5618-48830-0051 AND SEPARATED BY AS IMPASSABLE A GULF OH YES SAID JOHNNY BUT HIS OFFICE IS ANOTHER KIND OF THING AND THEN HE WAS A SWELL HIMSELF BY GEORGE I DON'T SEE IT SAID THE EARL
5618-48830-0052 I DON'T WONDER A BIT AT HER ACCEPTING A FELLOW LIKE THAT I HATED HIM THE FIRST MOMENT I SAW HIM BUT THAT'S NO REASON SHE SHOULD HATE HIM HE HAD THAT SORT OF MANNER YOU KNOW HE WAS A SWELL AND GIRLS LIKE THAT KIND OF THING
5618-48830-0053 WHEN I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED I COULD NOT HELP TELLING HER THEN BUT IT SEEMS TO ME MY DEAR FELLOW THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO CROSBIE THAT IS TO SAY IF YOU'VE A MIND TO I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN MY LORD
5618-48830-0054 I AM NOT A BIT OBLIGED TO HIM IT'S MY BELIEF THAT ALL THIS WILL ABOUT KILL HER AS TO MYSELF IF I THOUGHT SHE'D EVER HAVE ME THEN HE WAS AGAIN SILENT AND THE EARL COULD SEE THAT THE TEARS WERE IN HIS EYES
5618-48830-0055 AND I'LL GIVE YOU A BIT OF ADVICE YOU COME DOWN AND SPEND YOUR CHRISTMAS WITH ME AT GUESTWICK OH MY LORD NEVER MIND MY LORDING ME BUT DO AS I TELL YOU LADY JULIA SENT YOU A MESSAGE
5618-48830-0056 THOUGH I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT TILL NOW SHE WANTS TO THANK YOU HERSELF FOR WHAT YOU DID IN THE FIELD THAT'S ALL NONSENSE MY LORD VERY WELL YOU CAN TELL HER SO YOU MAY TAKE MY WORD FOR THIS TOO MY SISTER HATES CROSBIE QUITE AS MUCH AS YOU DO
5618-48830-0057 I THINK SHE'D PITCH INTO HIM AS YOU CALL IT HERSELF IF SHE KNEW HOW YOU COME DOWN TO GUESTWICK FOR THE CHRISTMAS AND THEN GO OVER TO ALLINGTON AND TELL THEM ALL PLAINLY WHAT YOU MEAN I COULDN'T SAY A WORD TO HER NOW SAY IT TO THE SQUIRE THEN
5618-48830-0058 GO TO HIM AND TELL HIM WHAT YOU MEAN HOLDING YOUR HEAD UP LIKE A MAN DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT SWELLS THE MAN WHO MEANS HONESTLY IS THE BEST SWELL I KNOW HE'S THE ONLY SWELL I RECOGNIZE
5618-48830-0059 AND SAY YOU COME FROM ME FROM GUESTWICK MANOR TELL HIM THAT IF HE'LL PUT A LITTLE STICK UNDER THE POT TO MAKE IT BOIL I'LL PUT A BIGGER ONE HE'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS OH NO MY LORD BUT I SAY OH YES
5618-48830-0060 AND I'VE A SNEAKING KINDNESS FOR YOU TOO MASTER JOHNNY LORD BLESS YOU I KNEW YOUR FATHER AS WELL AS I EVER KNEW ANY MAN AND TO TELL THE TRUTH I BELIEVE I HELPED TO RUIN HIM HE HELD LAND OF ME YOU KNOW
5618-48830-0061 AND THERE CAN'T BE ANY DOUBT THAT HE DID RUIN HIMSELF HE KNEW NO MORE ABOUT A BEAST WHEN HE'D DONE THAN THAN THAN THAT WAITER IF HE'D GONE ON TO THIS DAY HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY WISER JOHNNY SAT SILENT WITH HIS EYES FULL OF TEARS
5618-48830-0062 WHAT WAS HE TO SAY TO HIS FRIEND YOU COME DOWN WITH ME CONTINUED THE EARL AND YOU'LL FIND WE'LL MAKE IT ALL STRAIGHT I DARESAY YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT NOT SPEAKING TO THE GIRL JUST AT PRESENT BUT TELL EVERYTHING TO THE UNCLE AND THEN TO THE MOTHER
5618-48830-0063 AND ABOVE ALL THINGS NEVER THINK THAT YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH YOURSELF A MAN SHOULD NEVER THINK THAT MY BELIEF IS THAT IN LIFE PEOPLE WILL TAKE YOU VERY MUCH AT YOUR OWN RECKONING IF YOU ARE MADE OF DIRT LIKE THAT FELLOW CROSBIE
5618-48830-0064 YOU'LL BE FOUND OUT AT LAST NO DOUBT BUT THEN I DON'T THINK YOU ARE MADE OF DIRT I HOPE NOT AND SO DO I YOU CAN COME DOWN I SUPPOSE WITH ME THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW I'M AFRAID NOT I HAVE HAD ALL MY LEAVE
5618-48830-0065 SHALL I WRITE TO OLD BUFFLE AND ASK IT AS A FAVOUR NO SAID JOHNNY I SHOULDN'T LIKE THAT BUT I'LL SEE TO MORROW AND THEN I'LL LET YOU KNOW I CAN GO DOWN BY THE MAIL TRAIN ON SATURDAY AT ANY RATE THAT WON'T BE COMFORTABLE
5618-48830-0066 SEE AND COME WITH ME IF YOU CAN NOW GOOD NIGHT MY DEAR FELLOW AND REMEMBER THIS WHEN I SAY A THING I MEAN IT I THINK I MAY BOAST THAT I NEVER YET WENT BACK FROM MY WORD THE EARL AS HE SPOKE GAVE HIS LEFT HAND TO HIS GUEST
5618-48830-0067 HE TAPPED HIS OWN BREAST THRICE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND AS HE WENT THROUGH THE LITTLE SCENE JOHN EAMES FELT THAT HE WAS EVERY INCH AN EARL I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO YOU MY LORD SAY NOTHING NOT A WORD MORE TO ME
5618-48830-0068 BUT SAY TO YOURSELF THAT FAINT HEART NEVER WON FAIR LADY GOOD NIGHT MY DEAR BOY GOOD NIGHT I DINE OUT TO MORROW BUT YOU CAN CALL AND LET ME KNOW AT ABOUT SIX EAMES THEN LEFT THE ROOM WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
5618-48830-0069 WOULD HE BE JUSTIFIED IN TAKING THE EARL AT HIS WORD
5618-48831-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY THREE THE TIME WILL COME DID YOU HEAR THAT YOUNG EAMES IS STAYING AT GUESTWICK MANOR AS THESE WERE THE FIRST WORDS WHICH THE SQUIRE SPOKE TO MISSUS DALE AS THEY WALKED TOGETHER UP TO THE GREAT HOUSE
5618-48831-0001 AT GUESTWICK MANOR SAID MISSUS DALE
5618-48831-0002 DO YOU HEAR THAT BELL THERE'S PROMOTION FOR MASTER JOHNNY DON'T YOU REMEMBER MAMMA SAID BELL THAT HE HELPED HIS LORDSHIP IN HIS TROUBLE WITH THE BULL LILY WHO REMEMBERED ACCURATELY ALL THE PASSAGES OF HER LAST INTERVIEW WITH JOHN EAMES SAID NOTHING
5618-48831-0003 BUT FELT IN SOME SORT SORE AT THE IDEA THAT HE SHOULD BE SO NEAR HER AT SUCH A TIME IN SOME UNCONSCIOUS WAY SHE HAD LIKED HIM FOR COMING TO HER AND SAYING ALL THAT HE DID SAY SHE VALUED HIM MORE HIGHLY
5618-48831-0004 AFTER THAT SCENE THAN SHE DID BEFORE BUT NOW SHE WOULD FEEL HERSELF INJURED AND HURT IF HE EVER MADE HIS WAY INTO HER PRESENCE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES AS THEY EXISTED
5618-48831-0005 I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT THAT LORD DE GUEST WAS THE MAN TO SHOW SO MUCH GRATITUDE FOR SO SLIGHT A FAVOUR SAID THE SQUIRE HOWEVER I'M GOING TO DINE THERE TO MORROW TO MEET YOUNG EAMES SAID MISSUS DALE
5618-48831-0006 YES ESPECIALLY TO MEET YOUNG EAMES AT LEAST I'VE BEEN VERY SPECIALLY ASKED TO COME AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT HE IS TO BE THERE AND IS BERNARD GOING INDEED I'M NOT SAID BERNARD I SHALL COME OVER AND DINE WITH YOU
5618-48831-0007 A HALF FORMED IDEA FLITTED ACROSS LILY'S MIND TEACHING HER TO IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT SHE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE CONCERNED IN THIS ARRANGEMENT BUT THE THOUGHT VANISHED AS QUICKLY AS IT CAME MERELY LEAVING SOME SORENESS BEHIND IT
5618-48831-0008 THERE ARE CERTAIN MALADIES WHICH MAKE THE WHOLE BODY SORE THE PATIENT LET HIM BE TOUCHED ON ANY POINT LET HIM EVEN BE NEARLY TOUCHED WILL ROAR WITH AGONY AS THOUGH HIS WHOLE BODY HAD BEEN BRUISED SO IT IS ALSO WITH MALADIES OF THE MIND
5618-48831-0009 BECAUSE SHE HAD THE STRENGTH TO WALK AS THOUGH SHE DID NOT BEAR IT NOTHING HAPPENED TO HER OR IN HER PRESENCE THAT DID NOT IN SOME WAY CONNECT ITSELF WITH HER MISERY HER UNCLE WAS GOING OVER TO MEET JOHN EAMES AT LORD DE GUEST'S
5618-48831-0010 OF COURSE THE MEN THERE WOULD TALK ABOUT HER AND ALL SUCH TALKING WAS AN INJURY TO HER THE AFTERNOON OF THAT DAY DID NOT PASS AWAY BRIGHTLY AS LONG AS THE SERVANTS WERE IN THE ROOM THE DINNER WENT ON
5618-48831-0011 MUCH AS OTHER DINNERS AT SUCH TIMES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HYPOCRISY MUST ALWAYS BE PRACTISED IN CLOSELY DOMESTIC CIRCLES AT MIXED DINNER PARTIES PEOPLE CAN TALK BEFORE RICHARD AND WILLIAM
5618-48831-0012 PEOPLE SO MIXED DO NOT TALK TOGETHER THEIR INWARD HOME THOUGHTS BUT WHEN CLOSE FRIENDS ARE TOGETHER A LITTLE CONSCIOUS RETICENCE IS PRACTISED TILL THE DOOR IS TILED AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS THAT CONSCIOUS RETICENCE
5618-48831-0013 WAS OF SERVICE AND CREATED AN EFFECT WHICH WAS SALUTARY WHEN THE DOOR WAS TILED AND WHEN THE SERVANTS WERE GONE HOW COULD THEY BE MERRY TOGETHER BY WHAT MIRTH SHOULD THE BEARDS BE MADE TO WAG ON THAT CHRISTMAS DAY
5618-48831-0014 HE WAS WITH LORD DE GUEST AT PAWKINS'S WHY DIDN'T YOU GO AND SEE HIM ASKED MISSUS DALE WELL I DON'T KNOW HE DID NOT SEEM TO WISH IT I SHALL GO DOWN TO TORQUAY IN FEBRUARY I MUST BE UP IN LONDON YOU KNOW IN A FORTNIGHT FOR GOOD
5618-48831-0015 MAKING HER FEEL THAT HER WOUND WAS AGAIN OPENED I WANT HIM TO GIVE UP HIS PROFESSION ALTOGETHER SAID THE SQUIRE SPEAKING FIRMLY AND SLOWLY IT WOULD BE BETTER I THINK FOR BOTH OF US THAT HE SHOULD DO SO
5618-48831-0016 WOULD IT BE WISE AT HIS TIME OF LIFE SAID MISSUS DALE AND WHEN HE HAS BEEN DOING SO WELL I THINK IT WOULD BE WISE IF HE WERE MY SON IT WOULD BE THOUGHT BETTER THAT HE SHOULD LIVE HERE UPON THE PROPERTY AMONG THE PEOPLE
5618-48831-0017 WHO ARE TO BECOME HIS TENANTS THAN REMAIN UP IN LONDON OR PERHAPS BE SENT TO INDIA HE HAS ONE PROFESSION AS THE HEIR OF THIS PLACE AND THAT I THINK SHOULD BE ENOUGH I SHOULD HAVE BUT AN IDLE LIFE OF IT DOWN HERE SAID BERNARD
5618-48831-0018 AND SAT QUITE SILENT WITH DEMURE COUNTENANCE PERHAPS EVEN WITH SOMETHING OF STERNNESS IN HER FACE BUT THE FACT IS SAID MISSUS DALE SPEAKING IN A LOW TONE AND HAVING WELL CONSIDERED WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO SAY
5618-48831-0019 THAT BERNARD IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS YOUR SON WHY NOT SAID THE SQUIRE I HAVE EVEN OFFERED TO SETTLE THE PROPERTY ON HIM IF HE WILL LEAVE THE SERVICE YOU DO NOT OWE HIM SO MUCH AS YOU WOULD OWE YOUR SON AND THEREFORE
5618-48831-0020 HE DOES NOT OWE YOU AS MUCH AS HE WOULD OWE HIS FATHER IF YOU MEAN THAT I CANNOT CONSTRAIN HIM I KNOW THAT WELL ENOUGH AS REGARDS MONEY I HAVE OFFERED TO DO FOR HIM QUITE AS MUCH AS ANY FATHER WOULD FEEL CALLED UPON TO DO FOR AN ONLY SON
5618-48831-0021 FEELING THAT HE COULD NOT GO ON IN BELL'S PRESENCE IF HE SHOULD MARRY SAID MISSUS DALE IT MAY WELL BE THAT HIS WIFE WOULD LIKE A HOUSE OF HER OWN WOULDN'T SHE HAVE THIS HOUSE SAID THE SQUIRE ANGRILY ISN'T IT BIG ENOUGH I ONLY WANT ONE ROOM FOR MYSELF
5618-48831-0022 REGARDING HER WITH THAT PAINFUL SPECIAL TENDERNESS LILY WHO WAS SITTING NEXT TO MISSUS DALE PUT HER HAND OUT SECRETLY AND GOT HOLD OF HER MOTHER'S THEREBY INDICATING THAT SHE DID NOT INTEND TO OCCUPY THE CELL OFFERED TO HER BY HER UNCLE
5618-48831-0023 OR TO LOOK TO HIM AS THE COMPANION OF HER MONASTIC SECLUSION AFTER THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE THEN SAID AS TO BERNARD'S PROSPECTS MISSUS HEARN IS DINING AT THE VICARAGE I SUPPOSE ASKED THE SQUIRE
5618-48831-0024 YES SHE WENT IN AFTER CHURCH SAID BELL I SAW HER GO WITH MISSUS BOYCE SHE TOLD ME SHE NEVER WOULD DINE WITH THEM AGAIN AFTER DARK IN WINTER SAID MISSUS DALE THE LAST TIME SHE WAS THERE THE BOY LET THE LAMP BLOW OUT AS SHE WAS GOING HOME AND SHE LOST HER WAY
5618-48831-0025 THE TRUTH WAS SHE WAS ANGRY BECAUSE MISTER BOYCE DIDN'T GO WITH HER SHE'S ALWAYS ANGRY SAID THE SQUIRE SHE HARDLY SPEAKS TO ME NOW WHEN SHE PAID HER RENT THE OTHER DAY TO JOLLIFFE SHE SAID SHE HOPED IT WOULD DO ME MUCH GOOD AS THOUGH SHE THOUGHT ME A BRUTE FOR TAKING IT
5618-48831-0026 SHE'S VERY OLD YOU KNOW SAID BELL I'D GIVE HER THE HOUSE FOR NOTHING IF I WERE YOU UNCLE SAID LILY NO MY DEAR IF YOU WERE ME YOU WOULD NOT I SHOULD BE VERY WRONG TO DO SO
5618-48831-0027 WHY SHOULD MISSUS HEARN HAVE HER HOUSE FOR NOTHING ANY MORE THAN HER MEAT OR HER CLOTHES IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE REASONABLE WERE I TO GIVE HER SO MUCH MONEY INTO HER HAND YEARLY BUT IT WOULD BE WRONG IN ME TO DO SO SEEING THAT SHE IS NOT AN OBJECT OF CHARITY
5618-48831-0028 AND IT WOULD BE WRONG IN HER TO TAKE IT AND SHE WOULDN'T TAKE IT SAID MISSUS DALE I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD BUT IF SHE DID I'M SURE SHE WOULD GRUMBLE BECAUSE IT WASN'T DOUBLE THE AMOUNT AND IF MISTER BOYCE HAD GONE HOME WITH HER
5618-48831-0029 SHE WOULD HAVE GRUMBLED BECAUSE HE WALKED TOO FAST SHE IS VERY OLD SAID BELL AGAIN BUT NEVERTHELESS SHE OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER THAN TO SPEAK DISPARAGINGLY OF ME TO MY SERVANTS SHE SHOULD HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR HERSELF
5618-48831-0030 AND THE SQUIRE SHOWED BY THE TONE OF HIS VOICE THAT HE THOUGHT VERY MUCH ABOUT IT IT WAS VERY LONG AND VERY DULL THAT CHRISTMAS EVENING MAKING BERNARD FEEL STRONGLY THAT HE WOULD BE VERY FOOLISH TO GIVE UP HIS PROFESSION
5618-48831-0031 AND TIE HIMSELF DOWN TO A LIFE AT ALLINGTON WOMEN ARE MORE ACCUSTOMED THAN MEN TO LONG DULL UNEMPLOYED HOURS AND THEREFORE MISSUS DALE AND HER DAUGHTERS BORE THE TEDIUM COURAGEOUSLY WHILE HE YAWNED STRETCHED HIMSELF
5618-48831-0032 THEY SAT DEMURELY LISTENING AS THE SQUIRE LAID DOWN THE LAW ON SMALL MATTERS AND CONTRADICTING HIM OCCASIONALLY WHEN THE SPIRIT OF EITHER OF THEM PROMPTED HER SPECIALLY TO DO SO OF COURSE YOU KNOW MUCH BETTER THAN I DO HE WOULD SAY
5618-48831-0033 NOT AT ALL MISSUS DALE WOULD ANSWER I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT SO THE EVENING WORE ITSELF AWAY AND WHEN THE SQUIRE WAS LEFT ALONE AT HALF PAST NINE HE DID NOT FEEL THAT THE DAY HAD PASSED BADLY WITH HIM
5618-48831-0034 THAT WAS HIS STYLE OF LIFE AND HE EXPECTED NO MORE FROM IT THAN HE GOT HE DID NOT LOOK TO FIND THINGS VERY PLEASANT AND IF NOT HAPPY HE WAS AT ANY RATE CONTENTED
5618-48831-0035 ONLY THINK OF JOHNNY EAMES BEING AT GUESTWICK MANOR SAID BELL AS THEY WERE GOING HOME I DON'T SEE WHY HE SHOULDN'T BE THERE SAID LILY I WOULD RATHER IT SHOULD BE HE THAN I BECAUSE LADY JULIA IS SO GRUMPY
5618-48831-0036 BUT ASKING YOUR UNCLE CHRISTOPHER ESPECIALLY TO MEET HIM SAID MISSUS DALE THERE MUST BE SOME REASON FOR IT THEN LILY FELT THE SORENESS COME UPON HER AGAIN AND SPOKE NO FURTHER UPON THE SUBJECT
5618-48831-0037 AND THAT LILY'S SORENESS WAS NOT FALSE IN ITS MYSTERIOUS FOREBODINGS EAMES ON THE EVENING AFTER HIS DINNER AT PAWKINS'S HAD SEEN THE EARL AND EXPLAINED TO HIM
5618-48831-0038 BUT THAT HE COULD REMAIN OVER THE TUESDAY HE MUST BE AT HIS OFFICE BY TWELVE ON WEDNESDAY AND COULD MANAGE TO DO THAT BY AN EARLY TRAIN FROM GUESTWICK
5618-48831-0039 VERY WELL JOHNNY SAID THE EARL TALKING TO HIS YOUNG FRIEND WITH THE BEDROOM CANDLE IN HIS HAND AS HE WAS GOING UP TO DRESS
5622-19214-0000 ASHAMED OF LOVING IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THESE PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE PITILESS TOWARDS HAPPY LOVERS THEY REMAIN WHEN THE LATTER MOST DESIRE TO BE LEFT ALONE LOVERS HAVE NO NEED OF ANY PEOPLE WHATEVER WITH COSETTE AND BEHIND HER THERE HAD ENTERED A MAN WITH WHITE HAIR
5622-19214-0001 WHO WAS GRAVE YET SMILING THOUGH WITH A VAGUE AND HEARTRENDING SMILE
5622-19214-0002 AS THE PORTER HAD SAID ENTIRELY IN BLACK IN PERFECTLY NEW GARMENTS AND WITH A WHITE CRAVAT
5622-19214-0003 STILL HIS PORTER'S SCENT WAS AROUSED

5622-19214-0005 HE'S A LEARNED MAN WHAT THEN IS THAT HIS FAULT

5622-19214-0009 OH HOW WICKED IT WAS OF YOU TO GO TO THAT BATTLE WHAT HAD I DONE TO YOU I PARDON YOU BUT YOU WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE AGO WHEN THEY CAME TO TELL US TO COME TO YOU I STILL THOUGHT THAT I WAS ABOUT TO DIE BUT IT WAS FROM JOY

5622-19214-0011 AND THEN IT SEEMS THAT THEY CUT YOUR FLESH WITH THE SCISSORS THAT IS FRIGHTFUL I HAVE CRIED TILL I HAVE NO EYES LEFT IT IS QUEER THAT A PERSON CAN SUFFER LIKE THAT YOUR GRANDFATHER HAS A VERY KINDLY AIR DON'T DISTURB YOURSELF DON'T RISE ON YOUR ELBOW
5622-19214-0012 YOU WILL INJURE YOURSELF OH HOW HAPPY I AM SO OUR UNHAPPINESS IS OVER I AM QUITE FOOLISH I HAD
5622-19214-0013 ANGEL IS THE ONLY WORD IN THE LANGUAGE WHICH CANNOT BE WORN OUT NO OTHER WORD COULD RESIST THE MERCILESS USE WHICH LOVERS MAKE OF IT THEN AS THERE WERE SPECTATORS THEY PAUSED AND SAID NOT A WORD MORE CONTENTING THEMSELVES WITH SOFTLY TOUCHING EACH OTHER'S HANDS

5622-19214-0015 WHAT HAS MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE TO DO WITH THE QUESTION INQUIRED THE STARTLED GRANDFATHER I AM SHE REPLIED COSETTE
5622-19214-0016 FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS
5622-19214-0017 FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR ONE MIGHT AS WELL SAY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AS FOR MARIUS AND COSETTE THEY WERE GAZING AT EACH OTHER WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON THEY HARDLY HEEDED THIS DETAIL
5622-19214-0018 CHAPTER FIVE DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY IN A FOREST RATHER THAN WITH A NOTARY
5622-41172-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY TWO BEFORE VRONSKY'S DEPARTURE FOR THE ELECTIONS ANNA HAD REFLECTED THAT THE SCENES CONSTANTLY REPEATED BETWEEN THEM EACH TIME HE LEFT HOME MIGHT ONLY MAKE HIM COLD TO HER INSTEAD OF ATTACHING HIM TO HER
5622-41172-0001 AND RESOLVED TO DO ALL SHE COULD TO CONTROL HERSELF SO AS TO BEAR THE PARTING WITH COMPOSURE BUT THE COLD SEVERE GLANCE WITH WHICH HE HAD LOOKED AT HER WHEN HE CAME TO TELL HER HE WAS GOING HAD WOUNDED HER AND BEFORE HE HAD STARTED
5622-41172-0002 HER PEACE OF MIND WAS DESTROYED IN SOLITUDE AFTERWARDS THINKING OVER THAT GLANCE WHICH HAD EXPRESSED HIS RIGHT TO FREEDOM SHE CAME AS SHE ALWAYS DID TO THE SAME POINT THE SENSE OF HER OWN HUMILIATION
5622-41172-0003 SHOWS THE BEGINNING OF INDIFFERENCE AND THOUGH SHE FELT SURE THAT A COLDNESS WAS BEGINNING THERE WAS NOTHING SHE COULD DO SHE COULD NOT IN ANY WAY ALTER HER RELATIONS TO HIM JUST AS BEFORE
5622-41172-0004 AND SHE BEGAN TO LONG FOR THAT AND MADE UP HER MIND TO AGREE TO IT THE FIRST TIME
5622-41172-0005 ABSORBED IN SUCH THOUGHTS SHE PASSED FIVE DAYS WITHOUT HIM THE FIVE DAYS THAT HE WAS TO BE AT THE ELECTIONS WALKS
5622-41172-0006 READING OF ONE BOOK AFTER ANOTHER FILLED UP HER TIME BUT ON THE SIXTH DAY WHEN THE COACHMAN CAME BACK WITHOUT HIM SHE FELT THAT NOW SHE WAS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF STIFLING THE THOUGHT OF HIM AND OF WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE JUST AT THAT TIME HER LITTLE GIRL WAS TAKEN ILL
5622-41172-0007 ANNA BEGAN TO LOOK AFTER HER BUT EVEN THAT DID NOT DISTRACT HER MIND ESPECIALLY AS THE ILLNESS WAS NOT SERIOUS HOWEVER HARD SHE TRIED SHE COULD NOT LOVE THIS LITTLE CHILD AND TO FEIGN LOVE WAS BEYOND HER POWERS
5622-41172-0008 TOWARDS THE EVENING OF THAT DAY STILL ALONE ANNA WAS IN SUCH A PANIC ABOUT HIM THAT SHE DECIDED TO START FOR THE TOWN BUT ON SECOND THOUGHTS WROTE HIM THE CONTRADICTORY LETTER THAT VRONSKY RECEIVED
5622-41172-0009 AND WITHOUT READING IT THROUGH SENT IT OFF BY A SPECIAL MESSENGER THE NEXT MORNING SHE RECEIVED HIS LETTER AND REGRETTED HER OWN SHE DREADED A REPETITION OF THE SEVERE LOOK HE HAD FLUNG AT HER AT PARTING ESPECIALLY WHEN HE KNEW THAT THE BABY WAS NOT DANGEROUSLY ILL
5622-41172-0010 LET HIM WEARY OF HER BUT HE WOULD BE HERE WITH HER SO THAT SHE WOULD SEE HIM WOULD KNOW OF EVERY ACTION HE TOOK SHE WAS SITTING IN THE DRAWING ROOM NEAR A LAMP WITH A NEW VOLUME OF TAINE AND AS SHE READ LISTENING TO THE SOUND OF THE WIND OUTSIDE
5622-41172-0011 AND EVERY MINUTE EXPECTING THE CARRIAGE TO ARRIVE SEVERAL TIMES SHE HAD FANCIED SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF WHEELS BUT SHE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN AT LAST SHE HEARD NOT THE SOUND OF WHEELS BUT THE COACHMAN'S SHOUT AND THE DULL RUMBLE IN THE COVERED ENTRY
5622-41172-0012 EVEN PRINCESS VARVARA PLAYING PATIENCE CONFIRMED THIS AND ANNA FLUSHING HOTLY GOT UP BUT INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN AS SHE HAD DONE TWICE BEFORE SHE STOOD STILL SHE SUDDENLY FELT ASHAMED OF HER DUPLICITY
5622-41172-0013 BUT EVEN MORE SHE DREADED HOW HE MIGHT MEET HER ALL FEELING OF WOUNDED PRIDE HAD PASSED NOW SHE WAS ONLY AFRAID OF THE EXPRESSION OF HIS DISPLEASURE SHE REMEMBERED THAT HER CHILD HAD BEEN PERFECTLY WELL AGAIN FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS
5622-41172-0014 SHE FELT POSITIVELY VEXED WITH HER FOR GETTING BETTER FROM THE VERY MOMENT HER LETTER WAS SENT OFF THEN SHE THOUGHT OF HIM THAT HE WAS HERE ALL OF HIM WITH HIS HANDS HIS EYES SHE HEARD HIS VOICE AND FORGETTING EVERYTHING
5622-41172-0015 SHE RAN JOYFULLY TO MEET HIM WELL HOW IS ANNIE HE SAID TIMIDLY FROM BELOW LOOKING UP TO ANNA AS SHE RAN DOWN TO HIM HE WAS SITTING ON A CHAIR AND A FOOTMAN WAS PULLING OFF HIS WARM OVER BOOT
5622-41172-0016 SHE IS BETTER AND YOU HE SAID SHAKING HIMSELF SHE TOOK HIS HAND IN BOTH OF HERS AND DREW IT TO HER WAIST NEVER TAKING HER EYES OFF HIM WELL I'M GLAD HE SAID COLDLY SCANNING HER
5622-41172-0017 AND ARE YOU WELL HE SAID WIPING HIS DAMP BEARD WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND KISSING HER HAND NEVER MIND SHE THOUGHT ONLY LET HIM BE HERE AND SO LONG AS HE'S HERE HE CANNOT HE DARE NOT CEASE TO LOVE ME
5622-41172-0018 THE EVENING WAS SPENT HAPPILY AND GAILY IN THE PRESENCE OF PRINCESS VARVARA WHO COMPLAINED TO HIM THAT ANNA HAD BEEN TAKING MORPHINE IN HIS ABSENCE WHAT AM I TO DO I COULDN'T SLEEP MY THOUGHTS PREVENTED ME
5622-41172-0019 WHEN HE'S HERE I NEVER TAKE IT HARDLY EVER HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE ELECTION AND ANNA KNEW HOW BY ADROIT QUESTIONS TO BRING HIM TO WHAT GAVE HIM MOST PLEASURE HIS OWN SUCCESS
5622-41172-0020 SHE TOLD HIM OF EVERYTHING THAT INTERESTED HIM AT HOME AND ALL THAT SHE TOLD HIM WAS OF THE MOST CHEERFUL DESCRIPTION BUT LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN THEY WERE ALONE ANNA SEEING THAT SHE HAD REGAINED COMPLETE POSSESSION OF HIM
5622-41172-0021 SHE SAID TELL ME FRANKLY YOU WERE VEXED AT GETTING MY LETTER AND YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME AS SOON AS SHE HAD SAID IT SHE FELT THAT HOWEVER WARM HIS FEELINGS WERE TO HER HE HAD NOT FORGIVEN HER FOR THAT YES HE SAID
5622-41172-0022 THE LETTER WAS SO STRANGE FIRST ANNIE ILL AND THEN YOU THOUGHT OF COMING YOURSELF IT WAS ALL THE TRUTH OH I DON'T DOUBT IT YES YOU DO DOUBT IT
5622-41172-0023 THE DUTY OF GOING TO A CONCERT BUT WE WON'T TALK ABOUT IT HE SAID WHY NOT TALK ABOUT IT SHE SAID
5622-41172-0024 I ONLY MEANT TO SAY THAT MATTERS OF REAL IMPORTANCE MAY TURN UP NOW FOR INSTANCE I SHALL HAVE TO GO TO MOSCOW TO ARRANGE ABOUT THE HOUSE OH ANNA WHY ARE YOU SO IRRITABLE DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU
5622-41172-0025 ANNA THAT'S CRUEL I AM READY TO GIVE UP MY WHOLE LIFE BUT SHE DID NOT HEAR HIM IF YOU GO TO MOSCOW I WILL GO TOO I WILL NOT STAY HERE EITHER WE MUST SEPARATE OR ELSE LIVE TOGETHER
5622-44585-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN FLUENCY THROUGH PREPARATION
5622-44585-0001 AT FIRST BLUSH IT WOULD SEEM THAT FLUENCY CONSISTS IN A READY EASY USE OF WORDS
5622-44585-0002 NOT SO THE FLOWING QUALITY OF SPEECH IS MUCH MORE FOR IT IS A COMPOSITE EFFECT WITH EACH OF ITS PRIOR CONDITIONS DESERVING OF CAREFUL NOTICE THE SOURCES OF FLUENCY
5622-44585-0003 ENTIRELY A MATTER OF PREPARATION CERTAINLY NATIVE GIFTS FIGURE LARGELY HERE AS IN EVERY ART
5622-44585-0004 BUT EVEN NATURAL FACILITY IS DEPENDENT ON THE VERY SAME LAWS OF PREPARATION THAT HOLD GOOD FOR THE MAN OF SUPPOSEDLY SMALL NATIVE ENDOWMENT LET THIS ENCOURAGE YOU IF LIKE MOSES YOU ARE PRONE TO COMPLAIN THAT YOU ARE NOT A READY SPEAKER
5622-44585-0005 HAVE YOU EVER STOPPED TO ANALYZE THAT EXPRESSION A READY SPEAKER READINESS IN ITS PRIME SENSE IS PREPAREDNESS AND THEY ARE MOST READY WHO ARE BEST PREPARED QUICK FIRING DEPENDS MORE ON THE ALERT FINGER THAN ON THE HAIR TRIGGER
5622-44585-0006 PREPARATION MAY BE EITHER GENERAL OR SPECIFIC USUALLY IT SHOULD BE BOTH A LIFE TIME OF READING OF COMPANIONSHIP WITH STIRRING THOUGHTS OF WRESTLING WITH THE PROBLEMS OF LIFE THIS CONSTITUTES A GENERAL PREPARATION OF INESTIMABLE WORTH OUT OF A WELL STORED MIND AND RICHER STILL A BROAD EXPERIENCE AND BEST OF ALL A WARMLY SYMPATHETIC HEART THE SPEAKER WILL HAVE TO DRAW MUCH MATERIAL THAT NO IMMEDIATE STUDY COULD PROVIDE
5622-44585-0007 GENERAL PREPARATION CONSISTS OF ALL THAT A MAN HAS PUT INTO HIMSELF ALL THAT HEREDITY AND ENVIRONMENT HAVE INSTILLED INTO HIM
5622-44585-0008 THE TALKER GAINS AS MUCH FROM HIS CONVERSATION AS THE LISTENER YOU SOMETIMES BEGIN TO CONVERSE ON A SUBJECT THINKING YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE TO SAY BUT ONE IDEA GIVES BIRTH TO ANOTHER AND YOU ARE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THE MORE YOU GIVE THE MORE YOU HAVE TO GIVE
5622-44585-0009 LONGFELLOW SAID A SINGLE CONVERSATION ACROSS THE TABLE WITH A WISE MAN IS BETTER THAN TEN YEARS STUDY OF BOOKS AND HOLMES WHIMSICALLY YET NONE THE LESS TRUTHFULLY DECLARED THAT HALF THE TIME HE TALKED TO FIND OUT WHAT HE THOUGHT BUT THAT METHOD MUST NOT BE APPLIED ON THE PLATFORM
5622-44585-0010 AFTER ALL THIS ENRICHMENT OF LIFE BY STORAGE MUST COME THE SPECIAL PREPARATION FOR THE PARTICULAR SPEECH THIS IS OF SO DEFINITE A SORT THAT IT WARRANTS SEPARATE CHAPTER TREATMENT LATER PRACTISE
5622-44585-0011 BUT PREPARATION MUST ALSO BE OF ANOTHER SORT THAN THE GATHERING ORGANIZING AND SHAPING OF MATERIALS IT MUST INCLUDE PRACTISE WHICH LIKE MENTAL PREPARATION MUST BE BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIAL
5622-44585-0012 DO NOT FEEL SURPRISED OR DISCOURAGED IF PRACTISE ON THE PRINCIPLES OF DELIVERY HEREIN LAID DOWN SEEMS TO RETARD YOUR FLUENCY FOR A TIME THIS WILL BE INEVITABLE WHILE YOU ARE WORKING FOR PROPER INFLECTION FOR INSTANCE
5622-44585-0013 INFLECTION WILL BE DEMANDING YOUR FIRST THOUGHTS AND THE FLOW OF YOUR SPEECH FOR THE TIME BEING WILL BE SECONDARY THIS WARNING HOWEVER IS STRICTLY FOR THE CLOSET FOR YOUR PRACTISE AT HOME DO NOT CARRY ANY THOUGHTS OF INFLECTION WITH YOU TO THE PLATFORM
5622-44585-0014 BUT SUBCONSCIOUSLY YOU WILL BE ATTENDING TO THE POINTS OF TECHNIQUE WHICH HAVE BECOME MORE OR LESS HABITUAL BY PRACTISE A NICE BALANCE BETWEEN THESE TWO KINDS OF ATTENTION IS IMPORTANT YOU CAN NO MORE ESCAPE THIS LAW THAN YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT AIR
5622-44585-0015 HABIT HAS ESTABLISHED THE ORDER JUST SO YOU MUST MASTER THE LAWS OF EFFICIENCY IN SPEAKING UNTIL IT IS A SECOND NATURE FOR YOU TO SPEAK CORRECTLY RATHER THAN OTHERWISE
5622-44585-0016 AND MAKE SOME CRUDE STROKES
5622-44585-0017 THE FLUENCY OF YOUR SPEECH WILL BE AT THE SPEED OF FLOW YOUR PRACTISE HAS MADE HABITUAL BUT THIS MEANS WORK WHAT GOOD HABIT DOES NOT NO PHILOSOPHER'S STONE THAT WILL ACT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR LABORIOUS PRACTISE HAS EVER BEEN FOUND IF IT WERE IT WOULD BE THROWN AWAY BECAUSE
5622-44585-0018 IT WOULD KILL OUR GREATEST JOY THE DELIGHT OF ACQUISITION IF PUBLIC SPEAKING MEANS TO YOU A FULLER LIFE YOU WILL KNOW NO GREATER HAPPINESS THAN A WELL SPOKEN SPEECH
5622-44585-0019 THE TIME YOU HAVE SPENT IN GATHERING IDEAS AND IN PRIVATE PRACTISE OF SPEAKING YOU WILL FIND AMPLY REWARDED QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES ONE WHAT ADVANTAGES HAS THE FLUENT SPEAKER OVER THE HESITATING TALKER TWO
5622-44585-0020 MACHINERY HAS CREATED A NEW ECONOMIC WORLD THE SOCIALIST PARTY IS A STRENUOUS WORKER FOR PEACE HE WAS A CRUSHED AND BROKEN MAN WHEN HE LEFT PRISON WAR MUST ULTIMATELY GIVE WAY TO WORLD WIDE ARBITRATION
5622-44585-0021 SIX PUT THE SENTIMENTS OF MISTER BRYAN'S
5622-44585-0022 SEVEN TAKE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING QUOTATIONS AND MAKE A FIVE MINUTE SPEECH ON IT WITHOUT PAUSING TO PREPARE
5622-44585-0023 THERE LIVES MORE FAITH IN HONEST DOUBT BELIEVE ME THAN IN HALF THE CREEDS TENNYSON IN MEMORIAM
5622-44585-0024 HOWE'ER IT BE IT SEEMS TO ME TIS ONLY NOBLE TO BE GOOD KIND HEARTS ARE MORE THAN CORONETS AND SIMPLE FAITH THAN NORMAN BLOOD
5622-44585-0025 CAMPBELL PLEASURES OF HOPE HIS BEST COMPANIONS INNOCENCE AND HEALTH AND HIS BEST RICHES IGNORANCE OF WEALTH GOLDSMITH THE DESERTED VILLAGE BEWARE OF DESPERATE STEPS THE DARKEST DAY LIVE TILL TOMORROW WILL HAVE PASSED AWAY
5622-44585-0026 PAINE RIGHTS OF MAN TRADE IT MAY HELP SOCIETY EXTEND
5622-44585-0027 IT MATTERS NOT HOW STRAIT THE GATE HOW CHARGED WITH PUNISHMENT THE SCROLL I AM THE MASTER OF MY FATE I AM THE CAPTAIN OF MY SOUL HENLEY INVICTUS THE WORLD IS SO FULL OF A NUMBER OF THINGS I AM SURE WE SHOULD ALL BE HAPPY AS KINGS
5622-44585-0028 MAKE A TWO MINUTE SPEECH ON ANY OF THE FOLLOWING GENERAL SUBJECTS BUT YOU WILL FIND THAT YOUR IDEAS WILL COME MORE READILY IF YOU NARROW YOUR SUBJECT BY TAKING SOME SPECIFIC PHASE OF IT
5622-44585-0029 FOR INSTANCE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO SPEAK ON LAW IN GENERAL TAKE THE PROPOSITION THE POOR MAN CANNOT AFFORD TO PROSECUTE OR INSTEAD OF DWELLING ON LEISURE SHOW HOW MODERN SPEED IS CREATING MORE LEISURE IN THIS WAY YOU MAY EXPAND THIS SUBJECT LIST INDEFINITELY
5622-44585-0030 GENERAL THEMES LAW POLITICS WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM A LARGER NAVY WAR PEACE FOREIGN IMMIGRATION THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC
5622-44585-0031 KINDNESS JUSTICE PROGRESS MACHINERY INVENTION WEALTH POVERTY

5622-44585-0033 MATRIMONY DIVORCE CHILD LABOR EDUCATION BOOKS
5622-44585-0034 LITERATURE ELECTRICITY ACHIEVEMENT FAILURE PUBLIC SPEAKING IDEALS CONVERSATION THE MOST DRAMATIC MOMENT OF MY LIFE MY HAPPIEST DAYS THINGS WORTH WHILE
5622-44585-0035 WHAT I HOPE TO ACHIEVE MY GREATEST DESIRE WHAT I WOULD DO WITH A MILLION DOLLARS IS MANKIND PROGRESSING
5622-44586-0000 A RICH CORRECTLY USED VOICE IS THE GREATEST PHYSICAL FACTOR OF PERSUASIVENESS AND POWER OFTEN OVER TOPPING THE EFFECTS OF REASON BUT A GOOD VOICE WELL HANDLED IS NOT ONLY AN EFFECTIVE POSSESSION FOR THE PROFESSIONAL SPEAKER
5622-44586-0001 IT IS A MARK OF PERSONAL CULTURE AS WELL
5622-44586-0002 GLADSTONE HIMSELF THE POSSESSOR OF A DEEP MUSICAL VOICE HAS SAID NINETY MEN IN EVERY HUNDRED IN THE CROWDED PROFESSIONS WILL PROBABLY NEVER RISE ABOVE MEDIOCRITY
5622-44586-0003 BECAUSE THE TRAINING OF THE VOICE IS ENTIRELY NEGLECTED AND CONSIDERED OF NO IMPORTANCE THESE ARE WORDS WORTH PONDERING
5622-44586-0004 ONE EASE SIGNOR BONCI OF THE METROPOLITAN OPERA COMPANY SAYS THAT THE SECRET OF GOOD VOICE IS RELAXATION AND THIS IS TRUE FOR RELAXATION IS THE BASIS OF EASE
5622-44586-0005 IN PRACTISING VOICE EXERCISES AND IN SPEAKING NEVER FORCE YOUR TONES EASE MUST BE YOUR WATCHWORD THE VOICE IS A DELICATE INSTRUMENT AND YOU MUST NOT HANDLE IT WITH HAMMER AND TONGS DON'T MAKE YOUR VOICE GO
5622-44586-0006 LET IT GO DON'T WORK LET THE YOKE OF SPEECH BE EASY AND ITS BURDEN LIGHT YOUR THROAT SHOULD BE FREE FROM STRAIN DURING SPEECH
5622-44586-0007 THE THROAT MUST ACT AS A SORT OF CHIMNEY OR FUNNEL FOR THE VOICE
5622-44586-0008 WILL NOT ONLY HARM ITS TONES BUT INJURE ITS HEALTH NERVOUSNESS AND MENTAL STRAIN ARE COMMON SOURCES OF MOUTH AND THROAT CONSTRICTION SO MAKE THE BATTLE FOR POISE AND SELF CONFIDENCE FOR WHICH WE PLEADED IN THE OPENING CHAPTER
5622-44586-0009 DO NOT FORCE YOUR HEAD AROUND SIMPLY RELAX YOUR NECK AND LET GRAVITY PULL IT AROUND AS YOUR BODY MOVES AGAIN LET YOUR HEAD FALL FORWARD ON YOUR BREAST RAISE YOUR HEAD LETTING YOUR JAW HANG RELAX UNTIL YOUR JAW FEELS HEAVY
5622-44586-0010 AS THOUGH IT WERE A WEIGHT HUNG TO YOUR FACE REMEMBER YOU MUST RELAX THE JAW TO OBTAIN COMMAND OF IT IT MUST BE FREE AND FLEXIBLE FOR THE MOULDING OF TONE AND TO LET THE TONE PASS OUT UNOBSTRUCTED
5622-44586-0011 THE LIPS ALSO MUST BE MADE FLEXIBLE TO AID IN THE MOULDING OF CLEAR AND BEAUTIFUL TONES FOR FLEXIBILITY OF LIPS REPEAT THE SYLLABLES MO ME IN SAYING MO BRING THE LIPS UP TO RESEMBLE THE SHAPE OF THE LETTER O
5622-44586-0012 IN REPEATING ME DRAW THEM BACK AS YOU DO IN A GRIN REPEAT THIS EXERCISE RAPIDLY GIVING THE LIPS AS MUCH EXERCISE AS POSSIBLE TRY THE FOLLOWING EXERCISE IN THE SAME MANNER
5622-44586-0013 AFTER THIS EXERCISE HAS BEEN MASTERED THE FOLLOWING WILL ALSO BE FOUND EXCELLENT FOR FLEXIBILITY OF LIPS MEMORIZE THESE SOUNDS INDICATED NOT THE EXPRESSIONS SO THAT YOU CAN REPEAT THEM RAPIDLY
5622-44586-0014 A AS IN MAY E AS IN MET U AS IN USE A
5622-44586-0015 YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT ALL THE ACTIVITY THEN CENTERS AROUND THE DIAPHRAGM THIS IS THE NATURAL AND CORRECT METHOD OF BREATHING BY CONSTANT WATCHFULNESS MAKE THIS YOUR HABITUAL MANNER
5622-44586-0016 IF THE MUSCLES OF THE THROAT ARE CONSTRICTED THE TONE PASSAGE PARTIALLY CLOSED AND THE MOUTH KEPT HALF SHUT HOW CAN YOU EXPECT THE TONE TO COME OUT BRIGHT AND CLEAR OR EVEN TO COME OUT AT ALL SOUND IS A SERIES OF WAVES AND IF YOU MAKE A PRISON OF YOUR MOUTH
5622-44586-0017 HOLDING THE JAWS AND LIPS RIGIDLY IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE TONE TO SQUEEZE THROUGH
5622-44586-0018 OPEN YOUR MOUTH WIDE RELAX ALL THE ORGANS OF SPEECH AND LET THE TONE FLOW OUT EASILY START TO YAWN BUT INSTEAD OF YAWNING SPEAK WHILE YOUR THROAT IS OPEN MAKE THIS OPEN FEELING HABITUAL WHEN SPEAKING
5622-44586-0019 WE SAY MAKE BECAUSE IT IS A MATTER OF RESOLUTION AND OF PRACTISE IF YOUR VOCAL ORGANS ARE HEALTHY YOUR TONE PASSAGES MAY BE PARTLY CLOSED BY ENLARGED TONSILS ADENOIDS OR ENLARGED TURBINATE BONES OF THE NOSE
5622-44586-0020 IF SO A SKILLED PHYSICIAN SHOULD BE CONSULTED THE NOSE IS AN IMPORTANT TONE PASSAGE AND SHOULD BE KEPT OPEN AND FREE FOR PERFECT TONES WHAT WE CALL TALKING THROUGH THE NOSE IS NOT TALKING THROUGH THE NOSE
5622-44586-0021 AS YOU CAN EASILY DEMONSTRATE BY HOLDING YOUR NOSE AS YOU TALK IF YOU ARE BOTHERED WITH NASAL TONES CAUSED BY GROWTHS OR SWELLINGS IN THE NASAL PASSAGES A SLIGHT PAINLESS OPERATION WILL REMOVE THE OBSTRUCTION THIS IS QUITE IMPORTANT
5622-44586-0022 SOMBRE AND UNATTRACTIVE THE TONE MUST BE PITCHED FORWARD BUT DO NOT FORCE IT FORWARD YOU WILL RECALL THAT OUR FIRST PRINCIPLE WAS EASE THINK THE TONE FORWARD AND OUT BELIEVE IT IS GOING FORWARD AND ALLOW IT TO FLOW EASILY
5622-44586-0023 YOU CAN TELL WHETHER YOU ARE PLACING YOUR TONE FORWARD OR NOT BY INHALING A DEEP BREATH AND SINGING AH WITH THE MOUTH WIDE OPEN TRYING TO FEEL THE LITTLE DELICATE SOUND WAVES STRIKE THE BONY ARCH OF THE MOUTH JUST ABOVE THE FRONT TEETH
5622-44586-0024 THE SENSATION IS SO SLIGHT THAT YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT BE ABLE TO DETECT IT AT ONCE BUT PERSEVERE IN YOUR PRACTISE ALWAYS THINKING THE TONE FORWARD AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED BY FEELING YOUR VOICE STRIKE THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH
5622-44586-0025 A CORRECT FORWARD PLACING OF THE TONE WILL DO AWAY WITH THE DARK THROATY TONES THAT ARE SO UNPLEASANT INEFFICIENT AND HARMFUL TO THE THROAT CLOSE THE LIPS
5622-44586-0026 THINK THE TONE FORWARD DO YOU FEEL IT STRIKE THE LIPS HOLD THE PALM OF YOUR HAND IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE AND SAY VIGOROUSLY CRASH DASH WHIRL BUZZ CAN YOU FEEL THE FORWARD TONES STRIKE AGAINST YOUR HAND PRACTISE UNTIL YOU CAN
5622-44586-0027 REMEMBER THE ONLY WAY TO GET YOUR VOICE FORWARD IS TO PUT IT FORWARD HOW TO DEVELOP THE CARRYING POWER OF THE VOICE IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SPEAK LOUDLY IN ORDER TO BE HEARD AT A DISTANCE IT IS NECESSARY ONLY TO SPEAK CORRECTLY
5622-44586-0028 REMEMBER TO APPLY THE PRINCIPLES OF EASE OPENNESS AND FORWARDNESS THEY ARE THE PRIME FACTORS IN ENABLING YOUR VOICE TO BE HEARD AT A DISTANCE DO NOT GAZE AT THE FLOOR AS YOU TALK THIS HABIT NOT ONLY GIVES THE SPEAKER AN AMATEURISH APPEARANCE
5622-44586-0029 BUT IF THE HEAD IS HUNG FORWARD THE VOICE WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE GROUND INSTEAD OF FLOATING OUT OVER THE AUDIENCE VOICE IS A SERIES OF AIR VIBRATIONS TO STRENGTHEN IT TWO THINGS ARE NECESSARY MORE AIR OR BREATH AND MORE VIBRATION
5622-44586-0030 USUALLY ILL HEALTH MEANS A WEAK VOICE WHILE ABUNDANT PHYSICAL VITALITY IS SHOWN THROUGH A STRONG VIBRANT VOICE THEREFORE ANYTHING THAT IMPROVES THE GENERAL VITALITY IS AN EXCELLENT VOICE STRENGTHENER PROVIDED YOU USE THE VOICE PROPERLY
5622-44586-0031 AND DEVELOPED LUNG POWER A HARD FOUGHT BASKETBALL OR TENNIS GAME IS AN EFFICIENT WAY OF PRACTISING DEEP BREATHING WHEN THESE METHODS ARE NOT CONVENIENT WE RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING PLACE YOUR HANDS AT YOUR SIDES ON THE WAIST LINE
5622-44586-0032 BY TRYING TO ENCOMPASS YOUR WAIST WITH YOUR FINGERS AND THUMBS FORCE ALL THE AIR OUT OF THE LUNGS TAKE A DEEP BREATH REMEMBER ALL THE ACTIVITY IS TO BE CENTERED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY
5622-44586-0033 REPEAT THE EXERCISE PLACING YOUR HANDS ON THE SMALL OF THE BACK AND FORCING THEM OUT AS YOU INHALE MANY METHODS FOR DEEP BREATHING HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY VARIOUS AUTHORITIES GET THE AIR INTO YOUR LUNGS THAT IS THE IMPORTANT THING
5622-44586-0034 AFTER A LITTLE PRACTISE THEY WILL VIBRATE GIVING A TICKLING SENSATION REPEAT THIS EXERCISE THROWING THE HUMMING SOUND INTO THE NOSE HOLD THE UPPER PART OF THE NOSE BETWEEN THE THUMB AND FOREFINGER CAN YOU FEEL THE NOSE VIBRATE
5622-44586-0035 PLACING THE PALM OF YOUR HAND ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD REPEAT THIS HUMMING EXERCISE THINK THE VOICE THERE AS YOU HUM IN HEAD TONES CAN YOU FEEL THE VIBRATION THERE NOW PLACE THE PALM OF YOUR HAND ON THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD REPEATING THE FOREGOING PROCESS
5622-44586-0036 THEN TRY IT ON THE CHEST ALWAYS REMEMBER TO THINK YOUR TONE WHERE YOU DESIRE TO FEEL THE VIBRATIONS THE MERE ACT OF THINKING ABOUT ANY PORTION OF YOUR BODY WILL TEND TO MAKE IT VIBRATE
5622-44586-0037 ENDEAVORING TO FEEL ALL PORTIONS OF YOUR BODY VIBRATE AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU HAVE ATTAINED THIS YOU WILL FIND THAT IT IS A PLEASANT SENSATION WHAT HO MY JOVIAL MATES COME ON WE WILL FROLIC IT LIKE FAIRIES FRISKING IN THE MERRY MOONSHINE
5622-44586-0038 PURITY OF VOICE THIS QUALITY IS SOMETIMES DESTROYED BY WASTING THE BREATH CAREFULLY CONTROL THE BREATH USING ONLY AS MUCH AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF TONE UTILIZE ALL THAT YOU GIVE OUT
5622-44586-0039 FAILURE TO DO THIS RESULTS IN A BREATHY TONE TAKE IN BREATH LIKE A PRODIGAL IN SPEAKING GIVE IT OUT LIKE A MISER VOICE SUGGESTIONS NEVER ATTEMPT TO FORCE YOUR VOICE WHEN HOARSE DO NOT DRINK COLD WATER WHEN SPEAKING
5622-44586-0040 THE SUDDEN SHOCK TO THE HEATED ORGANS OF SPEECH WILL INJURE THE VOICE AVOID PITCHING YOUR VOICE TOO HIGH IT WILL MAKE IT RASPY THIS IS A COMMON FAULT
5622-44586-0041 A WIDE RANGE WILL GIVE YOU FACILITY IN MAKING NUMEROUS CHANGES OF PITCH DO NOT FORM THE HABIT OF LISTENING TO YOUR VOICE WHEN SPEAKING YOU WILL NEED YOUR BRAIN TO THINK OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING RESERVE YOUR OBSERVATION FOR PRIVATE PRACTISE
5622-44586-0042 GIVE SOME EXERCISES FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THESE CONDITIONS FOUR WHY IS RANGE OF VOICE DESIRABLE FIVE TELL HOW RANGE OF VOICE MAY BE CULTIVATED SIX
5622-44586-0043 HOW MUCH DAILY PRACTISE DO YOU CONSIDER NECESSARY FOR THE PROPER DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR VOICE SEVEN HOW CAN RESONANCE AND CARRYING POWER BE DEVELOPED EIGHT WHAT ARE YOUR VOICE FAULTS
5940-54016-0000 WISDOM'S WAGES AND FOLLY'S PAY ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A WISE MAN OF WISE MEN AND A GREAT MAGICIAN TO BOOT AND HIS NAME WAS DOCTOR SIMON AGRICOLA ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A SIMPLETON OF SIMPLETONS AND A GREAT BOOBY TO BOOT
5940-54016-0001 AND HIS NAME WAS BABO SIMON AGRICOLA HAD READ ALL THE BOOKS WRITTEN BY MAN AND COULD DO MORE MAGIC THAN ANY CONJURER THAT EVER LIVED BUT NEVERTHELESS HE WAS NONE TOO WELL OFF IN THE WORLD
5940-54016-0002 BABO GATHERED RUSHES FOR A CHAIR MAKER AND HE ALSO HAD TOO FEW OF THE GOOD THINGS TO MAKE LIFE EASY BUT IT IS NOTHING OUT OF THE WAY FOR A SIMPLETON TO BE IN THAT CASE THE TWO OF THEM LIVED NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR THE ONE IN THE NEXT HOUSE TO THE OTHER
5940-54016-0003 AND SO FAR AS THE WORLD COULD SEE THERE WAS NOT A PIN TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM ONLY THAT ONE WAS CALLED A WISE MAN AND THE OTHER A SIMPLETON ONE DAY THE WEATHER WAS COLD AND WHEN BABO CAME HOME FROM GATHERING RUSHES HE FOUND NO FIRE IN THE HOUSE

5940-54016-0008 SAID SIMON AGRICOLA THEN LISTEN TO MORROW I AM GOING OUT INTO THE WORLD TO MAKE MY FORTUNE FOR LITTLE OR NOTHING IS TO BE HAD IN THIS TOWN IF YOU WILL GO ALONG WITH ME I WILL MAKE YOUR FORTUNE ALSO
5940-54016-0009 VERY WELL SAID BABO AND THE BARGAIN WAS STRUCK SO THE NEXT MORNING BRIGHT AND EARLY OFF THEY STARTED UPON THEIR JOURNEY CHEEK BY JOWL THE WISE MAN AND THE SIMPLETON TO MAKE THEIR FORTUNES IN THE WIDE WORLD
5940-54016-0010 THEY WILL BE OF USE BY AND BY AND AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP A GREAT STONE AS BIG AS HIS TWO FISTS AND DROPPED IT INTO THE POUCH THAT DANGLED AT HIS SIDE NOT I SAID BABO I WILL CARRY NO STONE WITH ME
5940-54016-0011 WITH BABO AT HIS HEELS AT LAST THEY CAME TO A GREAT WIDE PLAIN WHERE FAR OR NEAR NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT BARE SAND WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A PEBBLE OR A SINGLE BLADE OF GRASS AND THERE NIGHT CAUGHT UP WITH THEM
5940-54016-0012 DEAR DEAR BUT I AM HUNGRY SAID BABO SO AM I SAID SIMON AGRICOLA LET'S SIT DOWN HERE AND EAT SO DOWN THEY SAT AND SIMON AGRICOLA OPENED HIS POUCH AND DREW FORTH THE STONE THE STONE IT

5940-54016-0014 AS FOR THE WISE MAN HE FINISHED HIS LOAF OF BREAD TO THE LAST CRUMB
5940-54016-0015 THE NEXT MORNING OFF THEY STARTED AGAIN BRIGHT AND EARLY AND BEFORE LONG THEY CAME TO JUST SUCH ANOTHER FIELD OF STONES AS THEY LEFT BEHIND THEM THE DAY BEFORE COME MASTER SAID BABO
5940-54016-0016 LET US EACH TAKE A STONE WITH US WE MAY NEED SOMETHING MORE TO EAT BEFORE THE DAY IS OVER NO SAID SIMON AGRICOLA WE WILL NEED NO STONES TO DAY
5940-54016-0017 BUT THE SWEAT RAN DOWN BABO'S FACE LIKE DROPS ON THE WINDOW IN AN APRIL SHOWER AT LAST THEY CAME TO A GREAT WIDE PLAIN WHERE NEITHER STOCK NOR STONE WAS TO BE SEEN BUT ONLY A GALLOWS TREE UPON WHICH ONE POOR
5940-54016-0018 WIGHT HUNG DANCING UPON NOTHING AT ALL AND THERE NIGHT CAUGHT THEM AGAIN AHA SAID BABO TO HIMSELF THIS TIME I SHALL HAVE BREAD AND MY MASTER NONE BUT LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENED
5940-54016-0019 UP STEPPED THE WISE MAN TO THE GALLOWS AND GAVE IT A SHARP RAP WITH HIS STAFF THEN LO AND BEHOLD THE GALLOWS WAS GONE AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A FINE INN WITH LIGHTS IN THE WINDOWS
5940-54016-0020 AND THE SMELL OF GOOD THINGS COOKING FILLING THE AIR ALL AROUND SO THAT ONLY TO SNIFF DID ONE'S HEART GOOD POOR BABO LET FALL THE STONE HE HAD CARRIED ALL DAY A STONE IT WAS AND A STONE HE LET FALL BORN A FOOL LIVE A FOOL

5940-54016-0026 SAID THE OLD NOBLEMAN MAKE ME YOUNG AND YOU SHALL HAVE THEM AND WELCOME SO SIMON AGRICOLA GAVE THE WORD AND BABO BLEW THE BELLOWS UNTIL THE FIRE BLAZED AND ROARED THEN THE DOCTOR CAUGHT THE OLD NOBLEMAN AND LAID HIM UPON THE FORGE
5940-54016-0027 HE HEAPED THE COALS OVER HIM AND TURNED HIM THIS WAY AND THAT UNTIL HE GREW RED HOT LIKE A PIECE OF IRON THEN HE DREW HIM FORTH FROM THE FIRE AND DIPPED HIM IN THE WATER TANK PHIZZ THE WATER HISSED AND THE STEAM ROSE UP IN A CLOUD
5940-54016-0028 AND WHEN SIMON AGRICOLA TOOK THE OLD NOBLEMAN OUT LO AND BEHOLD HE WAS AS FRESH AND BLOOMING AND LUSTY AS A LAD OF TWENTY BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW ALL THE PEOPLE STARED AND GOGGLED BABO AND THE BLACKSMITH AND THE NOBLEMAN'S SERVANTS

5940-54016-0030 WITH HIS SERVANTS AT HIS HEELS AND THAT WAS ALL THE GOOD THAT SIMON AGRICOLA HAD OF THIS TRICK BUT ILL LUCK WAS NOT DONE WITH HIM YET FOR WHEN THE SMITH SAW HOW MATTERS HAD TURNED OUT
5940-54016-0031 HAD PAID HIM THE GOLDEN ANGEL HE HAD PROMISED FOR THE USE OF THE FORGE THE DOCTOR PULLED A SOUR FACE BUT ALL THE SAME HE HAD TO PAY THE ANGEL THEN THE SMITH LET HIM GO AND OFF HE MARCHED IN A HUFF

5940-54016-0047 HE JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND AWAY HE SCAMPERED WITH THE COOK AT HIS HEELS WELL THE UPSHOT OF THE BUSINESS WAS THAT SIMON AGRICOLA HAD TO GO BACK AND BRING LIFE TO THE WOMAN AGAIN OR THE COOK WOULD THUMP HIM AND BABO BOTH WITH THE ROLLING PIN AND WHAT WAS MORE

5940-54016-0054 HE KNEW NOT WHITHER NIGHT CAUGHT HIM AND HE LAY DOWN UNDER A HEDGE TO SLEEP THERE HE LAY AND SNORED AWAY LIKE A SAW MILL FOR HE WAS WEARIED WITH HIS LONG JOURNEYING NOW IT CHANCED THAT THAT SAME NIGHT TWO THIEVES HAD BROKEN INTO A MISER'S HOUSE
5940-54016-0055 AND HAD STOLEN AN IRON POT FULL OF GOLD MONEY DAY BROKE BEFORE THEY REACHED HOME SO DOWN THEY SAT TO CONSIDER THE MATTER AND THE PLACE WHERE THEY SEATED THEMSELVES WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE WHERE BABO LAY THE OLDER THIEF WAS FOR CARRYING THE MONEY HOME UNDER HIS COAT
5940-54016-0056 THE YOUNGER WAS FOR BURYING IT UNTIL NIGHT HAD COME AGAIN THEY SQUABBLED AND BICKERED AND ARGUED TILL THE NOISE THEY MADE WAKENED BABO AND HE SAT UP THE FIRST THING HE THOUGHT OF WAS THE ADVICE THAT THE DOCTOR HAD GIVEN HIM THE EVENING BEFORE THINK WELL HE BAWLED OUT
5940-54016-0057 THINK WELL BEFORE YOU DO WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO DO THINK WELL WHEN THE TWO THIEVES HEARD BABO'S PIECE OF ADVICE THEY THOUGHT THAT THE JUDGE'S OFFICERS WERE AFTER THEM FOR SURE AND CERTAIN
5940-54016-0058 DOWN THEY DROPPED THE POT OF MONEY AND AWAY THEY SCAMPERED AS FAST AS THEIR LEGS COULD CARRY THEM BABO HEARD THEM RUNNING AND POKED HIS HEAD THROUGH THE HEDGE AND THERE LAY THE POT OF GOLD LOOK NOW SAID HE THIS HAS COME FROM THE ADVICE THAT WAS GIVEN ME
5940-54016-0059 NO ONE EVER GAVE ME ADVICE THAT WAS WORTH SO MUCH BEFORE
5940-54016-0060 HOW DID YOU GET IT SAID THEY I GOT IT FOR A PIECE OF ADVICE SAID BABO FOR A PIECE OF ADVICE NO NO THE KING'S OFFICERS KNEW BUTTER FROM LARD AND TRUTH FROM T'OTHER THING IT WAS JUST THE SAME IN THAT COUNTRY AS IT IS IN OUR TOWN
5940-54016-0061 THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD SO CHEAP AS ADVICE WHOEVER HEARD OF ANYBODY GIVING A POT OF GOLD AND SILVER MONEY FOR IT WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD THEY MARCHED BABO AND HIS POT OF MONEY OFF TO THE KING COME SAID THE KING TELL ME TRULY WHERE DID YOU GET THE POT OF MONEY

5940-54016-0063 THAT IS A BARGAIN AND SO HE LENT THE KING HIS PIECE OF ADVICE FOR ONE DAY ON TRIAL NOW THE CHIEF COUNCILLOR AND SOME OTHERS HAD LAID A PLOT AGAINST THE KING'S LIFE AND THAT MORNING IT HAD BEEN SETTLED THAT WHEN THE BARBER SHAVED HIM HE WAS TO CUT HIS THROAT WITH A RAZOR
5940-54016-0064 SO AFTER THE BARBER HAD LATHERED HIS FACE HE BEGAN TO WHET THE RAZOR AND TO WHET THE RAZOR JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE KING REMEMBERED BABO'S PIECE OF ADVICE THINK WELL SAID HE THINK WELL BEFORE YOU DO WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO DO THINK WELL
5940-54016-0065 WHEN THE BARBER HEARD THE WORDS THAT THE KING SAID HE THOUGHT THAT ALL HAD BEEN DISCOVERED DOWN HE FELL UPON HIS KNEES AND CONFESSED EVERYTHING THAT IS HOW BABO'S ADVICE SAVED THE KING'S LIFE YOU CAN GUESS WHETHER THE KING THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH MUCH OR LITTLE
5940-54016-0066 WHEN BABO CAME THE NEXT MORNING THE KING GAVE HIM TEN CHESTS FULL OF MONEY AND THAT MADE THE SIMPLETON RICHER THAN ANYBODY IN ALL THAT LAND HE BUILT HIMSELF A FINE HOUSE
5940-54016-0067 AND ALL WERE GLAD TO STOP AND CHAT AWHILE WITH HIM WHEN THEY MET HIM IN THE STREET ONE MORNING BABO LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND WHO SHOULD HE SEE COME TRAVELLING ALONG THE ROAD BUT SIMON AGRICOLA HIMSELF AND HE WAS JUST AS POOR AND DUSTY AND TRAVEL STAINED AS EVER
5940-54016-0068 COME IN COME IN SAID BABO AND YOU CAN GUESS HOW THE WISE MAN STARED WHEN HE SAW THE SIMPLETON LIVING IN SUCH A FINE WAY BUT HE OPENED HIS EYES WIDER THAN EVER WHEN HE HEARD THAT ALL THESE GOOD THINGS CAME FROM THE PIECE OF ADVICE

5940-54016-0073 I HAD SAT LISTENING TO THESE JOLLY FOLK FOR ALL THIS TIME AND I HAD NOT HEARD OLD SINDBAD SAY A WORD AND YET I KNEW VERY WELL HE WAS FULL OF A STORY FOR EVERY NOW AND THEN I COULD SEE HIS LIPS MOVE

5940-54613-0000 BLUE BEARD THERE WAS A MAN WHO HAD FINE HOUSES BOTH IN TOWN AND COUNTRY A DEAL OF SILVER AND GOLD PLATE EMBROIDERED FURNITURE AND COACHES GILDED ALL OVER WITH GOLD
5940-54613-0001 BUT THIS MAN HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO HAVE A BLUE BEARD WHICH MADE HIM SO FRIGHTFULLY UGLY THAT ALL THE WOMEN AND GIRLS RAN AWAY FROM HIM ONE OF HIS NEIGHBOURS A LADY OF QUALITY HAD TWO DAUGHTERS WHO WERE PERFECT BEAUTIES
5940-54613-0002 HE DESIRED OF HER ONE OF THEM IN MARRIAGE LEAVING TO HER THE CHOICE WHICH OF THE TWO SHE WOULD BESTOW UPON HIM THEY WOULD NEITHER OF THEM HAVE HIM AND EACH MADE THE OTHER WELCOME OF HIM BEING NOT ABLE TO BEAR THE THOUGHT OF MARRYING A MAN WHO HAD A BLUE BEARD
5940-54613-0003 AND WHAT BESIDES GAVE THEM DISGUST AND AVERSION WAS HIS HAVING ALREADY BEEN MARRIED TO SEVERAL WIVES AND NOBODY EVER KNEW WHAT BECAME OF THEM BLUE BEARD TO ENGAGE THEIR AFFECTION TOOK THEM WITH THE LADY THEIR MOTHER
5940-54613-0004 AND FEASTING NOBODY WENT TO BED BUT ALL PASSED THE NIGHT IN PLAYING TRICKS UPON EACH OTHER IN SHORT EVERY THING SUCCEEDED SO WELL THAT THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER BEGAN TO THINK THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE NOT TO HAVE A BEARD SO VERY BLUE

5940-54613-0010 BECAUSE OF THE IMPATIENCE SHE HAD TO GO AND OPEN THE CLOSET
5940-54613-0011 SHE WAS SO MUCH PRESSED BY HER CURIOSITY THAT WITHOUT CONSIDERING THAT IT WAS VERY UNCIVIL TO LEAVE HER COMPANY SHE WENT DOWN A LITTLE BACK STAIR CASE AND WITH SUCH EXCESSIVE HASTE THAT SHE HAD TWICE OR THRICE LIKE TO HAVE BROKEN HER NECK
5940-54613-0012 BUT COULD NOT AT FIRST SEE ANY THING PLAINLY BECAUSE THE WINDOWS WERE SHUT AFTER SOME MOMENTS SHE BEGAN TO PERCEIVE THAT THE FLOOR WAS ALL COVERED OVER WITH CLOTTED BLOOD IN WHICH WERE REFLECTED THE BODIES OF SEVERAL DEAD WOMEN RANGED AGAINST THE WALLS
5940-54613-0013 THESE WERE ALL THE WIVES WHOM BLUE BEARD HAD MARRIED AND MURDERED ONE AFTER ANOTHER SHE WAS LIKE TO HAVE DIED FOR FEAR AND THE KEY WHICH SHE PULLED OUT OF THE LOCK FELL OUT OF HER HAND AFTER HAVING SOMEWHAT RECOVERED HER SENSES SHE TOOK UP THE KEY

5940-54613-0030 SO THAT HE RAN AWAY IMMEDIATELY TO SAVE HIMSELF BUT THE TWO BROTHERS PURSUED SO CLOSE THAT THEY OVERTOOK HIM BEFORE HE COULD GET TO THE STEPS OF THE PORCH WHEN THEY RAN THEIR SWORDS THRO HIS BODY AND LEFT HIM DEAD THE POOR WIFE WAS ALMOST AS DEAD AS HER HUSBAND
5940-54613-0031 AND HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO RISE AND WELCOME HER BROTHERS BLUE BEARD HAD NO HEIRS AND SO HIS WIFE BECAME MISTRESS OF ALL HIS ESTATE SHE MADE USE OF ONE PART OF IT TO MARRY HER SISTER ANNE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO HAD LOVED HER A LONG WHILE

5968-55202-0016 NOW BERTRAM'S VOICE WAS ALMOST SAVAGE OH NO HE ISN'T GOING TO LIVE HERE NOW INTERPOSED SMOOTH TONES FROM THE DOORWAY MISTER
5968-55202-0017 BREATHED BILLY CONFUSEDLY THREE CRIMSON FACED MEN SPRANG TO THEIR FEET THE SITUATION FOR A MOMENT THREATENED EMBARRASSED MISERY FOR ALL CONCERNED BUT ARKWRIGHT WITH A CHEERY SMILE ADVANCED STRAIGHT TOWARD BERTRAM AND HELD OUT A FRIENDLY HAND
5968-55202-0018 HE HEREBY ASKS EVERYBODY'S PARDON FOR THE ANNOYANCE HIS LITTLE JOKE HAS CAUSED HE MIGHT ADD THAT HE'S HEARTILY ASHAMED OF HIMSELF AS WELL BUT IF ANY OF YOU ARKWRIGHT TURNED TO THE THREE TALL MEN STILL STANDING BY THEIR CHAIRS
5968-55202-0019 IF ANY OF YOU HAD SUFFERED WHAT HE HAS AT THE HANDS OF A SWARM OF YOUNGSTERS FOR THAT NAME'S SAKE YOU WOULDN'T BLAME HIM FOR BEING TEMPTED TO GET WHAT FUN HE COULD OUT OF MARY JANE IF THERE EVER CAME A CHANCE NATURALLY AFTER THIS THERE COULD BE NOTHING STIFF OR EMBARRASSING
5968-55202-0020 BILLY LAUGHED IN RELIEF AND MOTIONED MISTER ARKWRIGHT TO A SEAT NEAR HER WILLIAM SAID OF COURSE OF COURSE AND SHOOK HANDS AGAIN BERTRAM AND CYRIL LAUGHED SHAMEFACEDLY AND SAT DOWN SOMEBODY SAID
5968-55202-0021 BUT WHAT DOES THE M J STAND FOR ANYHOW NOBODY ANSWERED THIS HOWEVER PERHAPS BECAUSE AUNT HANNAH AND MARIE APPEARED JUST THEN IN THE DOORWAY DINNER PROVED TO BE A LIVELY MEAL IN THE NEWCOMER BERTRAM MET HIS MATCH FOR WIT AND SATIRE
5968-55202-0022 HE TURNED TO A BOOKCASE NEAR HIM AND BEGAN TO TAKE DOWN AND EXAMINE SOME OF THE BOOKS BERTRAM TWINKLED AND GLANCED AT BILLY WHICH IS IT CYRIL HE CALLED WITH CHEERFUL IMPERTINENCE STOOL PIANO OR AUDIENCE THAT IS THE MATTER TO NIGHT
5968-55202-0023 NONSENSE SCORNED CYRIL DROPPING HIS BOOK AND WALKING BACK TO HIS CHAIR I DON'T FEEL LIKE PLAYING TO NIGHT THAT'S ALL YOU SEE NODDED BERTRAM AGAIN I SEE BOWED ARKWRIGHT WITH QUIET AMUSEMENT I BELIEVE
5968-55202-0024 HE WAS COMING TO BOSTON FOR TO STUDY MUSIC EVERYBODY LAUGHED WON'T YOU SING PLEASE ASKED BILLY CAN YOU WITHOUT YOUR NOTES I HAVE LOTS OF SONGS IF YOU WANT THEM FOR A MOMENT
5968-55202-0025 BUT ONLY A MOMENT ARKWRIGHT HESITATED THEN HE ROSE AND WENT TO THE PIANO WITH THE EASY SURENESS OF THE TRAINED MUSICIAN HIS FINGERS DROPPED TO THE KEYS AND SLID INTO PRELIMINARY CHORDS AND ARPEGGIOS TO TEST THE TOUCH OF THE PIANO
5968-55202-0026 THEN WITH A SWEETNESS AND PURITY THAT MADE EVERY LISTENER TURN IN AMAZED DELIGHT A WELL TRAINED TENOR BEGAN THE THRO THE LEAVES THE NIGHT WINDS MOVING OF SCHUBERT'S SERENADE
5968-55202-0027 CYRIL'S CHIN HAD LIFTED AT THE FIRST TONE HE WAS LISTENING NOW WITH VERY OBVIOUS PLEASURE BERTRAM TOO WAS SHOWING BY HIS ATTITUDE THE KEENEST APPRECIATION WILLIAM AND AUNT HANNAH RESTING BACK IN THEIR CHAIRS
5968-55202-0028 WERE CONTENTEDLY NODDING THEIR APPROVAL TO EACH OTHER MARIE IN HER CORNER WAS MOTIONLESS WITH RAPTURE AS TO BILLY BILLY WAS PLAINLY OBLIVIOUS OF EVERYTHING BUT THE SONG AND THE SINGER SHE SEEMED SCARCELY TO MOVE OR TO BREATHE TILL THE SONG'S COMPLETION
5968-55202-0029 I WISH I COULD SING LIKE THAT I WISH I COULD PAINT A FACE OF A GIRL SMILED THE TENOR AS HE TURNED FROM THE PIANO OH BUT MISTER ARKWRIGHT DON'T STOP OBJECTED BILLY SPRINGING TO HER FEET AND GOING TO HER MUSIC CABINET BY THE PIANO
5968-55202-0030 WILLIAM AND AUNT HANNAH STILL SMILED CONTENTEDLY IN THEIR CHAIRS THOUGH AUNT HANNAH HAD REACHED FOR THE PINK SHAWL NEAR HER THE MUSIC HAD SENT LITTLE SHIVERS DOWN HER SPINE CYRIL WITH MARIE HAD SLIPPED INTO THE LITTLE RECEPTION ROOM ACROSS THE HALL
5968-55202-0031 OSTENSIBLY TO LOOK AT SOME PLANS FOR A HOUSE ALTHOUGH AS EVERYBODY KNEW THEY WERE NOT INTENDING TO BUILD FOR A YEAR BERTRAM STILL SITTING STIFFLY ERECT IN HIS CHAIR WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF A VAGUE IRRITATION NOW
5968-55202-0032 HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A VERY REAL AND A VERY DECIDED ONE AN IRRITATION THAT WAS DIRECTED AGAINST HIMSELF AGAINST BILLY AND AGAINST THIS MAN ARKWRIGHT BUT CHIEFLY AGAINST MUSIC PER SE HE HATED MUSIC
5968-55202-0033 HE WISHED HE COULD SING HE WONDERED HOW LONG IT TOOK TO TEACH A MAN TO SING ANYHOW AND HE WONDERED IF A MAN COULD SING WHO NEVER HAD SUNG AT THIS POINT THE DUET CAME TO AN END AND BILLY AND HER GUEST LEFT THE PIANO ALMOST AT ONCE AFTER THIS
5968-55202-0034 ARKWRIGHT MADE HIS VERY GRACEFUL ADIEUS AND WENT OFF WITH HIS SUIT CASE TO THE HOTEL WHERE AS HE HAD INFORMED AUNT HANNAH HIS ROOM WAS ALREADY ENGAGED WILLIAM WENT HOME THEN AND AUNT HANNAH WENT UP STAIRS
5968-55202-0035 CYRIL AND MARIE WITHDREW INTO A STILL MORE SECLUDED CORNER TO LOOK AT THEIR PLANS AND BERTRAM FOUND HIMSELF AT LAST ALONE WITH BILLY HE FORGOT THEN IN THE BLISSFUL HOUR HE SPENT WITH HER BEFORE THE OPEN FIRE HOW HE HATED MUSIC
5968-61356-0000 HUGH AND HIS COMPANIONS STOOD BY THE DOOR OF THE DINING HALL ON WENT THE DANCE AND THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE THICK WITH TOBACCO SMOKE THE NATIVE WOMEN WERE GUIDED THEIR BRONZED FACES SPEAKING EXCITEMENT COME ON IN GENTLEMEN THE WALLS OF THE ROOM WERE LINED WITH MEN
5968-61356-0001 SQUAWS WHO HAD NOT YET LEARNED THE DANCE SAT ON BOXES THE THREE FRIENDS CROWDED INTO THE ROOM AND STOOD WITH THEIR BACKS AGAINST THE WALL FRANK CORTE WAS BEATING TIME WITH HIS FOOT AND CLAPPING HIS HANDS WHILE HE SANG THE CALLS IN A WEIRD DRAWL HONOURS TO THE RIGHT
5968-61356-0002 EACH MAN BOWED MOST GRAVELY TO HIS PARTNER WHO MOST RESPECTFULLY RETURNED IT HONOURS TO THE LEFT
5968-61356-0003 AND THE SQUAWS WERE SO EXCITED THEY SEEMED TO OCCUPY MORE ROOM THAN REALLY THEY DID
5968-61356-0005 THE MEN FACING OUTWARDS THE WOMEN INWARDS ON TO THE NEXT THE MEN WHEELED AND WITH THEIR LADIES PIVOTED TO THE LEFT THEN THE MEN TOOK THE HAND OF THE LADIES NEXT ON THEIR RIGHT AS THEY SWUNG ROUND THE LADIES HOLDING THE MEN BY THE LEFT GAVE THEIR RIGHT HAND
5968-61356-0006 THE LADIES OUTWARDS ON THE NEXT AGAIN BROUGHT THE MEN FACING OUTWARDS THE LADIES INWARDS AND SO ON THE QUADRILLE WAS CONCLUDED WITH PROMENADE ALL AROUND THE HALL AND SEAT YOUR LADIES AT THE BALL THE FACES OF THE CROWD WERE WILD WITH EXCITEMENT
5968-61356-0007 THE MUSIC WAS WEIRD AND DISCORDANT YET JOHN FOUND IT ALL VERY STIMULATING DANCE AFTER DANCE WAS GONE THROUGH WHILE HE STAYED AND WATCHED TILL THERE CAME TO HIS MIND PICTURES OF THE OLD HOME HIS FATHER'S HOUSE IN LONDON AND ALICE PEEL WAS SHE THINKING OF HIM
5968-61356-0008 SAY WHY DON'T YOU FELLOWS GET IN AND DANCE DREAMS AND FANCIES WERE REFT AWAY AS REALITY IN THE PERSON OF HASKINS OF THE SAW PITS STOOD BEFORE JOHN BERWICK
5968-61356-0009 A BEGINNER IN THE DANCE HIS HILARITY PROVOKED THE SQUAW AND AS THE DANCE PAUSED FOR A SECOND BETWEEN HER GASPS AND THROUGH HER PERSPIRATION SHE HISSED WITH A LOOK OF CONTEMPT CHE CHAC KA SAY YOU FELLOWS WILL HAVE TO GET IN AND DANCE IN THIS NEXT SET
5968-61356-0010 I SAW A SQUAW LOOKING AT YOU AND SAYING HEAP DAM DOOD
5968-61356-0011 HASKINS WAS AGAIN WORRYING THEM ALL RIGHT WHO WILL I ASK TO DANCE GEORGE WAS READY GO AND ASK THAT SQUAW SITTING IN THE CORNER SAID HASKINS POINTING ACROSS THE ROOM SHE IT WAS WHO HAD SAID HEAP DAM DOOD GEORGE WENT AND INVITED HER TO BE HIS PARTNER
5968-61356-0012 NI KA HALO INTRODUX YOU HAVE NOT BEEN INTRODUCED SHE ANSWERED THIS WAS MORE THAN GEORGE COULD WITHSTAND IN GRAVITY
5968-61356-0013 HE ONLY GUESSED THE MEANING OF THE WORDS SO HE REPEATED THEM TO HASKINS WHO THE DEVIL HAS TAUGHT THESE SAVAGES UP HERE CHINOOK IT'S A SPECIAL LINGO MANUFACTURED BY THE HUDSON BAY COMPANY TO SUIT THE SAVAGES AND WHEN WHITE MEN FIRST CAME INTO BRITISH COLUMBIA
5968-61356-0014 THEY FOUND THE SAVAGES WITH A LINGO WHICH WAS CALLED WHITE MAN'S WA WA AND WHICH NO PERSON COULD UNDERSTAND
5968-61356-0015 THE SIWASH CALLS AN ENGLISHMAN KING GEORGE MAN AND AN AMERICAN BOSTON MAN THE SQUAW IN THE CORNER WAS KEEPING HER EYE ON GEORGE WITH EVIDENT DISLIKE AS JOHN NOTICED THIS HE RECOMMENDED THEIR DEPARTURE SO GEORGE AND HE WENT BACK TO BED
5968-61356-0016 JOHN LOOKED UP AND SAW THE SMILING FACE OF FRANK AT HIS KITCHEN DOOR
5968-61356-0017 AND REALIZED THAT FRANK WAS SOMETHING OF A CONUNDRUM CORTE WHO WAS KNEADING BREAD TOOK A SEAT ON A BOX BY THE KITCHEN DOOR SAY DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THIS COUNTRY IF UNCLE SAM WAS REALLY TO COME OVER AND TAKE IT I HOPE NOT WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH IT AS IT IS
5968-61356-0018 TOO MUCH POLICE TOO MUCH LAW AND ORDER YOU CAN NEVER HAVE A REAL LIVE MINING CAMP IN CANADA THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD DANCE YOU HAD FRIDAY NIGHT YES IT WAS ALL RIGHT
5968-61356-0019 BUT SAY THAT WAS A GOOD ONE WHEN THE SQUAW TOLD THE OTHER KING GEORGE MAN HE HAD NOT BEEN INTRODUCED TO HER FRANK CHUCKLED AND THEN AS THE PROSPECT OF AN INTERNATIONAL ARGUMENT DID NOT SEEM GOOD WENT ON ANOTHER TACK DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS A GOD
5968-61356-0020 A FLOOD OF MEMORIES SURGED THROUGH BERWICK'S BRAIN HE GLANCED AT THE DARK SINISTER FEATURES OF THE MAN AWAITING HIS REPLY AND THEN LOOKED AT THE SUNLIGHT SHOULD HE GIVE SUCH AN ANSWER IN SUCH A TONE AS WOULD DISCOURAGE FURTHER ARGUMENT NO THE QUESTION WAS TOO SERIOUS
5968-61356-0021 HE MIGHT NOT HAVE FELT CALLED UPON AT ONE TIME TO DIVULGE HIS BELIEF WHICH IN THE PAST HAD BEEN A BURDEN OF MUCH QUESTIONING BUT HERE IT WAS ASKED PERHAPS IN LEVITY BY ONE WHO EVIDENTLY COULD NOT FULLY BELIEVE HE FELT CALLED UPON TO ANSWER YES I DO
5968-61356-0022 REALIZING THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH BERWICK REGARDED THE QUESTION HE FEARED LEST HE HAD HURT THE FEELINGS OF HIS GUEST THE ANSWER HE RECEIVED REASSURED HIM REMOVING HIS BIG ARMS FROM THE DOUGH AND GESTICULATING HE ANSWERED WELL PARTNER I DON'T NOW HERE'S THE PROPOSITION
5968-61356-0023 THOSE WHO SAY THERE IS A GOD SAY WHAT HE SET OUT TO DO THE FIRST THING GOD DONE WAS TO BUILD THE WORLD AND AFTER HE DONE THIS
5968-61356-0024 AND THEN HE PUTS ADAM AND EVE INTO IT AFTER HAVING MADE THEM HE TELLS THEM NOT TO EAT APPLES AND THEN HE GOES AND HAS A SNAKE WHICH TELLS THEM TO EAT APPLES AND BECAUSE THEY DO EAT APPLES HE PULLS UP THE RANCH AND KICKS THEM OUT
5968-61356-0025 BUT HE BRINGS ALL SORTS OF DISEASES AND PAINS ON EARTH THAT'S WHAT KEEPS ME FROM BELIEVING IN GOD NOW LOOK HERE IF GOD WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE EARTH AND THE STARS AND EVERYTHING WHY SHOULD HE NOT MAKE MAN AND LET HIM ENJOY ALL THIS SEEING THAT HE IS DOING IT ALL MORE OR LESS FOR AMUSEMENT
5968-61356-0026 WITHOUT PUTTING HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF A LOT OF GOOD THINGS AND THEN PUTTING UP A JOB ON HIM I'VE TALKED TO PARSONS ON THIS THING AND SOME OF THEM SAYS THAT AFTER HE BUST UP THE HOME RANCH HE KIND OF GOT SORRY AND SAYS HE WOULD SEND HIS SON ON EARTH TO DIE
5968-61356-0027 TO FIX UP THE BIG MISTAKE ADAM AND EVE MADE IN EATING ONE APPLE NOW SAY IF YOU WAS DOING ALL THIS WOULD YOU AFTER YOU MADE MAN AND PUT HIM ON THE EARTH AND HE DID WRONG WOULD YOU SEND YOUR SON TO FIX THINGS UP SO THAT THE CROWD WOULD GO AND NAIL HIM TO A BIG WOODEN CROSS
5968-61356-0028 BY DRIVING BIG STAKES THROUGH HIS HANDS AND FEET AND THEN STICK HIM UP FOR THE CROWS TO PECK AT IF GOD WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE A MAN THE FIRST GO OFF WHO WOULD STAND A MILL TEST WHY DID HE NOT KILL HIM OFF BODY AND SOUL
5968-61356-0029 AND TRY AGAIN WITHOUT TRYING TO FIX THINGS UP BY MAKING HIS SON SUFFER THE WHOLE PROPOSITION AIN'T NATURAL AND WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A MAN WHO IF HE FELL DOWN ON ANY PROPOSITION WOULD MAKE HIS SON GO AND SUFFER TO FIX UP HIS MISTAKES WHY DID HE NOT COME ON EARTH AND DIE ON THE CROSS HIMSELF
5968-61356-0030 AND SUFFER AND TURN THE EARTH AND ALL THE STARS AND THE REST OF IT OVER TO HIS SON TO RUN WHILE HE WAS GONE JOHN BERWICK WAS NOT BY NATURE ARGUMENTATIVE HAVING SELDOM IN HIS LIFE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE DRAWN INTO ANY BUT POLITICAL CONTROVERSY HE HAD IT IS TRUE
5968-61356-0031 DISCUSSED DOCTRINE AT COLLEGE WITH HIS CLASS MATES HE HAD READ MUCH PHILOSOPHY AND HAD PONDERED DEEPLY ON THE MYSTERY OF HUMAN SUFFERING THE DEEPEST OF ALL MYSTERIES HE HAD WEIGHED THE ARGUMENTS OF GREAT MINDS WHICH WANTED BELIEF IN GOD AND IN HIS OWN MIND
5968-61356-0032 HAD DONE MUCH TO SURMOUNT THE DIFFICULTY TO JUSTIFY THE WAYS OF GOD TO MAN BUT THE CRUDE INTELLECT BEFORE HIM HAD LAUNCHED FORTH A PROPOSITION HE COULD NOT CONFUTE HIS TRAINING IN RHETORIC AND IN THE DRAWING OF PARALLELS WAS OF USE ONLY AGAINST THE CULTURED MIND
5968-61356-0033 THE LEGEND OF THE SAXON KING DRAWING THE SIMILE OF LIFE FROM THE LITTLE BIRD WHICH FLEW WITHIN THE HALL FIRELIGHT AND WAS GONE AGAIN CAME TO HIS MIND BUT HE PUT IT ASIDE AS IMPOTENT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY HE SAID NOTHING FRANK CORTE WAS WORKING AT HIS BREAD AGAIN
5968-61356-0034 HIS FACE TWITCHING WITH A SMILE AND THEN THERE'S MISKITIES AND BLACK FLIES AND MOOSE FLIES AND BULL DOGS SAY WAIT A MONTH OR TWO TILL THE MISKITIES GET BUSY AND THEN TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW ANY GREAT AND GOOD GOD WOULD PUT SUCH THINGS ON EARTH
5968-61356-0035 WHY SHOULD GOD BECAUSE MAN WENT AND EAT AN APPLE MAKE ANIMALS SUFFER IN TRYING TO GET EVEN FRANK CORTE RETURNED TO THE KNEADING WHILE JOHN BERWICK THOUGHTFULLY WATCHED THE SUN FLOODED LANDSCAPE FRANK HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE
5968-61356-0036 THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING IS THE EATING I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANY ARGUMENT QUITE LIKE YOURS BUT MAN'S COMING TO THE WORLD HOW HE CAME TO THE WORLD AND WHETHER HE HAS A SOUL HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST SUBJECTS OF STUDY THROUGH THE AGES WE KNOW THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
5968-61356-0037 WAS TAUGHT BACK TO WITHIN A FEW YEARS OF THE TIME CHRIST CAME ON EARTH AND FROM THAT TIME ON HAS GOT BIGGER IN POWER AND INFLUENCE OVER THE MINDS OF MEN SO THAT THE MAJORITY OF CIVILIZED PEOPLE GIVE JUSTICE TO THEIR FELLOWS BECAUSE THIS RELIGION TELLS THEM TO DO SO THE BIBLE
5968-61356-0038 TELLS A STORY OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN WHICH WE MAY OR MAY NOT BELIEVE THE BIBLE SAYS THERE IS A GOD AND GOD SEES BEST NOT TO EXPLAIN HIS SCHEMES AND WHY HE MAKES MAN AND ANIMALS SUFFER I BELIEVE THERE IS A GOD
5968-61356-0039 WHY NOT TRY TO BELIEVE THERE IS A GOD RATHER THAN ARGUE WITH YOURSELF AND OTHERS THAT THERE IS NO GOD IF THE CHRISTIAN BELIEF HAS MADE THE WORLD SO MUCH BETTER AS A WHOLE IT WILL MAKE YOU AND ME BETTER AS SINGLE MEN AND I KNOW YOU WOULD GIVE A MAN A MEAL IF HE WANTED IT
5968-61356-0040 OR IF A FELLOW WERE SICK YOU WOULD HELP HIM OUT ALL YOU COULD AND YOU'D EXPECT ME TO DO THE SAME IF YOU SAW A FELLOW DROWNING IN THE RIVER YOU'D HELP HIM OUT BUT THE CHINAMAN WHO IS NOT A CHRISTIAN WOULD LET HIM DROWN YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN ALL RIGHT BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IT
5968-61356-0041 THOUGH I DIDN'T LIKE TO SAY IT SERIOUS LIKE BUT THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD TALK OF YOURS AND SURE SOUNDS NATURAL SAY IS THAT OTHER KING GEORGE MAN WITH YOU AS GOOD A FELLOW AS YOU ARE SAY YOU'VE SET ME THINKING
5968-71320-0000 TOOK HIS DEPARTURE FROM GRAY FOREST LEAVING POOR RHODA TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF HER GUILTY STEPMOTHER AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SEEN SO LITTLE OF HER FATHER YET THE VERY CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS PRESENCE HAD GIVEN HER A CERTAIN CONFIDENCE AND SENSE OF SECURITY WHICH VANISHED AT THE MOMENT OF HIS DEPARTURE
5968-71320-0001 FEAR STRICKEN AND WRETCHED AS HE HAD BEEN HIS REMOVAL NEVERTHELESS SEEMED TO HER TO RENDER THE LONELY AND INAUSPICIOUS MANSION STILL MORE DESOLATE AND OMINOUS THAN BEFORE SHE HAD WITH A VAGUE AND INSTINCTIVE ANTIPATHY
5968-71320-0002 AVOIDED ALL CONTACT AND INTERCOURSE WITH MISSUS MARSTON OR AS FOR DISTINCTNESS SAKE WE SHALL CONTINUE TO CALL HER MADEMOISELLE SINCE HER RETURN
5968-71320-0003 WE MUST NOW FOLLOW MISTER MARSTON IN HIS SOLITARY EXPEDITION TO CHESTER WHEN HE TOOK HIS PLACE IN THE STAGECOACH HE HAD THE WHOLE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE TO HIMSELF AND THUS CONTINUED TO BE ITS SOLITARY OCCUPANT FOR SEVERAL MILES THE COACH HOWEVER WAS EVENTUALLY HAILED
5968-71320-0004 BROUGHT TO AND THE DOOR BEING OPENED DOCTOR DANVERS GOT IN AND TOOK HIS PLACE OPPOSITE TO THE PASSENGER ALREADY ESTABLISHED THERE THE WORTHY MAN WAS SO BUSIED IN DIRECTING THE DISPOSITION OF HIS LUGGAGE FROM THE WINDOW AND IN ARRANGING THE SUNDRY SMALL PARCELS WITH WHICH HE WAS CHARGED
5968-71320-0005 THAT HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIS COMPANION UNTIL THEY WERE IN MOTION WHEN HE DID SO IT WAS WITH NO VERY PLEASURABLE FEELING AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT MARSTON TOO WOULD HAVE GLADLY ESCAPED THE COINCIDENCE WHICH THUS REDUCED THEM ONCE MORE TO THE TEMPORARY NECESSITY OF A TATE A TATE
5968-71320-0006 EMBARRASSING AS EACH FELT THE SITUATION TO BE THERE WAS HOWEVER NO AVOIDING IT AND AFTER A RECOGNITION AND A FEW FORCED ATTEMPTS AT CONVERSATION THEY BECAME BY MUTUAL CONSENT SILENT AND UNCOMMUNICATIVE THE JOURNEY THOUGH IN POINT OF SPACE A MERE TRIFLE
5968-71320-0007 DOCTOR DANVERS I HAVE BEEN FIFTY TIMES ON THE POINT OF SPEAKING TO YOU CONFIDENTIALLY OF COURSE WHILE SITTING HERE OPPOSITE TO YOU WHAT I BELIEVE I COULD SCARCELY BRING MYSELF TO HINT TO ANY OTHER MAN LIVING YET I MUST TELL IT AND SOON TOO OR I FEAR IT WILL HAVE TOLD ITSELF
5968-71320-0008 DOCTOR DANVERS INTIMATED HIS READINESS TO HEAR AND ADVISE IF DESIRED AND MARSTON RESUMED ABRUPTLY AFTER A PAUSE PRAY DOCTOR DANVERS HAVE YOU HEARD ANY STORIES OF AN ODD KIND ANY SURMISES
5968-71320-0009 I DON'T MEAN OF A MORAL SORT FOR THOSE I HOLD VERY CHEAP TO MY PREJUDICE INDEED I SHOULD HARDLY SAY TO MY PREJUDICE I MEAN I OUGHT TO SAY IN SHORT HAVE YOU HEARD PEOPLE REMARK UPON ANY FANCIED ECCENTRICITIES OR THAT SORT OF THING ABOUT ME
5968-71320-0010 HE PUT THE QUESTION WITH OBVIOUS DIFFICULTY AND AT LAST SEEMED TO OVERCOME HIS OWN RELUCTANCE WITH A SORT OF ANGRY AND EXCITED SELF CONTEMPT AND IMPATIENCE DOCTOR DANVERS WAS A LITTLE PUZZLED BY THE INTERROGATORY AND ADMITTED IN REPLY
5968-71320-0011 BUT OF THE IMMORTAL TENANT OF THIS BODY MY MIND SIR IS BEGINNING TO PLAY ME TRICKS MY GUIDE MOCKS AND TERRIFIES ME THERE WAS A PERCEPTIBLE TINGE OF HORROR IN THE LOOK OF ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH DOCTOR DANVERS LISTENED YOU ARE A GENTLEMAN SIR
5968-71320-0012 AND A CHRISTIAN CLERGYMAN WHAT I HAVE SAID AND SHALL SAY IS CONFIDED TO YOUR HONOR TO BE HELD SACRED AS THE CONFESSION OF MISERY AND HIDDEN FROM THE COARSE GAZE OF THE WORLD I HAVE BECOME SUBJECT TO A HIDEOUS DELUSION IT COMES AT INTERVALS I DO NOT THINK ANY MORTAL SUSPECTS IT
5968-71320-0013 MARSTON PAUSED HE WAS STOOPED FORWARD AND LOOKING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE VEHICLE SO THAT HIS COMPANION COULD NOT SEE HIS COUNTENANCE A SILENCE ENSUED WHICH WAS INTERRUPTED BY MARSTON WHO ONCE MORE RESUMED SIR SAID HE
5968-71320-0014 I KNOW NOT WHY BUT I HAVE LONGED INTENSELY LONGED FOR SOME TRUSTWORTHY EAR INTO WHICH TO POUR THIS HORRID SECRET WHY I REPEAT I CANNOT TELL FOR I EXPECT NO SYMPATHY AND HATE COMPASSION IT IS I SUPPOSE THE RESTLESS NATURE OF THE DEVIL THAT IS IN ME BUT BE IT WHAT IT MAY
5968-71320-0015 FOR THE PRESENT AT LEAST TO YOU ALONE DOCTOR DANVERS AGAIN ASSURED HIM THAT HE MIGHT REPOSE THE MOST ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN HIS SECRECY THE HUMAN MIND I TAKE IT MUST HAVE EITHER COMFORT IN THE PAST OR HOPE IN THE FUTURE HE CONTINUED OTHERWISE IT IS IN DANGER
5968-71320-0016 TO ME SIR THE PAST IS INTOLERABLY REPULSIVE ONE BOUNDLESS BARREN AND HIDEOUS GOLGOTHA OF DEAD HOPES AND MURDERED OPPORTUNITIES THE FUTURE STILL BLACKER AND MORE FURIOUS PEOPLED WITH DREADFUL FEATURES OF HORROR AND MENACE
5968-71320-0017 AND LOSING ITSELF IN UTTER DARKNESS SIR I DO NOT EXAGGERATE BETWEEN SUCH A PAST AND SUCH A FUTURE I STAND UPON THIS MISERABLE PRESENT
5968-71320-0018 NO SIR THERE IS NO COMFORT FROM THAT QUARTER EITHER SAID MARSTON BITTERLY YOU BUT CAST YOUR SEEDS AS THE PARABLE TERMS YOUR TEACHING UPON THE BARREN SEA IN WASTING THEM ON ME MY FATE BE IT WHAT IT MAY IS AS IRREVOCABLY FIXED AS THOUGH I WERE DEAD AND JUDGED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
5968-71320-0019 THAT OCCURRENCE ABOUT WYNSTON BERKLEY HE IS THE HERO OF THE HELLISH ILLUSION AT CERTAIN TIMES SIR IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF HE THOUGH DEAD WERE STILL INVESTED WITH A SORT OF SPURIOUS LIFE GOING ABOUT UNRECOGNIZED EXCEPT BY ME IN SQUALOR AND CONTEMPT
5968-71320-0020 AND WHISPERING AWAY MY FAME AND LIFE LABORING WITH THE MALIGNANT INDUSTRY OF A FIEND TO INVOLVE ME IN THE MESHES OF THAT SPECIAL PERDITION FROM WHICH ALONE I SHRINK
5968-71320-0021 SIR THIS IS A MONSTROUS AND HIDEOUS EXTRAVAGANCE A DELUSION BUT AFTER ALL NO MORE THAN A TRICK OF THE IMAGINATION THE REASON THE JUDGMENT IS UNTOUCHED I CANNOT CHOOSE BUT SEE ALL THE DAMNED PHANTASMAGORIA BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT REAL
5968-71320-0022 AND THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY CASE AND AND MADNESS THEY WERE NOW ENTERING THE SUBURBS OF CHESTER AND DOCTOR DANVERS PAINED AND SHOCKED BEYOND MEASURE BY THIS UNLOOKED FOR DISCLOSURE AND NOT KNOWING WHAT REMARK OR COMFORT TO OFFER

6235-36641-0004 I HAVEN'T LET THE NAUTILUS PULL TOO NEAR THE COAST AND WE'RE FAIRLY WELL OUT
6235-36641-0005 BUT I HAVE THE SKIFF READY AND IT WILL TAKE US TO THE EXACT SPOT WHERE WE'LL DISEMBARK WHICH WILL SAVE US A PRETTY LONG TREK IT'S CARRYING OUR DIVING EQUIPMENT
6235-36641-0006 CAPTAIN NEMO TOOK ME TO THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY WHOSE STEPS LED TO THE PLATFORM NED AND CONSEIL WERE THERE
6235-36641-0007 OARS IN POSITION FIVE OF THE NAUTILUS'S SAILORS WERE WAITING FOR US ABOARD THE SKIFF WHICH WAS MOORED ALONGSIDE THE NIGHT WAS STILL DARK LAYERS OF CLOUDS CLOAKED THE SKY AND LEFT ONLY A FEW STARS IN VIEW
6235-36641-0008 COVERING THREE QUARTERS OF THE HORIZON FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHWEST GOING UP CEYLON'S WEST COAST DURING THE NIGHT THE NAUTILUS LAY WEST OF THE BAY
6235-36641-0009 UNDER THESE DARK WATERS THERE STRETCHED THE BANK OF SHELLFISH AN INEXHAUSTIBLE FIELD OF PEARLS MORE THAN TWENTY MILES LONG
6235-36641-0010 FOUND SEATS IN THE STERN OF THE SKIFF THE LONGBOAT'S COXSWAIN TOOK THE TILLER
6235-36641-0011 AND WE PULLED CLEAR THE SKIFF HEADED SOUTHWARD THE OARSMEN TOOK THEIR TIME I WATCHED THEIR STROKES VIGOROUSLY CATCH THE WATER AND THEY ALWAYS WAITED TEN SECONDS BEFORE ROWING AGAIN
6235-36641-0012 FOLLOWING THE PRACTICE USED IN MOST NAVIES WHILE THE LONGBOAT COASTED DROPS OF LIQUID FLICKED FROM THE OARS AND HIT THE DARK TROUGHS OF THE WAVES PITTER PATTERING LIKE SPLASHES OF MOLTEN LEAD
6235-36641-0013 COMING FROM WELL OUT A MILD SWELL MADE THE SKIFF ROLL GENTLY AND A FEW CRESTING BILLOWS LAPPED AT ITS BOW WE WERE SILENT WHAT WAS CAPTAIN NEMO THINKING
6235-36641-0014 CONTRARY TO THE CANADIAN'S VIEWS IN WHICH IT STILL SEEMED TOO FAR AWAY AS FOR CONSEIL HE HAD COME ALONG OUT OF SIMPLE CURIOSITY
6235-36641-0015 DEFINED THE UPPER LINES OF THE COAST WITH GREATER DISTINCTNESS FAIRLY FLAT TO THE EAST IT SWELLED A LITTLE TOWARD THE SOUTH
6235-36641-0016 BETWEEN US AND THE SHORE THE SEA WAS DESERTED NOT A BOAT NOT A DIVER PROFOUND SOLITUDE REIGNED OVER THIS GATHERING PLACE OF PEARL FISHERMEN AS CAPTAIN NEMO HAD COMMENTED
6235-36641-0017 A MONTH TOO SOON AT SIX O'CLOCK THE DAY BROKE SUDDENLY WITH THAT SPEED UNIQUE TO TROPICAL REGIONS
6235-36641-0018 THE SUN'S RAYS PIERCED THE CLOUD CURTAIN GATHERED ON THE EASTERLY HORIZON AND THE RADIANT ORB ROSE SWIFTLY I COULD CLEARLY SEE THE SHORE WHICH FEATURED A FEW SPARSE TREES HERE AND THERE
6235-36641-0019 THE SKIFF ADVANCED TOWARD MANNAR ISLAND WHICH CURVED TO THE SOUTH CAPTAIN NEMO STOOD UP FROM HIS THWART AND STUDIED THE SEA AT HIS SIGNAL THE ANCHOR WAS LOWERED
6235-36641-0020 BUT ITS CHAIN BARELY RAN BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LAY NO MORE THAN A METER DOWN AND THIS LOCALITY WAS ONE OF THE SHALLOWEST SPOTS
6235-36641-0021 YOU OBSERVE THIS CONFINED BAY A MONTH FROM NOW IN THIS VERY PLACE THE NUMEROUS FISHING BOATS OF THE HARVESTERS WILL GATHER AND THESE ARE THE WATERS THEIR DIVERS WILL RANSACK SO DARINGLY THIS
6235-36641-0022 BAY IS FELICITOUSLY LAID OUT FOR THEIR TYPE OF FISHING IT'S SHELTERED FROM THE STRONGEST WINDS AND THE SEA IS NEVER VERY TURBULENT HERE HIGHLY FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR DIVING WORK NOW LET'S PUT ON OUR UNDERWATER SUITS
6235-36641-0023 AND WE'LL BEGIN OUR STROLL I DIDN'T REPLY AND WHILE STARING AT THESE SUSPICIOUS WAVES I BEGAN TO PUT ON MY HEAVY AQUATIC CLOTHES HELPED BY THE LONGBOAT'S SAILORS
6235-36641-0024 NONE OF THE NAUTILUS'S MEN WERE TO GO WITH US ON THIS NEW EXCURSION
6235-36641-0025 AS FOR THE RUHMKORFF DEVICE IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE IN THE PICTURE BEFORE INSERTING MY HEAD INTO ITS COPPER CAPSULE I COMMENTED ON THIS TO THE CAPTAIN OUR LIGHTING EQUIPMENT WOULD BE USELESS TO US THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED ME
6235-36641-0026 WE WON'T BE GOING VERY DEEP AND THE SUN'S RAYS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO LIGHT OUR WAY BESIDES IT'S UNWISE TO CARRY ELECTRIC LANTERNS UNDER THESE WAVES
6235-36641-0027 THEIR BRIGHTNESS MIGHT UNEXPECTEDLY ATTRACT CERTAIN DANGEROUS OCCUPANTS OF THESE WATERWAYS AS CAPTAIN NEMO PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS I TURNED TO CONSEIL AND NED LAND
6235-36641-0028 BUT MY TWO FRIENDS HAD ALREADY ENCASED THEIR CRANIUMS IN THEIR METAL HEADGEAR AND THEY COULD NEITHER HEAR NOR REPLY
6235-36641-0029 WHAT ABOUT OUR WEAPONS I ASKED HIM OUR RIFLES RIFLES WHAT FOR DON'T YOUR MOUNTAINEERS ATTACK BEARS DAGGER IN HAND AND ISN'T STEEL SURER THAN LEAD HERE'S A STURDY BLADE SLIP IT UNDER YOUR BELT AND LET'S BE OFF
6235-36641-0030 I STARED AT MY COMPANIONS THEY WERE ARMED IN THE SAME FASHION
6235-36641-0031 THEN FOLLOWING THE CAPTAIN'S EXAMPLE I LET MYSELF BE CROWNED WITH MY HEAVY COPPER SPHERE AND OUR AIR TANKS IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO ACTION AN INSTANT LATER THE LONGBOAT'S SAILORS HELPED US OVERBOARD ONE AFTER THE OTHER
6235-36641-0032 AND WE SET FOOT ON LEVEL SAND IN A METER AND A HALF OF WATER
6235-36641-0033 WE FOLLOWED HIM DOWN A GENTLE SLOPE AND DISAPPEARED UNDER THE WAVES THERE THE OBSESSIVE FEARS IN MY BRAIN LEFT ME I BECAME SURPRISINGLY CALM AGAIN THE EASE WITH WHICH I COULD MOVE INCREASED MY CONFIDENCE
6235-36641-0034 AND THE MANY STRANGE SIGHTS CAPTIVATED MY IMAGINATION THE SUN WAS ALREADY SENDING SUFFICIENT LIGHT UNDER THESE WAVES THE TINIEST OBJECTS REMAINED VISIBLE AFTER TEN MINUTES OF WALKING
6235-36641-0035 WE WERE IN FIVE METERS OF WATER AND THE TERRAIN HAD BECOME ALMOST FLAT
6235-36641-0036 THERE ROSE UNDERFOOT SCHOOLS OF UNUSUAL FISH FROM THE GENUS MONOPTERUS WHOSE MEMBERS HAVE NO FIN
6235-36641-0037 A GENUINE EIGHT DECIMETER SERPENT WITH A BLUISH GRAY BELLY WHICH WITHOUT THE GOLD LINES OVER ITS FLANKS COULD EASILY BE CONFUSED WITH THE CONGER EEL FROM THE BUTTERFISH GENUS WHOSE OVAL BODIES ARE VERY FLAT
6235-36641-0038 EDIBLE FISH THAT WHEN DRIED AND MARINATED MAKE AN EXCELLENT DISH KNOWN BY THE NAME
6235-36641-0039 THEN SOME SEA POACHERS FISH BELONGING TO THE GENUS
6235-36641-0040 WHOSE BODIES ARE COVERED WITH SCALY ARMOR DIVIDED INTO EIGHT LENGTHWISE SECTIONS MEANWHILE AS THE SUN GOT PROGRESSIVELY HIGHER IT LIT UP THE WATERY MASS MORE AND MORE THE SEAFLOOR CHANGED LITTLE BY LITTLE
6235-36641-0041 AMONG OTHER SPECIMENS IN THESE TWO BRANCHES I NOTED SOME WINDOWPANE OYSTERS WITH THIN VALVES OF UNEQUAL SIZE A TYPE OF OSTRACOD
6235-36641-0042 WITH CIRCULAR SHELLS AWL SHAPED AUGER SHELLS
6235-36641-0043 WITH SUCH WONDERFUL DYE SPIKY PERIWINKLES FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS LONG THAT ROSE UNDER THE WAVES LIKE HANDS READY TO GRAB YOU TURBAN SNAILS WITH SHELLS MADE OF HORN
6235-36641-0044 LAMP SHELLS EDIBLE DUCK CLAMS THAT FEED THE HINDU MARKETPLACE SUBTLY LUMINOUS JELLYFISH
6235-36641-0045 AND FINALLY SOME WONDERFUL OCULINA FLABELLIFORMA MAGNIFICENT SEA FANS THAT
6235-36641-0046 IN THE MIDST OF THIS MOVING VEGETATION UNDER ARBORS OF WATER PLANTS THERE RACED LEGIONS OF CLUMSY ARTICULATES IN PARTICULAR SOME FANGED FROG CRABS
6235-36641-0047 SLIGHTLY ROUNDED TRIANGLE ROBBER CRABS EXCLUSIVE TO THESE WATERWAYS AND HORRIBLE PARTHENOPE CRABS WHOSE APPEARANCE WAS REPULSIVE TO THE EYE ONE ANIMAL NO LESS HIDEOUS WHICH I ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL TIMES
6235-36641-0048 HERE UNDER THESE CLEAR WAVES THIS CRAB RACED AROUND WITH MATCHLESS AGILITY WHILE GREEN TURTLES FROM THE SPECIES FREQUENTING THE MALABAR COAST MOVED SLUGGISHLY AMONG THE CRUMBLING ROCKS
6235-36641-0049 NEAR SEVEN O'CLOCK WE FINALLY SURVEYED THE BANK OF SHELLFISH WHERE PEARL OYSTERS REPRODUCE BY THE MILLIONS
6235-36641-0050 THAT WOMB FOR PEARLS WHOSE VALVES ARE NEARLY EQUAL IN SIZE HAS THE SHAPE OF A ROUND SHELL WITH THICK WALLS
6235-36641-0051 SOME OF THESE SHELLS WERE FURROWED WITH FLAKY GREENISH BANDS THAT RADIATED DOWN FROM THE TOP THESE WERE THE YOUNG OYSTERS THE OTHERS HAD RUGGED BLACK SURFACES MEASURED UP TO FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS IN WIDTH
6235-36641-0052 AND WERE TEN OR MORE YEARS OLD
6235-36641-0053 WERE GENUINELY INEXHAUSTIBLE SINCE NATURE'S CREATIVE POWERS ARE GREATER THAN MAN'S DESTRUCTIVE INSTINCTS TRUE TO THOSE INSTINCTS NED LAND GREEDILY STUFFED THE FINEST OF THESE MOLLUSKS
6235-36641-0054 INTO A NET HE CARRIED AT HIS SIDE BUT WE COULDN'T STOP WE HAD TO FOLLOW THE CAPTAIN
6235-36641-0055 AND WHEN I LIFTED MY ARMS SOMETIMES THEY WOULD PASS ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE SEA THEN THE LEVEL OF THE OYSTERBANK WOULD LOWER UNPREDICTABLY OFTEN WE WENT AROUND TALL POINTED ROCKS RISING LIKE PYRAMIDS
6235-36641-0056 AIMING THEIR LONG LEGS LIKE HEAVY ARTILLERY WATCHED US WITH UNBLINKING EYES WHILE UNDERFOOT THERE CREPT MILLIPEDES BLOODWORMS
6235-36641-0057 WHOSE ANTENNAS AND TUBULAR TENTACLES WERE INCREDIBLY LONG JUST THEN A HUGE CAVE OPENED UP IN OUR PATH HOLLOWED FROM A PICTURESQUE PILE OF ROCKS WHOSE SMOOTH HEIGHTS WERE COMPLETELY HUNG WITH UNDERWATER FLORA
6235-36641-0058 AT FIRST THIS CAVE LOOKED PITCH BLACK TO ME INSIDE THE SUN'S RAYS SEEMED TO DIMINISH BY DEGREES THEIR HAZY TRANSPARENCY WAS NOTHING MORE THAN DROWNED LIGHT CAPTAIN NEMO WENT IN WE FOLLOWED HIM
6235-36641-0059 I DISTINGUISHED THE UNPREDICTABLY CONTOURED SPRINGINGS OF A VAULT SUPPORTED BY NATURAL PILLARS FIRMLY BASED ON A GRANITE FOUNDATION LIKE THE WEIGHTY COLUMNS OF TUSCAN ARCHITECTURE WHY HAD OUR INCOMPREHENSIBLE GUIDE
6235-36641-0060 I WOULD SOON FIND OUT AFTER GOING DOWN A FAIRLY STEEP SLOPE OUR FEET TROD THE FLOOR OF A SORT OF CIRCULAR PIT
6235-36641-0061 A HOLY WATER FONT THAT COULD HAVE HELD A WHOLE LAKE A BASIN MORE THAN TWO METERS WIDE HENCE EVEN BIGGER THAN THE ONE ADORNING THE NAUTILUS'S LOUNGE
6235-36641-0062 I APPROACHED THIS PHENOMENAL MOLLUSK ITS MASS OF FILAMENTS ATTACHED IT TO A TABLE OF GRANITE
6235-36641-0063 I ESTIMATED THE WEIGHT OF THIS GIANT CLAM AT THREE HUNDRED KILOGRAMS HENCE SUCH AN OYSTER HELD FIFTEEN KILOS OF MEAT AND YOU'D NEED THE STOMACH OF KING GARGANTUA TO EAT A COUPLE DOZEN
6235-36641-0064 AND I THOUGHT HIS SOLE REASON FOR LEADING US TO THIS LOCALITY
6235-36641-0065 ON THE CURRENT CONDITION OF THIS GIANT CLAM THE MOLLUSK'S TWO VALVES WERE PARTLY OPEN
6235-36641-0066 THEN WITH HIS HANDS HE RAISED THE FRINGED MEMBRANE FILLED TUNIC THAT MADE UP THE ANIMAL'S MANTLE THERE
6235-36641-0067 I SAW A LOOSE PEARL AS BIG AS A COCONUT ITS GLOBULAR SHAPE PERFECT CLARITY AND WONDERFUL ORIENT
6235-36641-0068 CARRIED AWAY BY CURIOSITY I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND TO TAKE IT WEIGH IT FONDLE IT BUT THE CAPTAIN STOPPED ME SIGNALED NO REMOVED HIS DAGGER IN ONE SWIFT MOTION
6235-36641-0069 HE ALLOWED IT TO GROW IMPERCEPTIBLY WITH EACH PASSING YEAR THE MOLLUSK'S SECRETIONS ADDED NEW CONCENTRIC LAYERS THE CAPTAIN ALONE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE CAVE WHERE THIS WONDERFUL FRUIT OF NATURE WAS RIPENING
6235-36641-0070 HE ALONE REARED IT SO TO SPEAK IN ORDER TO TRANSFER IT ONE DAY TO HIS DEARLY BELOVED MUSEUM PERHAPS FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLES OF OYSTER FARMERS IN CHINA AND INDIA HE HAD EVEN PREDETERMINED THE CREATION OF THIS PEARL
6235-36641-0071 BY STICKING UNDER THE MOLLUSK'S FOLDS SOME PIECE OF GLASS OR METAL THAT WAS GRADUALLY COVERED WITH MOTHER OF PEARL IN ANY CASE COMPARING THIS PEARL TO OTHERS I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT
6235-36641-0072 AND TO THOSE SHIMMERING IN THE CAPTAIN'S COLLECTION I ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS WORTH AT LEAST TEN MILLION FRANCS IT WAS A SUPERB NATURAL CURIOSITY RATHER THAN A LUXURIOUS PIECE OF JEWELRY
6235-36641-0073 BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY FEMALE EAR THAT COULD HANDLE IT OUR VISIT TO THIS OPULENT GIANT CLAM CAME TO AN END
6235-36641-0074 NOT YET DISTURBED BY DIVERS AT WORK WE WALKED BY OURSELVES GENUINE LOITERERS STOPPING OR STRAYING AS OUR FANCIES DICTATED FOR MY PART I WAS NO LONGER WORRIED ABOUT THOSE DANGERS MY IMAGINATION HAD SO RIDICULOUSLY EXAGGERATED
6235-36641-0075 THE SHALLOWS DREW NOTICEABLY CLOSER TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND SOON WALKING IN ONLY A METER OF WATER MY HEAD PASSED WELL ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE OCEAN CONSEIL REJOINED ME
6235-36641-0076 AND GLUING HIS HUGE COPPER CAPSULE TO MINE HIS EYES GAVE ME A FRIENDLY GREETING BUT THIS LOFTY PLATEAU MEASURED ONLY A FEW FATHOMS AND SOON WE REENTERED OUR ELEMENT I THINK I'VE NOW EARNED THE RIGHT TO DUB IT THAT TEN MINUTES LATER
6235-36641-0077 NO WITH A GESTURE HE ORDERED US TO CROUCH BESIDE HIM AT THE FOOT OF A WIDE CREVICE
6235-36641-0078 FIVE METERS AWAY A SHADOW APPEARED AND DROPPED TO THE SEAFLOOR THE ALARMING IDEA OF SHARKS CROSSED MY MIND BUT I WAS MISTAKEN
6235-36641-0079 IT WAS A MAN A LIVING MAN A BLACK INDIAN FISHERMAN A POOR DEVIL WHO NO DOUBT HAD COME TO GATHER WHAT HE COULD BEFORE HARVEST TIME I SAW THE BOTTOM OF HIS DINGHY MOORED A FEW FEET ABOVE HIS HEAD
6235-36641-0080 SERVED TO LOWER HIM MORE QUICKLY TO THE OCEAN FLOOR THIS WAS THE EXTENT OF HIS EQUIPMENT
6235-36641-0081 HE FELL TO HIS KNEES AND STUFFED HIS SACK WITH SHELLFISH GATHERED AT RANDOM
6235-36641-0082 PULLED UP HIS STONE AND STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN THE WHOLE PROCESS LASTING ONLY THIRTY SECONDS THIS DIVER DIDN'T SEE US A SHADOW CAST BY OUR CRAG HID US FROM HIS VIEW AND BESIDES
6235-36641-0083 HOW COULD THIS POOR INDIAN EVER HAVE GUESSED THAT HUMAN BEINGS CREATURES LIKE HIMSELF
6235-36641-0084 EAVESDROPPING ON HIS MOVEMENTS NOT MISSING A SINGLE DETAIL OF HIS FISHING SO HE WENT UP AND DOWN SEVERAL TIMES HE GATHERED ONLY ABOUT TEN SHELLFISH PER DIVE
6235-36641-0085 BECAUSE HE HAD TO TEAR THEM FROM THE BANKS WHERE EACH CLUNG WITH ITS TOUGH MASS OF FILAMENTS AND HOW MANY OF THESE OYSTERS FOR WHICH HE RISKED HIS LIFE WOULD HAVE NO PEARL IN THEM I OBSERVED HIM WITH GREAT CARE
6235-36641-0086 HIS MOVEMENTS WERE SYSTEMATICALLY EXECUTED AND FOR HALF AN HOUR NO DANGER SEEMED TO THREATEN HIM
6235-36641-0087 WHEN ALL AT ONCE JUST AS THE INDIAN WAS KNEELING ON THE SEAFLOOR I SAW HIM MAKE A FRIGHTENED GESTURE
6235-36641-0088 I UNDERSTOOD HIS FEAR A GIGANTIC SHADOW APPEARED ABOVE THE POOR DIVER IT WAS A SHARK OF HUGE SIZE MOVING IN DIAGONALLY EYES ABLAZE JAWS WIDE OPEN I WAS SPEECHLESS WITH HORROR
6235-36641-0089 WHO JUMPED ASIDE AND AVOIDED THE SHARK'S BITE BUT NOT THE THRASHING OF ITS TAIL BECAUSE THAT TAIL STRUCK HIM ACROSS THE CHEST AND STRETCHED HIM OUT ON THE SEAFLOOR THIS SCENE LASTED BARELY A FEW SECONDS THE SHARK RETURNED ROLLED OVER ON ITS BACK
6235-36641-0090 WHO WAS STATIONED BESIDE ME SUDDENLY STOOD UP THEN HE STRODE RIGHT TOWARD THE MONSTER DAGGER IN HAND READY TO FIGHT IT AT CLOSE QUARTERS JUST AS IT WAS ABOUT TO SNAP UP THE POOR FISHERMAN THE MAN EATER SAW ITS NEW ADVERSARY
6235-36641-0091 REPOSITIONED ITSELF ON ITS BELLY AND HEADED SWIFTLY TOWARD HIM I CAN SEE CAPTAIN NEMO'S BEARING TO THIS DAY BRACING HIMSELF HE WAITED FOR THE FEARSOME MAN EATER
6235-36641-0092 AND WHEN THE LATTER RUSHED AT HIM THE CAPTAIN LEAPED ASIDE WITH PRODIGIOUS QUICKNESS AVOIDED A COLLISION AND SANK HIS DAGGER INTO ITS BELLY BUT THAT WASN'T THE END OF THE STORY A DREADFUL BATTLE WAS JOINED
6235-36641-0093 BELLOWED SO TO SPEAK BLOOD WAS POURING INTO THE WAVES FROM ITS WOUNDS
6235-36641-0094 NOTHING ELSE UNTIL THE MOMENT WHEN
6235-36641-0095 I SAW THE DARING CAPTAIN CLINGING TO ONE OF THE ANIMAL'S FINS FIGHTING THE MONSTER AT CLOSE QUARTERS BELABORING HIS
6235-36641-0096 A DIRECT HIT TO THE HEART IN ITS STRUGGLES THE MAN EATER CHURNED THE WATERY MASS SO FURIOUSLY ITS EDDIES THREATENED TO KNOCK ME OVER I WANTED TO RUN TO THE CAPTAIN'S RESCUE BUT I WAS TRANSFIXED WITH HORROR UNABLE TO MOVE
6235-36641-0097 I STARED WILD EYED I SAW THE FIGHT ENTER A NEW PHASE THE CAPTAIN FELL TO THE SEAFLOOR TOPPLED BY THE ENORMOUS MASS WEIGHING HIM DOWN THEN THE SHARK'S JAWS OPENED ASTOUNDINGLY WIDE LIKE A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL SHEARS
6235-36641-0098 HAD NOT NED LAND QUICK AS THOUGHT RUSHED FORWARD WITH HIS HARPOON AND DRIVEN ITS DREADFUL POINT INTO THE SHARK'S UNDERSIDE THE WAVES WERE SATURATED WITH MASSES OF BLOOD
6235-36641-0099 WHICH THRASHED ABOUT WITH INDESCRIBABLE FURY NED LAND HADN'T MISSED HIS TARGET THIS WAS THE MONSTER'S DEATH RATTLE PIERCED TO THE HEART IT WAS STRUGGLING WITH DREADFUL SPASMS
6235-36641-0100 WHOSE AFTERSHOCKS KNOCKED CONSEIL OFF HIS FEET MEANWHILE NED LAND PULLED THE CAPTAIN CLEAR UNINJURED THE LATTER STOOD UP WENT RIGHT TO THE INDIAN QUICKLY CUT THE ROPE BINDING THE MAN TO HIS STONE
6235-36641-0101 THE THREE OF US FOLLOWED HIM AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER MIRACULOUSLY SAFE WE REACHED THE FISHERMAN'S LONGBOAT CAPTAIN NEMO'S FIRST CONCERN WAS TO REVIVE THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN I WASN'T SURE HE WOULD SUCCEED
6235-36641-0102 I HOPED SO SINCE THE POOR DEVIL HADN'T BEEN UNDER VERY LONG BUT THAT STROKE FROM THE SHARK'S TAIL COULD HAVE BEEN HIS DEATHBLOW
6235-36641-0103 LITTLE BY LITTLE HE OPENED HIS EYES HOW STARTLED HE MUST HAVE FELT HOW FRIGHTENED EVEN AT SEEING FOUR HUGE COPPER CRANIUMS LEANING OVER HIM AND ABOVE ALL
6235-36641-0104 THIS MAGNIFICENT BENEFACTION FROM THE MAN OF THE WATERS TO THE POOR INDIAN FROM CEYLON WAS ACCEPTED BY THE LATTER WITH TREMBLING HANDS HIS BEWILDERED EYES INDICATED
6235-36641-0105 THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW TO WHAT SUPERHUMAN CREATURES HE OWED BOTH HIS LIFE AND HIS FORTUNE AT THE CAPTAIN'S SIGNAL WE RETURNED TO THE BANK OF SHELLFISH AND RETRACING OUR STEPS
6235-36641-0106 WE WALKED FOR HALF AN HOUR UNTIL WE ENCOUNTERED THE ANCHOR CONNECTING THE SEAFLOOR WITH THE NAUTILUS'S SKIFF BACK ON BOARD THE SAILORS HELPED DIVEST US OF OUR HEAVY COPPER CARAPACES CAPTAIN NEMO'S FIRST WORDS WERE SPOKEN TO THE CANADIAN
6235-36641-0107 THANK YOU MISTER LAND HE TOLD HIM TIT FOR TAT CAPTAIN NED LAND REPLIED I OWED IT TO YOU THE GHOST OF A SMILE GLIDED ACROSS THE CAPTAIN'S LIPS AND THAT WAS ALL
6235-36641-0108 TO THE NAUTILUS HE SAID THE LONGBOAT FLEW OVER THE WAVES A FEW MINUTES LATER WE ENCOUNTERED THE SHARK'S CORPSE AGAIN FLOATING FROM THE BLACK MARKINGS ON THE TIPS OF ITS FINS
6235-36641-0109 I RECOGNIZED THE DREADFUL SQUALUS MELANOPTERUS FROM THE SEAS OF THE EAST INDIES
6235-36641-0110 IT WAS MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE FEET LONG ITS ENORMOUS MOUTH OCCUPIED A THIRD OF ITS BODY IT WAS AN ADULT AS COULD BE SEEN FROM THE SIX ROWS OF TEETH FORMING AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE IN ITS UPPER JAW
6235-36641-0111 CONSEIL LOOKED AT IT WITH PURELY SCIENTIFIC FASCINATION AND I'M SURE HE PLACED IT NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON IN THE CLASS
6235-36641-0112 ORDER CHONDROPTERYGIA WITH FIXED GILLS
6235-36641-0113 AROUND OUR LONGBOAT BUT PAYING NO ATTENTION TO US THEY POUNCED ON THE CORPSE AND QUARRELED OVER EVERY SCRAP OF IT BY EIGHT THIRTY WE WERE BACK ON BOARD THE NAUTILUS THERE I FELL TO THINKING ABOUT THE INCIDENTS THAT MARKED OUR EXCURSION
6235-36641-0114 OVER THE MANNAR OYSTERBANK TWO IMPRESSIONS INEVITABLY STOOD OUT ONE CONCERNED CAPTAIN NEMO'S MATCHLESS BRAVERY
6235-36641-0116 WHEN I SHARED THESE IMPRESSIONS WITH HIM HE ANSWERED ME IN A TONE TOUCHED WITH EMOTION THAT INDIAN PROFESSOR LIVES IN THE LAND OF THE OPPRESSED AND I AM TO THIS DAY AND WILL BE UNTIL MY LAST
6258-49755-0000 THE LAY OF MILON HE WHO WOULD TELL DIVERS TALES MUST KNOW HOW TO VARY THE TUNE TO WIN THE FAVOUR OF ANY HE MUST SPEAK TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF ALL I PURPOSE IN THIS PLACE TO SHOW YOU THE STORY OF MILON
6258-49755-0001 AND SINCE FEW WORDS ARE BEST I WILL SET OUT THE ADVENTURE AS BRIEFLY AS I MAY MILON WAS BORN IN SOUTH WALES
6258-49755-0002 SO GREAT WAS HIS PROWESS THAT FROM THE DAY HE WAS DUBBED KNIGHT THERE WAS NO CHAMPION WHO COULD STAND BEFORE HIM IN THE LISTS HE WAS A PASSING FAIR KNIGHT OPEN AND BRAVE COURTEOUS TO HIS FRIENDS AND STERN TO HIS FOES
6258-49755-0003 MEN PRAISED HIS NAME IN WHATEVER REALM THEY TALKED OF GALLANT DEEDS IRELAND NORWAY AND WALES YEA FROM JUTLAND EVEN TO ALBANIA SINCE HE WAS PRAISED BY THE FRANK HE WAS THEREFORE ENVIED OF THE MEAN
6258-49755-0004 NEVERTHELESS BY REASON OF HIS SKILL WITH THE SPEAR HE WAS COUNTED A VERY WORSHIPFUL KNIGHT AND WAS HONOURABLY ENTREATED BY MANY A PRINCE IN DIVERS LANDS IN MILON'S OWN REALM THERE LIVED A LORD WHOSE NAME HAS GONE FROM MIND
6258-49755-0005 WITH THIS BARON DWELT HIS DAUGHTER A PASSING FAIR AND GRACIOUS DAMSEL MUCH TALK HAD THIS MAIDEN HEARD OF MILON'S KNIGHTLY DEEDS SO THAT SHE BEGAN TO SET HER THOUGHTS UPON HIM BECAUSE OF THE GOOD MEN SPOKE OF HIM
6258-49755-0006 SHE SENT HIM A MESSAGE BY A SURE HAND SAYING THAT IF HER LOVE WAS TO HIS MIND SWEETLY WOULD IT BE TO HER HEART MILON REJOICED GREATLY WHEN HE KNEW THIS THING HE THANKED THE LADY FOR HER WORDS GIVING HER LOVE AGAIN IN RETURN FOR HER OWN
6258-49755-0007 BEYOND THIS COURTEOUS ANSWER MILON BESTOWED ON THE MESSENGER COSTLY GIFTS AND MADE HIM PROMISES THAT WERE RICHER STILL FRIEND SAID HE
6258-49755-0008 OF YOUR CHARITY I PRAY YOU THAT I MAY HAVE SPEECH WITH MY FRIEND IN SUCH A FASHION THAT NONE SHALL KNOW OF OUR MEETING CARRY HER THIS MY GOLDEN RING TELL HER ON MY PART THAT SO SHE PLEASES SHE SHALL COME TO ME OR IF IT BE HER BETTER PLEASURE
6258-49755-0009 I WILL GO TO HER THE MESSENGER BADE FAREWELL AND RETURNED TO HIS LADY HE PLACED THE RING IN HER HAND SAYING THAT HE HAD DONE HER WILL AS HE WAS BIDDEN TO DO RIGHT JOYOUS WAS THE DAMSEL TO KNOW THAT MILON'S LOVE WAS TENDER AS HER OWN
6258-49755-0010 SHE REQUIRED HER FRIEND TO COME FOR SPEECH WITHIN THE PRIVATE GARDEN OF HER HOUSE WHERE SHE WAS WONT TO TAKE HER DELIGHT MILON CAME AT HER COMMANDMENT HE CAME SO OFTEN AND SO DEARLY SHE LOVED HIM THAT IN THE END SHE GAVE HIM ALL THAT MAID MAY GIVE
6258-49755-0012 FOR SUCH WAS THE USAGE OF OUR FATHERS IN THE DAYS OF THIS TALE MILON GRIEVED SORELY AND MADE ANSWER THAT HE WOULD DO THE THING THE DAMSEL THOUGHT MOST SEEMLY TO BE DONE WHEN THE CHILD IS BORN REPLIED THE LADY
6258-49755-0013 YOU MUST CARRY HIM FORTHWITH TO MY SISTER SHE IS A RICH DAME PITIFUL AND GOOD AND IS WEDDED TO A LORD OF NORTHUMBERLAND YOU WILL SEND MESSAGES WITH THE BABE BOTH IN WRITING AND BY SPEECH THAT THE LITTLE INNOCENT IS HER SISTER'S CHILD
6258-49755-0014 WHETHER IT BE A BOY OR GIRL HIS MOTHER WILL HAVE SUFFERED MUCH BECAUSE OF HIM AND FOR HER SISTER'S SAKE YOU WILL PRAY HER TO CHERISH THE BABE
6258-49755-0015 BEYOND THIS I SHALL SET YOUR SIGNET BY A LACE ABOUT HIS NECK AND WRITE LETTERS WHEREIN SHALL BE MADE PLAIN THE NAME OF HIS SIRE AND THE SAD STORY OF HIS MOTHER
6258-49755-0016 WHEN HE SHALL HAVE GROWN TALL AND OF AN AGE TO UNDERSTAND THESE MATTERS HIS AUNT WILL GIVE HIM YOUR RING AND REHEARSE TO HIM THE LETTER IF THIS BE DONE PERCHANCE THE ORPHAN WILL NOT BE FATHERLESS ALL HIS DAYS
6258-49755-0017 MILON APPROVED THE COUNSEL OF THE LADY AND WHEN HER TIME HAD COME SHE WAS BROUGHT TO BED OF A BOY THE OLD NURSE WHO TENDED HER MISTRESS WAS PRIVY TO THE DAMSEL'S INMOST MIND
6258-49755-0018 SO WARILY SHE WENT TO WORK SO CUNNING WAS SHE IN GLOSS AND CONCEALMENT THAT NONE WITHIN THE PALACE KNEW THAT THERE WAS AUGHT TO HIDE THE DAMSEL LOOKED UPON HER BOY AND SAW THAT HE WAS VERY FAIR
6258-49755-0019 SHE LACED THE RING ABOUT HIS NECK AND SET THE LETTER THAT IT WERE DEATH TO FIND WITHIN A SILKEN CHATELAINE THE CHILD WAS THEN PLACED IN HIS CRADLE SWATHED CLOSE IN WHITE LINEN
6258-49755-0020 A PILLOW OF FEATHERS WAS PUT BENEATH HIS HEAD AND OVER ALL WAS LAID A WARM COVERLET WADDED WITH FUR IN THIS FASHION THE ANCIENT NURSE GAVE THE BABE TO HIS FATHER WHO AWAITED HIM WITHIN THE GARDEN
6258-49755-0021 MILON COMMENDED THE CHILD TO HIS MEN CHARGING THEM TO CARRY HIM LOYALLY BY SUCH TOWNS AS THEY KNEW TO THAT LADY BEYOND THE HUMBER THE SERVITORS SET FORTH BEARING THE INFANT WITH THEM
6258-49755-0022 SEVEN TIMES A DAY THEY REPOSED THEM IN THEIR JOURNEY SO THAT THE WOMEN MIGHT NOURISH THE BABE AND BATHE AND TEND HIM DULY THEY SERVED THEIR LORD SO FAITHFULLY KEEPING SUCH WATCH UPON THE WAY THAT AT THE LAST THEY WON TO THE LADY TO WHOM THEY WERE BIDDEN
6258-49755-0023 THE LADY RECEIVED THEM COURTEOUSLY AS BECAME HER BREEDING SHE BROKE THE SEAL OF THE LETTER AND WHEN SHE WAS ASSURED OF WHAT WAS THEREIN MARVELLOUSLY SHE CHERISHED THE INFANT THESE HAVING BESTOWED THE BOY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR LORD'S COMMANDMENT RETURNED TO THEIR OWN LAND
6258-49755-0024 MILON WENT FORTH FROM HIS REALM TO SERVE BEYOND THE SEAS FOR GUERDON HIS FRIEND REMAINED WITHIN HER HOUSE AND WAS GRANTED BY HER FATHER IN MARRIAGE TO A RIGHT RICH BARON OF THAT COUNTRY
6258-49755-0025 THOUGH THIS BARON WAS A WORTHY KNIGHT JUSTLY ESTEEMED OF ALL HIS FELLOWS THE DAMSEL WAS GRIEVED BEYOND MEASURE WHEN SHE KNEW HER FATHER'S WILL SHE CALLED TO MIND THE PAST AND REGRETTED THAT MILON HAD GONE FROM THE COUNTRY SINCE HE WOULD HAVE HELPED HER IN HER NEED
6258-49755-0026 ALAS SAID THE LADY WHAT SHALL I DO I DOUBT THAT I AM LOST FOR MY LORD WILL FIND THAT HIS BRIDE IS NOT A MAID IF THIS BECOMES KNOWN THEY WILL MAKE ME A BONDWOMAN FOR ALL MY DAYS
6258-49755-0027 WOULD THAT MY FRIEND WERE HERE TO FREE ME FROM THIS COIL IT WERE GOOD FOR ME TO DIE RATHER THAN TO LIVE BUT BY NO MEANS CAN I ESCAPE FROM THEIR HANDS THEY HAVE SET WARDERS ABOUT ME MEN OLD AND YOUNG WHOM THEY CALL MY CHAMBERLAINS
6258-49755-0028 CONTEMNERS OF LOVE WHO DELIGHT THEMSELVES IN SADNESS BUT ENDURE IT I MUST FOR ALAS I KNOW NOT HOW TO DIE SO ON THE APPOINTED DAY THE LADY WAS WEDDED TO THE BARON
6258-49755-0029 AND HER HUSBAND TOOK HER TO DWELL WITH HIM IN HIS FIEF WHEN MILON RETURNED TO HIS OWN COUNTRY HE WAS RIGHT HEAVY AND SORROWFUL TO LEARN OF THIS MARRIAGE HE LAMENTED HIS WRETCHED CASE BUT IN THIS HE FOUND COMFORT
6258-49755-0030 MILON COMMENCED TO THINK WITHIN HIMSELF HOW BEST HE MIGHT SEND LETTERS TO THE DAMSEL THAT HE WAS COME AGAIN TO HIS HOME YET SO THAT NONE SHOULD HAVE KNOWLEDGE THEREOF HE WROTE A LETTER AND SEALED IT WITH HIS SEAL
6258-49755-0031 THIS MESSAGE HE MADE FAST TO THE NECK AND HID WITHIN THE PLUMAGE OF A SWAN THAT WAS LONG HIS AND WAS GREATLY TO HIS HEART HE BADE HIS SQUIRE TO COME AND MADE HIM HIS MESSENGER
6258-49755-0032 CHANGE THY RAIMENT SWIFTLY SAID HE AND HASTEN TO THE CASTLE OF MY FRIEND TAKE WITH THEE MY SWAN AND SEE THAT NONE NEITHER SERVANT NOR HANDMAID DELIVERS THE BIRD TO MY LADY SAVE THYSELF ALONE
6258-49755-0033 THE SQUIRE DID ACCORDING TO HIS LORD'S COMMANDMENT HE MADE HIM READY QUICKLY AND WENT FORTH BEARING THE SWAN WITH HIM HE WENT BY THE NEAREST ROAD AND PASSING THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CITY CAME BEFORE THE PORTAL OF THE CASTLE
6258-49755-0034 IN ANSWER TO HIS SUMMONS THE PORTER DREW NEAR FRIEND SAID HE HEARKEN TO ME I AM OF CAERLEON AND A FOWLER BY CRAFT WITHIN MY NETS I HAVE SNARED THE MOST MARVELLOUS SWAN IN THE WORLD
6258-49755-0035 THIS WONDROUS BIRD I WOULD BESTOW FORTHWITH UPON YOUR LADY BUT PERFORCE I MUST OFFER HER THE GIFT WITH MY OWN HAND FRIEND REPLIED THE PORTER FOWLERS ARE NOT ALWAYS WELCOMED OF LADIES
6258-49755-0036 IF YOU COME WITH ME I WILL BRING YOU WHERE I MAY KNOW WHETHER IT PLEASES MY LADY TO HAVE SPEECH WITH YOU AND TO RECEIVE YOUR GIFT THE PORTER ENTERED IN THE HALL WHERE HE FOUND NONE BUT TWO LORDS SEATED AT A GREAT TABLE PLAYING CHESS FOR THEIR DELIGHT
6258-49755-0037 HE SWIFTLY RETURNED ON HIS STEPS AND THE FOWLER WITH HIM SO FURTIVELY WITHAL THAT THE LORDS WERE NOT DISTURBED AT THEIR GAME NOR PERCEIVED AUGHT OF THE MATTER THEY WENT THEREFORE TO THE CHAMBER OF THE LADY
6258-49755-0038 IN ANSWER TO THEIR CALL THE DOOR WAS OPENED TO THEM BY A MAIDEN WHO LED THEM BEFORE HER DAME WHEN THE SWAN WAS PROFFERED TO THE LADY IT PLEASED HER TO RECEIVE THE GIFT SHE SUMMONED A VARLET OF HER HOUSEHOLD AND GAVE THE BIRD TO HIS CHARGE
6258-49755-0039 COMMANDING HIM TO KEEP IT SAFELY AND TO SEE THAT IT ATE ENOUGH AND TO SPARE LADY SAID THE SERVITOR I WILL DO YOUR BIDDING WE SHALL NEVER RECEIVE FROM ANY FOWLER ON EARTH SUCH ANOTHER BIRD AS THIS
6258-49755-0040 THE SWAN IS FIT TO SERVE AT A ROYAL TABLE FOR THE BIRD IS PLUMP AS HE IS FAIR THE VARLET PUT THE SWAN IN HIS LADY'S HANDS SHE TOOK THE BIRD KINDLY AND SMOOTHING HIS HEAD AND NECK FELT THE LETTER THAT WAS HIDDEN BENEATH ITS FEATHERS
6258-49755-0041 THE BLOOD PRICKED IN HER VEINS FOR WELL SHE KNEW THAT THE WRITING WAS SENT HER BY HER FRIEND SHE CAUSED THE FOWLER TO BE GIVEN OF HER BOUNTY AND BADE THE MEN TO GO FORTH FROM HER CHAMBER WHEN THEY HAD PARTED THE LADY CALLED A MAIDEN TO HER AID
6258-49755-0042 SHE BROKE THE SEAL AND UNFASTENING THE LETTER CAME UPON THE NAME OF MILON AT THE HEAD SHE KISSED THE NAME A HUNDRED TIMES THROUGH HER TEARS WHEN SHE MIGHT READ THE WRITING SHE LEARNED OF THE GREAT PAIN AND DOLOUR THAT HER LOVER SUFFERED BY DAY AND BY NIGHT
6258-49755-0043 STRIVE TO FIND A PLAN BY WHICH WE MAY SPEAK AS FRIEND TO FRIEND IF YOU WOULD HAVE ME LIVE THE KNIGHT PRAYED HER IN HIS LETTER TO SEND HIM AN ANSWER BY MEANS OF THE SWAN IF THE BIRD WERE WELL GUARDED AND KEPT WITHOUT PROVAND FOR THREE DAYS
6258-49755-0044 HE WOULD OF A SURETY FLY BACK TO THE PLACE FROM WHENCE HE CAME WITH ANY MESSAGE THAT THE LADY MIGHT LACE ABOUT HIS NECK
6258-49755-0045 SHE HELD HIM FOR A MONTH WITHIN HER CHAMBER BUT THIS WAS LESS FROM CHOICE THAN FOR THE CRAFT THAT WAS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN THE INK AND PARCHMENT REQUISITE FOR HER WRITING AT THE END SHE WROTE A LETTER ACCORDING TO HER HEART AND SEALED IT WITH HER RING
6258-49755-0046 THE LADY CAUSED THE SWAN TO FAST FOR THREE FULL DAYS THEN HAVING CONCEALED THE MESSAGE ABOUT HIS NECK LET HIM TAKE HIS FLIGHT THE BIRD WAS ALL ANHUNGERED FOR FOOD AND REMEMBERING WELL THE HOME FROM WHICH HE DREW HE RETURNED THITHER AS QUICKLY AS HIS WINGS MIGHT BEAR HIM
6258-49755-0047 HE KNEW AGAIN HIS TOWN AND HIS MASTER'S HOUSE AND DESCENDED TO THE GROUND AT MILON'S VERY FEET MILON REJOICED GREATLY WHEN HE MARKED HIS OWN HE CAUGHT THE BIRD BY HIS WINGS AND CRYING FOR HIS STEWARD BADE HIM GIVE THE SWAN TO EAT
6258-49755-0048 SWEET TO HIS HEART WAS THE WRITING FOR THE LADY WROTE THAT WITHOUT HIM THERE WAS NO JOY IN HER LIFE AND SINCE IT WAS HIS DESIRE TO HEAR BY THE SWAN IT WOULD BE HER PLEASURE ALSO FOR TWENTY YEARS THE SWAN WAS MADE THE MESSENGER OF THESE TWO LOVERS
6258-49755-0049 WHO MIGHT NEVER WIN TOGETHER THERE WAS NO SPEECH BETWEEN THEM SAVE THAT CARRIED BY THE BIRD THEY CAUSED THE SWAN TO FAST FOR THREE DAYS AND THEN SENT HIM ON HIS ERRAND HE TO WHOM THE LETTER CAME SAW TO IT THAT THE MESSENGER WAS FED TO HEART'S DESIRE
6258-49755-0050 MANY A TIME THE SWAN WENT UPON HIS JOURNEY FOR HOWEVER STRICTLY THE LADY WAS HELD OF HER HUSBAND THERE WAS NONE WHO HAD SUSPICION OF A BIRD THE DAME BEYOND THE HUMBER NOURISHED AND TENDED THE BOY COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE WITH THE GREATEST CARE
6258-49755-0051 WHEN HE WAS COME TO A FITTING AGE SHE MADE HIM TO BE KNIGHTED OF HER LORD FOR GOODLY AND SERVICEABLE WAS THE LAD ON THE SAME DAY THE AUNT READ OVER TO HIM THE LETTER AND PUT IN HIS HAND THE RING
6258-49755-0052 SHE TOLD HIM THE NAME OF HIS MOTHER AND HIS FATHER'S STORY IN ALL THE WORLD THERE WAS NO WORTHIER KNIGHT NOR A MORE CHIVALROUS AND GALLANT GENTLEMAN THE LAD HEARKENED DILIGENTLY TO THE LADY'S TALE
6258-49755-0053 HE REJOICED GREATLY TO HEAR OF HIS FATHER'S PROWESS AND WAS PROUD BEYOND MEASURE OF HIS RENOWN HE CONSIDERED WITHIN HIMSELF SAYING TO HIS OWN HEART THAT MUCH SHOULD BE REQUIRED OF HIS FATHER'S SON AND THAT HE WOULD NOT BE WORTHY OF HIS BLOOD IF HE DID NOT ENDEAVOUR TO MERIT HIS NAME
6258-49755-0054 HE DETERMINED THEREFORE THAT HE WOULD LEAVE HIS COUNTRY AND SEEK ADVENTURE AS A KNIGHT ERRANT BEYOND THE SEA THE VARLET DELAYED NO LONGER THAN THE EVENING ON THE MORROW HE BADE FAREWELL TO HIS AUNT
6258-49755-0055 WHO HAVING WARNED AND ADMONISHED HIM FOR HIS GOOD GAVE HIM LARGELY OF HER WEALTH TO BRING HIM ON HIS WAY HE RODE TO SOUTHAMPTON THAT HE MIGHT FIND A SHIP EQUIPPED FOR SEA AND SO CAME TO BARFLEUR WITHOUT ANY TARRYING THE LAD WENT STRAIGHT TO BRITTANY
6258-49755-0056 WHERE HE SPENT HIS MONEY AND HIMSELF IN FEASTS AND IN TOURNEYS THE RICH MEN OF THE LAND WERE GLAD OF HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR THERE WAS NONE WHO BORE HIMSELF BETTER IN THE PRESS WITH SPEAR OR WITH SWORD
6258-49755-0057 WHAT HE TOOK FROM THE RICH HE BESTOWED ON SUCH KNIGHTS AS WERE POOR AND LUCKLESS THESE LOVED HIM GREATLY SINCE HE GAINED LARGELY AND SPENT FREELY GRANTING OF HIS WEALTH TO ALL WHEREVER THIS KNIGHT SOJOURNED IN THE REALM HE BORE AWAY THE PRIZE
6258-49755-0058 SO DEBONAIR WAS HE AND CHIVALROUS THAT HIS FAME AND PRAISE CROSSED THE WATER AND WERE NOISED ABROAD IN HIS OWN LAND FOLK TOLD HOW A CERTAIN KNIGHT FROM BEYOND THE HUMBER WHO HAD PASSED THE SEA IN QUEST OF WEALTH AND HONOUR HAD SO DONE
6258-49755-0059 THAT BY REASON OF HIS PROWESS HIS LIBERALITY AND HIS MODESTY MEN CALLED HIM THE KNIGHT PEERLESS SINCE THEY DID NOT KNOW HIS NAME THIS PRAISE OF THE GOOD KNIGHT AND OF HIS DEEDS CAME TO BE HEARD OF MILON
6258-49755-0060 VERY DOLENT WAS HE AND SORELY TROUBLED THAT SO YOUNG A KNIGHT SHOULD BE ESTEEMED ABOVE HIS FATHERS HE MARVELLED GREATLY THAT THE STOUT SPEARS OF THE PAST HAD NOT PUT ON THEIR HARNESS AND BROKEN A LANCE FOR THEIR ANCIENT HONOUR ONE THING HE DETERMINED
6258-49755-0061 THAT HE WOULD CROSS THE SEA WITHOUT DELAY SO THAT HE MIGHT JOUST WITH THE DANSELLON AND ABATE HIS PRIDE IN WRATH AND ANGER HE PURPOSED TO FIGHT TO BEAT HIS ADVERSARY FROM THE SADDLE AND BRING HIM AT LAST TO SHAME
6258-49755-0062 AFTER THIS WAS ENDED HE WOULD SEEK HIS SON OF WHOM HE HAD HEARD NOTHING SINCE HE HAD GONE FROM HIS AUNT'S CASTLE MILON CAUSED HIS FRIEND TO KNOW OF HIS WISHES HE OPENED OUT TO HER ALL HIS THOUGHT AND CRAVED HER PERMISSION TO DEPART
6258-49755-0063 THIS LETTER HE SENT BY THE SWAN COMMENDING THE BIRD TO HER CARE WHEN THE LADY HEARD OF HER LOVER'S PURPOSE SHE THANKED HIM FOR HIS COURTESY FOR GREATLY WAS HIS COUNSEL TO HER MIND SHE APPROVED HIS DESIRE TO QUIT THE REALM FOR THE SAKE OF HIS HONOUR
6258-49755-0064 AND FAR FROM PUTTING LET AND HINDRANCE IN HIS PATH TRUSTED THAT IN THE END HE WOULD BRING AGAIN HER SON SINCE MILON WAS ASSURED OF HIS FRIEND'S GOODWILL HE ARRAYED HIMSELF RICHLY AND CROSSING THE SEA TO NORMANDY CAME AFTERWARDS INTO THE LAND OF THE BRETONS
6258-49755-0065 THERE HE SOUGHT THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE LORDS OF THAT REALM AND FARED TO ALL THE TOURNAMENTS OF WHICH HE MIGHT HEAR MILON BORE HIMSELF PROUDLY AND GAVE GRACIOUSLY OF HIS WEALTH AS THOUGH HE WERE RECEIVING A GIFT
6258-49755-0066 HE SOJOURNED TILL THE WINTER WAS PAST IN THAT LAND HE AND A BRAVE COMPANY OF KNIGHTS WHOM HE HELD IN HIS HOUSE WITH HIM WHEN EASTER HAD COME AND THE SEASON THAT MEN GIVE TO TOURNEYS AND WARS AND THE RIGHTING OF THEIR PRIVATE WRONGS
6258-49755-0067 MILON CONSIDERED HOW HE COULD MEET WITH THE KNIGHT WHOM MEN CALLED PEERLESS AT THAT TIME A TOURNAMENT WAS PROCLAIMED TO BE HELD AT MONT SAINT MICHEL MANY A NORMAN AND BRETON RODE TO THE GAME
6258-49755-0068 KNIGHTS OF FLANDERS AND OF FRANCE WERE THERE IN PLENTY BUT FEW FARED FROM ENGLAND
6258-49755-0069 HE INQUIRED DILIGENTLY OF THE YOUNG CHAMPION AND ALL MEN WERE READY TO TELL FROM WHENCE HE CAME AND OF HIS HARNESS AND OF THE BLAZON ON HIS SHIELD AT LENGTH THE KNIGHT APPEARED IN THE LISTS AND MILON LOOKED UPON THE ADVERSARY HE SO GREATLY DESIRED TO SEE
6258-49755-0070 NOW IN THIS TOURNAMENT A KNIGHT COULD JOUST WITH THAT LORD WHO WAS SET OVER AGAINST HIM OR HE COULD SEEK TO BREAK A LANCE WITH HIS CHOSEN FOE
6258-49755-0071 AND HE MIGHT FIND HIMSELF OPPOSED EITHER BY HIS COMRADE OR HIS ENEMY MILON DID WELL AND WORSHIPFULLY IN THE PRESS AND WAS PRAISED OF MANY THAT DAY BUT THE KNIGHT PEERLESS CARRIED THE CRY FROM ALL HIS FELLOWS FOR NONE MIGHT STAND BEFORE HIM NOR RIVAL HIM IN SKILL AND ADDRESS
6258-49755-0072 MILON OBSERVED HIM CURIOUSLY THE LAD STRUCK SO HEAVILY HE THRUST HOME SO SHREWDLY THAT MILON'S HATRED CHANGED TO ENVY AS HE WATCHED VERY COMELY SHOWED THE VARLET AND MUCH TO MILON'S MIND
6258-49755-0073 THE OLDER KNIGHT SET HIMSELF OVER AGAINST THE CHAMPION AND THEY MET TOGETHER IN THE CENTRE OF THE FIELD MILON STRUCK HIS ADVERSARY SO FIERCELY THAT THE LANCE SPLINTERED IN HIS GAUNTLET BUT THE YOUNG KNIGHT KEPT HIS SEAT WITHOUT EVEN LOSING A STIRRUP
6258-49755-0074 IN RETURN HIS SPEAR WAS AIMED WITH SUCH CUNNING THAT HE BORE HIS ANTAGONIST TO THE GROUND MILON LAY UPON THE EARTH BAREHEADED FOR HIS HELMET WAS UNLACED IN THE SHOCK
6258-49755-0075 HIS HAIR AND BEARD SHOWED WHITE TO ALL AND THE VARLET WAS HEAVY TO LOOK ON HIM WHOM HE HAD OVERTHROWN HE CAUGHT THE DESTRIER BY THE BRIDLE AND LED HIM BEFORE THE STRICKEN MAN SIR SAID HE I PRAY YOU TO GET UPON YOUR HORSE
6258-49755-0076 I AM RIGHT GRIEVED AND VEXED THAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS WRONG BELIEVE ME THAT IT WAS WROUGHT UNWITTINGLY MILON SPRANG UPON HIS STEED HE APPROVED THE COURTESY OF HIS ADVERSARY AND LOOKING UPON THE HAND THAT HELD HIS BRIDLE HE KNEW AGAIN HIS RING
6258-49755-0077 HE MADE INQUIRY OF THE LAD FRIEND SAID HE HEARKEN TO ME TELL ME NOW THE NAME OF THY SIRE HOW ART THOU CALLED WHO IS THY MOTHER I HAVE SEEN MUCH AND GONE TO AND FRO ABOUT THE WORLD
6258-49755-0078 YET NEVER ONCE BY ANY KNIGHT HAVE I BEEN BORNE FROM MY HORSE THIS DAY I AM OVERTHROWN BY A BOY AND YET I CANNOT HELP BUT LOVE THEE THE VARLET ANSWERED
6258-49755-0079 I KNOW LITTLE OF MY FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT HIS NAME IS MILON AND THAT HE WAS A KNIGHT OF WALES HE LOVED THE DAUGHTER OF A RICH MAN AND WAS LOVED AGAIN MY MOTHER BORE ME IN SECRET AND CAUSED ME TO BE CARRIED TO NORTHUMBERLAND WHERE I WAS TAUGHT AND TENDED
6258-49755-0080 AN OLD AUNT WAS AT THE COSTS OF MY NOURISHING SHE KEPT ME AT HER SIDE TILL OF ALL HER GIFTS SHE GAVE ME HORSE AND ARMS AND SENT ME HERE WHERE I HAVE REMAINED IN HOPE AND WISH I PURPOSE TO CROSS THE SEA AND RETURN TO MY OWN REALM
6258-49755-0081 THERE I WOULD SEEK OUT MY FATHER AND LEARN HOW IT STANDS BETWEEN HIM AND MY MOTHER
6258-49755-0082 BUT MUST LOVE ME AS A SON AND EVER HOLD ME DEAR WHEN MILON HEARD THESE WORDS HE COULD ENDURE THEM NO FURTHER HE GOT HIM SWIFTLY FROM HIS HORSE AND TAKING THE LAD BY THE FRINGE OF HIS HAUBERK HE CRIED PRAISE BE TO GOD FOR NOW AM I HEALED
6258-49755-0083 FAIR FRIEND BY MY FAITH THOU ART MY VERY SON FOR WHOM I CAME FORTH FROM MY OWN LAND AND HAVE SOUGHT THROUGH ALL THIS REALM THE VARLET CLIMBED FROM THE SADDLE AND STOOD UPON HIS FEET FATHER AND SON KISSED EACH OTHER TENDERLY WITH MANY COMFORTABLE WORDS
6258-49755-0084 THEIR LOVE WAS FAIR TO SEE AND THOSE WHO LOOKED UPON THEIR MEETING WEPT FOR JOY AND PITY MILON AND HIS SON DEPARTED FROM THE TOURNAMENT SO SOON AS IT CAME TO AN END FOR THE KNIGHT DESIRED GREATLY TO SPEAK TO THE VARLET AT LEISURE AND TO OPEN BEFORE HIM ALL HIS MIND
6258-49755-0085 THEY RODE TO THEIR HOSTEL AND WITH THE KNIGHTS OF THEIR FELLOWSHIP PASSED THE HOURS IN MIRTH AND REVELRY MILON SPOKE TO THE LAD OF HIS MOTHER
6258-49755-0086 THE SON MADE ANSWER IN FAITH FAIR FATHER LET US RETURN TO OUR OWN LAND THERE I WILL SLAY THIS HUSBAND AND YOU SHALL YET BE MY MOTHER'S LORD
6258-49755-0087 THIS BEING ACCORDED BETWEEN THEM ON THE MORROW THEY MADE THEM READY FOR THE JOURNEY AND BIDDING FAREWELL TO THEIR FRIENDS SET FORTH FOR WALES THEY EMBARKED IN A PROPITIOUS HOUR FOR A FAIR WIND CARRIED THE SHIP RIGHT SWIFTLY TO ITS HAVEN
6258-49755-0088 THEY HAD NOT RIDDEN FAR UPON THEIR ROAD WHEN THEY MET A CERTAIN SQUIRE OF THE LADY'S HOUSEHOLD ON HIS WAY TO BRITTANY BEARING LETTERS TO MILON HIS TASK WAS DONE LONG BEFORE SUNDOWN IN CHANCING ON THE KNIGHT
6258-49755-0089 HE GAVE OVER THE SEALED WRITING WITH WHICH HE WAS CHARGED PRAYING THE KNIGHT TO HASTEN TO HIS FRIEND WITHOUT ANY TARRYING SINCE HER HUSBAND WAS IN HIS GRAVE MILON REJOICED GREATLY WHEN HE KNEW THIS THING HE SHOWED THE MESSAGE TO HIS SON AND PRESSED FORWARD WITHOUT PAUSE OR REST
6258-49755-0090 THEY MADE SUCH SPEED THAT AT THE END THEY CAME TO THE CASTLE WHERE THE LADY HAD HER LODGING LIGHT OF HEART WAS SHE WHEN SHE CLASPED AGAIN HER CHILD THESE TWO FOND LOVERS SOUGHT NEITHER COUNTENANCE OF THEIR KIN NOR COUNSEL OF ANY MAN
6258-49755-0091 THEIR SON HANDSELLED THEM TOGETHER AND GAVE THE MOTHER TO HIS SIRE
6269-66176-0000 THE SNOW FORT ON SLATTER'S HILL THE MEMORY OF MAN EVEN THAT OF THE OLDEST INHABITANT RUNNETH NOT BACK TO THE TIME WHEN THERE DID NOT EXIST A FEUD BETWEEN THE NORTH END AND THE SOUTH END BOYS OF RIVERMOUTH
6269-66176-0001 THE ORIGIN OF THE FEUD IS INVOLVED IN MYSTERY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHICH PARTY WAS THE FIRST AGGRESSOR IN THE FAR OFF ANTEREVOLUTIONARY AGES
6269-66176-0002 ENTERTAINED A MORTAL HATRED FOR EACH OTHER AND THAT THIS HATRED HAD BEEN HANDED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION LIKE MILES STANDISH'S PUNCH BOWL I KNOW NOT WHAT LAWS NATURAL OR UNNATURAL REGULATED THE WARMTH OF THE QUARREL
6269-66176-0003 THIS WINTER BOTH PARTIES WERE UNUSUALLY LIVELY AND ANTAGONISTIC GREAT WAS THE WRATH OF THE SOUTH ENDERS WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE NORTH ENDERS HAD THROWN UP A FORT ON THE CROWN OF SLATTER'S HILL SLATTER'S HILL
6269-66176-0004 OR NO MAN'S LAND AS IT WAS GENERALLY CALLED WAS A RISE OF GROUND COVERING PERHAPS AN ACRE AND A QUARTER SITUATED ON AN IMAGINARY LINE MARKING THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE TWO DISTRICTS AN IMMENSE STRATUM OF GRANITE
6269-66176-0005 WHICH HERE AND THERE THRUST OUT A WRINKLED BOULDER PREVENTED THE SITE FROM BEING USED FOR BUILDING PURPOSES THE STREET RAN ON EITHER SIDE OF THE HILL FROM ONE PART OF WHICH A QUANTITY OF ROCK HAD BEEN REMOVED TO FORM THE UNDERPINNING OF THE NEW JAIL
6269-66176-0006 THIS EXCAVATION MADE THE APPROACH FROM THAT POINT ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE RAGGED LEDGES WERE A GLITTER WITH ICE
6269-66176-0007 FLOATING DEFIANTLY FROM THE FLAG STAFF IN LESS THAN AN HOUR IT WAS KNOWN ALL OVER TOWN IN MILITARY CIRCLES AT LEAST THAT THE PUDDLE DOCKERS AND THE RIVER RATS
6269-66176-0009 LAY BEHIND THE WALLS OF FORT SLATTER WITH THREE HUNDRED COMPACT SNOWBALLS PILED UP IN PYRAMIDS AWAITING THE APPROACH OF THE ENEMY THE ENEMY WAS NOT SLOW IN MAKING HIS APPROACH FIFTY STRONG
6269-66176-0010 HEADED BY ONE MAT AMES OUR FORCES WERE UNDER THE COMMAND OF GENERAL J HARRIS BEFORE THE ACTION COMMENCED
6269-66176-0011 IT WAS STIPULATED THAT THE SOUTH ENDERS SHOULD ASSAULT IT ONLY ON WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY AFTERNOONS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TWO AND SIX FOR THEM TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE PLACE AT ANY OTHER TIME WAS NOT TO CONSTITUTE A CAPTURE
6269-66176-0012 BUT ON THE CONTRARY WAS TO BE CONSIDERED A DISHONORABLE AND COWARDLY ACT THE NORTH ENDERS ON THE OTHER HAND AGREED TO GIVE UP THE FORT
6269-66176-0013 A FOOTING ON THE PARAPET AND WERE ABLE TO HOLD THE SAME FOR THE SPACE OF TWO MINUTES
6269-66176-0014 NOR WAS IT PERMISSIBLE TO USE FROZEN AMMUNITION A SNOW BALL SOAKED IN WATER AND LEFT OUT TO COOL WAS A PROJECTILE WHICH IN PREVIOUS YEARS HAD BEEN RESORTED TO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS THESE PRELIMINARIES SETTLED
6269-66176-0015 THE COMMANDERS RETIRED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CORPS THE INTERVIEW HAD TAKEN PLACE ON THE HILLSIDE BETWEEN THE OPPOSING LINES GENERAL HARRIS DIVIDED HIS MEN INTO TWO BODIES THE FIRST COMPRISED THE MOST SKILFUL MARKSMEN
6269-66176-0016 OR GUNNERS THE SECOND THE RESERVE FORCE
6269-66176-0017 WAS COMPOSED OF THE STRONGEST BOYS WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO REPEL THE SCALING PARTIES AND TO MAKE OCCASIONAL SALLIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF CAPTURING PRISONERS WHO WERE BOUND BY THE ARTICLES OF TREATY TO FAITHFULLY SERVE UNDER OUR FLAG UNTIL THEY WERE EXCHANGED
6269-66176-0018 THE REPELLERS WERE CALLED LIGHT INFANTRY BUT WHEN THEY CARRIED ON OPERATIONS BEYOND THE FORT THEY BECAME CAVALRY IT WAS ALSO THEIR DUTY WHEN NOT OTHERWISE ENGAGED TO MANUFACTURE SNOW BALLS THE GENERAL'S STAFF CONSISTED OF FIVE TEMPLARS
6269-66176-0019 I AMONG THE NUMBER WITH THE RANK OF MAJOR WHO CARRIED THE GENERAL'S ORDERS AND LOOKED AFTER THE WOUNDED GENERAL MAT AMES A VETERAN COMMANDER WAS NO LESS WIDE AWAKE IN THE DISPOSITION OF HIS ARMY FIVE COMPANIES
6269-66176-0020 EACH NUMBERING BUT SIX MEN IN ORDER NOT TO PRESENT TOO BIG A TARGET TO OUR SHARPSHOOTERS WERE TO CHARGE THE FORT FROM DIFFERENT POINTS THEIR ADVANCE BEING COVERED BY A HEAVY FIRE FROM THE GUNNERS POSTED IN THE REAR
6269-66176-0021 EACH SCALER WAS PROVIDED WITH ONLY TWO ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION WHICH WERE NOT TO BE USED UNTIL HE HAD MOUNTED THE BREASTWORK AND COULD DELIVER HIS SHOTS ON OUR HEADS
6269-66176-0022 A SINGLE BALL FROM THE DEXTEROUS BAND OF GENERAL HARRIS TAKING GENERAL AMES IN THE VERY PIT OF HIS STOMACH A CHEER WENT UP FROM FORT SLATTER
6269-66176-0023 IN AN INSTANT THE AIR WAS THICK WITH FLYING MISSILES IN THE MIDST OF WHICH WE DIMLY DESCRIED THE STORMING PARTIES SWEEPING UP THE HILL SHOULDER TO SHOULDER THE SHOUTS OF THE LEADERS AND THE SNOWBALLS BURSTING LIKE SHELLS ABOUT OUR EARS MADE IT VERY LIVELY
6269-66176-0024 NOT MORE THAN A DOZEN OF THE ENEMY SUCCEEDED IN REACHING THE CREST OF THE HILL FIVE OF THESE CLAMBERED UPON THE ICY WALLS WHERE THEY WERE INSTANTLY GRABBED BY THE LEGS AND JERKED INTO THE FORT THE REST RETIRED CONFUSED AND BLINDED BY OUR WELL DIRECTED FIRE
6269-66176-0025 SAID SOLDIERS I AM PROUD OF YOU MY HEART SWELLED IN MY BOSOM
6269-66176-0026 SIX NORTH ENDERS HAVING RUSHED OUT TO HARASS THE DISCOMFITED ENEMY WERE GALLANTLY CUT OFF BY GENERAL AMES AND CAPTURED AMONG THESE WERE LIEUTENANT P WHITCOMB
6269-66176-0027 OF GENERAL HARRIS'S STAFF WHITCOMB WAS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE SHOTS ON OUR SIDE THOUGH HE WAS NOT MUCH TO BOAST OF IN A ROUGH AND TUMBLE FIGHT OWING TO THE WEAKNESS BEFORE MENTIONED GENERAL AMES PUT HIM AMONG THE GUNNERS
6269-66176-0028 AND WE WERE QUICKLY MADE AWARE OF THE LOSS WE HAD SUSTAINED BY RECEIVING A FREQUENT ARTFUL BALL WHICH SEEMED TO LIGHT WITH UNERRING INSTINCT ON ANY NOSE THAT WAS THE LEAST BIT EXPOSED
6269-66176-0029 FIRED POINTBLANK TO TURN A CORNER AND HIT A BOY WHO CONSIDERED HIMSELF ABSOLUTELY SAFE BUT WE HAD NO TIME FOR VAIN REGRETS THE BATTLE RAGED ALREADY THERE WERE TWO BAD CASES OF BLACK EYE
6269-66176-0030 AND ONE OF NOSEBLEED IN THE HOSPITAL IT WAS GLORIOUS EXCITEMENT THOSE PELL MELL ONSLAUGHTS AND HAND TO HAND STRUGGLES TWICE WE WERE WITHIN AN ACE OF BEING DRIVEN FROM OUR STRONGHOLD WHEN GENERAL HARRIS AND HIS STAFF
6269-66176-0031 LEAPED RECKLESSLY UPON THE RAMPARTS AND HURLED THE BESIEGERS HEELS OVER HEAD DOWN HILL AT SUNSET THE GARRISON OF FORT SLATTER WAS STILL UNCONQUERED AND THE SOUTH ENDERS IN A SOLID PHALANX MARCHED OFF WHISTLING
6269-66176-0032 YANKEE DOODLE WHILE WE CHEERED AND JEERED THEM UNTIL THEY WERE OUT OF HEARING GENERAL AMES REMAINED BEHIND TO EFFECT AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS WE HELD THIRTEEN OF HIS MEN AND HE ELEVEN OF OURS
6269-66176-0033 GENERAL AMES PROPOSED TO CALL IT AN EVEN THING SINCE MANY OF HIS ELEVEN PRISONERS WERE OFFICERS WHILE NEARLY ALL OUR THIRTEEN CAPTIVES WERE PRIVATES A DISPUTE ARISING ON THIS POINT
6269-66176-0034 THE TWO NOBLE GENERALS CAME TO FISTICUFFS AND IN THE FRACAS OUR BRAVE COMMANDER GOT HIS REMAINING WELL EYE BADLY DAMAGED THIS DIDN'T PREVENT HIM FROM WRITING A GENERAL ORDER THE NEXT DAY ON A SLATE IN WHICH HE COMPLIMENTED THE TROOPS
6269-66176-0035 ON THEIR HEROIC BEHAVIOR ON THE FOLLOWING WEDNESDAY THE SIEGE WAS RENEWED I FORGET WHETHER IT WAS ON THAT AFTERNOON OR THE NEXT THAT WE LOST FORT SLATTER BUT LOSE IT WE DID WITH MUCH VALUABLE AMMUNITION AND SEVERAL MEN
6269-66176-0036 WE FORCED GENERAL AMES TO CAPITULATE
6269-66176-0037 GENERAL AMES HANDLED HIS MEN WITH GREAT SKILL HIS DEADLIEST FOE COULD NOT DENY THAT ONCE HE OUTGENERALLED OUR COMMANDER IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER HE MASSED HIS GUNNERS ON OUR LEFT AND OPENED A BRISK FIRE
6269-66176-0038 UNDER COVER OF WHICH A SINGLE COMPANY SIX MEN ADVANCED ON THAT ANGLE OF THE FORT OUR RESERVES ON THE RIGHT RUSHED OVER TO DEFEND THE THREATENED POINT MEANWHILE FOUR COMPANIES OF THE ENEMY'S SCALERS
6269-66176-0039 MADE A DETOUR ROUND THE FOOT OF THE HILL AND DASHED INTO FORT SLATTER WITHOUT OPPOSITION AT THE SAME MOMENT GENERAL AMES'S GUNNERS CLOSED IN ON OUR LEFT AND THERE WE WERE BETWEEN TWO FIRES OF COURSE WE HAD TO VACATE THE FORT
6269-66176-0040 A CLOUD RESTED ON GENERAL HARRIS'S MILITARY REPUTATION UNTIL HIS SUPERIOR TACTICS ENABLED HIM TO DISPOSSESS THE ENEMY
6269-66176-0041 AT LENGTH THE PROVISION AGAINST USING HEAVY SUBSTANCES IN THE SNOW BALLS WAS DISREGARDED A BALL STUCK FULL OF SAND BIRD SHOT CAME TEARING INTO FORT SLATTER IN RETALIATION GENERAL HARRIS ORDERED A BROADSIDE OF SHELLS
6269-66176-0042 AFTER THIS BOTH SIDES NEVER FAILED TO FREEZE THEIR AMMUNITION IT WAS NO LONGER CHILD'S PLAY TO MARCH UP TO THE WALLS OF FORT SLATTER NOR WAS THE POSITION OF THE BESIEGED LESS PERILOUS AT EVERY ASSAULT THREE OR FOUR BOYS
6269-66176-0043 ON EACH SIDE WERE DISABLED IT WAS NOT AN INFREQUENT OCCURRENCE FOR THE COMBATANTS TO HOLD UP A FLAG OF TRUCE WHILE THEY REMOVED SOME INSENSIBLE COMRADE
6269-66176-0044 MATTERS GREW WORSE AND WORSE SEVEN NORTH ENDERS HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY WOUNDED AND A DOZEN SOUTH ENDERS WERE REPORTED ON THE SICK LIST THE SELECTMEN OF THE TOWN AWOKE TO THE FACT OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AND DETAILED A POSSE OF POLICE
6269-66176-0045 TO PREVENT FURTHER DISTURBANCE THE BOYS AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL SOUTH ENDERS AS IT HAPPENED FINDING THEMSELVES ASSAILED IN THE REAR AND ON THE FLANK TURNED ROUND AND ATTEMPTED TO BEAT OFF THE WATCHMEN
6269-66176-0046 IN THIS THEY WERE SUSTAINED BY NUMEROUS VOLUNTEERS FROM THE FORT WHO LOOKED UPON THE INTERFERENCE AS TYRANNICAL THE WATCH WERE DETERMINED FELLOWS AND CHARGED THE BOYS VALIANTLY DRIVING THEM ALL INTO THE FORT WHERE WE MADE COMMON CAUSE
6269-66176-0047 FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE LIKE THE BEST OF FRIENDS IN VAIN THE FOUR GUARDIANS OF THE PEACE RUSHED UP THE HILL FLOURISHING THEIR CLUBS AND CALLING UPON US TO SURRENDER THEY COULD NOT GET WITHIN TEN YARDS OF THE FORT OUR FIRE WAS SO DESTRUCTIVE
6269-66176-0048 IN ONE OF THE ONSETS A MAN NAMED MUGRIDGE MORE VALOROUS THAN HIS PEERS THREW HIMSELF UPON THE PARAPET WHEN HE WAS SEIZED BY TWENTY PAIRS OF HANDS AND DRAGGED INSIDE THE BREASTWORK WHERE FIFTEEN BOYS SAT DOWN ON HIM TO KEEP HIM QUIET
6269-66176-0049 THE WATCH SENT FOR REINFORCEMENTS THEIR CALL WAS RESPONDED TO NOT ONLY BY THE WHOLE CONSTABULARY FORCE EIGHT MEN BUT BY A NUMEROUS BODY OF CITIZENS WHO HAD BECOME ALARMED AT THE PROSPECT OF A RIOT
6269-66176-0050 THIS FORMIDABLE ARRAY BROUGHT US TO OUR SENSES WE BEGAN TO THINK THAT MAYBE DISCRETION WAS THE BETTER PART OF VALOR GENERAL HARRIS AND GENERAL AMES WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE STAFFS HELD A COUNCIL OF WAR IN THE HOSPITAL
6269-66176-0051 THE EVENT PASSED INTO A LEGEND AND AFTERWARDS WHEN LATER INSTANCES OF PLUCK AND ENDURANCE WERE SPOKEN OF THE BOYS WOULD SAY
6269-66184-0000 I KNEW THEN WHAT HAD HAPPENED AS WELL AS I KNOW IT NOW BUT WHICH WAS IT FATHER OR MOTHER I DO NOT LIKE TO LOOK BACK TO THE AGONY AND SUSPENSE OF THAT MOMENT MY FATHER HAD DIED AT NEW ORLEANS DURING ONE OF HIS WEEKLY VISITS TO THE CITY
6269-66184-0001 THE LETTER BEARING THESE TIDINGS HAD REACHED RIVERMOUTH THE EVENING OF MY FLIGHT HAD PASSED ME ON THE ROAD BY THE DOWN TRAIN I MUST TURN BACK FOR A MOMENT TO THAT EVENTFUL EVENING
6269-66184-0002 WHEN I FAILED TO MAKE MY APPEARANCE AT SUPPER THE CAPTAIN BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT I HAD REALLY STARTED ON MY WILD TOUR SOUTHWARD A CONJECTURE WHICH SAILOR BEN'S ABSENCE HELPED TO CONFIRM I HAD EVIDENTLY GOT OFF BY THE TRAIN
6269-66184-0003 AND SAILOR BEN HAD FOLLOWED ME THERE WAS NO TELEGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BOSTON AND RIVERMOUTH IN THOSE DAYS SO MY GRANDFATHER COULD DO NOTHING BUT AWAIT THE RESULT EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER MAIL TO BOSTON
6269-66184-0004 HE COULD NOT HAVE AVAILED HIMSELF OF IT NOT KNOWING HOW TO ADDRESS A MESSAGE TO THE FUGITIVES THE POST OFFICE WAS NATURALLY THE LAST PLACE EITHER I OR THE ADMIRAL WOULD THINK OF VISITING
6269-66184-0005 MY GRANDFATHER HOWEVER WAS TOO FULL OF TROUBLE TO ALLOW THIS TO ADD TO HIS DISTRESS HE KNEW THAT THE FAITHFUL OLD SAILOR WOULD NOT LET ME COME TO ANY HARM AND EVEN IF I HAD MANAGED FOR THE TIME BEING TO ELUDE HIM
6269-66184-0006 WAS SURE TO BRING ME BACK SOONER OR LATER OUR RETURN THEREFORE BY THE FIRST TRAIN ON THE FOLLOWING DAY DID NOT SURPRISE HIM I WAS GREATLY PUZZLED AS I HAVE SAID BY THE GENTLE MANNER OF HIS RECEPTION
6269-66184-0007 AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO TELL ME
6269-66184-0008 IRRESOLUTELY AND THEN COMMENCED READING IT ALOUD
6269-66184-0009 I CAN'T READ IT TOM SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN BREAKING DOWN I THOUGHT I COULD HE HANDED IT TO ME I TOOK THE LETTER MECHANICALLY AND HURRIED AWAY WITH IT TO MY LITTLE ROOM
6269-66184-0010 THE WEEK THAT FOLLOWED THE RECEIPT OF THIS LETTER IS NEARLY A BLANK IN MY MEMORY I REMEMBER THAT THE DAYS APPEARED ENDLESS THAT AT TIMES I COULD NOT REALIZE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAD BEFALLEN US
6269-66184-0011 AND MY HEART UPBRAIDED ME FOR NOT FEELING A DEEPER GRIEF THAT A FULL SENSE OF MY LOSS WOULD NOW AND THEN SWEEP OVER ME LIKE AN INSPIRATION AND I WOULD STEAL AWAY TO MY CHAMBER
6269-66184-0012 I REMEMBER THIS BUT LITTLE MORE AS THE DAYS WENT BY MY FIRST GRIEF SUBSIDED AND IN ITS PLACE GREW UP A WANT WHICH I HAVE EXPERIENCED AT EVERY STEP IN LIFE FROM BOYHOOD TO MANHOOD OFTEN
6269-66184-0013 EVEN NOW AFTER ALL THESE YEARS WHEN I SEE A LAD OF TWELVE OR FOURTEEN WALKING BY HIS FATHER'S SIDE AND GLANCING MERRILY UP AT HIS FACE I TURN AND LOOK AFTER THEM AND AM CONSCIOUS THAT I HAVE MISSED COMPANIONSHIP MOST SWEET AND SACRED
6269-66184-0014 I SHALL NOT DWELL ON THIS PORTION OF MY STORY THERE WERE MANY TRANQUIL PLEASANT HOURS IN STORE FOR ME AT THAT PERIOD AND I PREFER TO TURN TO THEM
6269-66184-0015 MY MOTHER HAD ARRIVED AT NEW YORK AND WOULD BE WITH US THE NEXT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WEEKS YEARS IT SEEMED TO ME SOMETHING OF THE OLD CHEERFULNESS MINGLED WITH OUR CONVERSATION ROUND THE EVENING LAMP
6269-66184-0016 I WAS TO GO TO BOSTON WITH THE CAPTAIN TO MEET HER AND BRING HER HOME I NEED NOT DESCRIBE THAT MEETING WITH MY MOTHER'S HAND IN MINE ONCE MORE ALL THE LONG YEARS WE HAD BEEN PARTED APPEARED LIKE A DREAM
6269-66184-0017 VERY DEAR TO ME WAS THE SIGHT OF THAT SLENDER PALE WOMAN PASSING FROM ROOM TO ROOM AND LENDING A PATIENT GRACE AND BEAUTY TO THE SADDENED LIFE
6269-66184-0018 EVERYTHING WAS CHANGED WITH US NOW THERE WERE CONSULTATIONS WITH LAWYERS AND SIGNING OF PAPERS AND CORRESPONDENCE FOR MY FATHER'S AFFAIRS HAD BEEN LEFT IN GREAT CONFUSION
6269-66184-0019 THE EVENINGS WERE NOT LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO HEAR ALL MY MOTHER HAD TO TELL OF THE SCENES SHE HAD PASSED THROUGH IN THE ILL FATED CITY THEN THERE WERE OLD TIMES TO TALK OVER FULL OF REMINISCENCES OF AUNT CHLOE AND LITTLE BLACK SAM
6269-66184-0020 LITTLE BLACK SAM BY THE BY HAD BEEN TAKEN BY HIS MASTER FROM MY FATHER'S SERVICE TEN MONTHS PREVIOUSLY AND PUT ON A SUGAR PLANTATION NEAR BATON ROUGE NOT RELISHING THE CHANGE SAM HAD RUN AWAY
6269-66184-0021 AND BY SOME MYSTERIOUS AGENCY GOT INTO CANADA
6269-66184-0022 INDECOROUS MESSAGES TO HIS LATE OWNER
6269-66184-0023 IN ONE OF THE CHOLERA HOSPITAL WARDS AND THE DESMOULINS NEAR NEIGHBORS OF OURS HAD PURCHASED THE PRETTY STONE HOUSE AMONG THE ORANGE TREES HOW ALL THESE SIMPLE DETAILS INTERESTED ME WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD
6269-66184-0024 BY ANY BOY WHO HAS BEEN LONG ABSENT FROM HOME I WAS SORRY WHEN IT BECAME NECESSARY TO DISCUSS QUESTIONS
6269-66184-0025 AND SEND ME TO COLLEGE FOR WHICH I WAS NEARLY FITTED BUT OUR MEANS DID NOT ADMIT OF THIS THE CAPTAIN TOO COULD ILL AFFORD TO BEAR THE EXPENSE FOR HIS LOSSES BY THE FAILURE OF THE NEW ORLEANS BUSINESS HAD BEEN HEAVY
6269-66184-0026 YET HE INSISTED ON THE PLAN NOT SEEING CLEARLY WHAT OTHER DISPOSAL TO MAKE OF ME IN THE MIDST OF OUR DISCUSSIONS A LETTER CAME FROM MY UNCLE SNOW A MERCHANT IN NEW YORK GENEROUSLY OFFERING ME A PLACE IN HIS COUNTING HOUSE
6269-66184-0027 THE CASE RESOLVED ITSELF INTO THIS IF I WENT TO COLLEGE I SHOULD HAVE TO BE DEPENDENT ON CAPTAIN NUTTER FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND AT THE END OF THE COLLEGIATE COURSE
6269-66184-0028 IF I ACCEPTED MY UNCLE'S OFFER I MIGHT HOPE TO WORK MY WAY TO INDEPENDENCE WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME IT WAS HARD TO GIVE UP THE LONG CHERISHED DREAM OF BEING A HARVARD BOY BUT I GAVE IT UP
6269-66184-0029 THE DECISION ONCE MADE IT WAS UNCLE SNOW'S WISH THAT I SHOULD ENTER HIS COUNTING HOUSE IMMEDIATELY THE CAUSE OF MY GOOD UNCLE'S HASTE WAS THIS HE WAS AFRAID THAT I WOULD TURN OUT TO BE A POET BEFORE HE COULD MAKE A MERCHANT OF ME
6269-66184-0030 HIS FEARS WERE BASED UPON THE FACT THAT I HAD PUBLISHED IN THE RIVERMOUTH BARNACLE SOME VERSES ADDRESSED IN A FAMILIAR MANNER TO THE MOON NOW THE IDEA OF A BOY WITH HIS LIVING TO GET
6269-66184-0031 STRUCK THE MERCANTILE MIND AS MONSTROUS IT WAS NOT ONLY A BAD INVESTMENT IT WAS LUNACY WE ADOPTED UNCLE SNOW'S VIEWS SO FAR AS TO ACCEDE TO HIS PROPOSITION FORTHWITH
6269-66184-0032 MY MOTHER I NEGLECTED TO SAY WAS ALSO TO RESIDE IN NEW YORK I SHALL NOT DRAW A PICTURE OF PEPPER WHITCOMB'S DISGUST WHEN THE NEWS WAS IMPARTED TO HIM NOR ATTEMPT TO PAINT SAILOR BEN'S DISTRESS AT THE PROSPECT
6269-66184-0033 OF LOSING HIS LITTLE MESSMATE IN THE EXCITEMENT OF PREPARING FOR THE JOURNEY I DIDN'T FEEL ANY VERY DEEP REGRET MYSELF BUT WHEN THE MOMENT CAME FOR LEAVING AND I SAW MY SMALL TRUNK LASHED UP BEHIND THE CARRIAGE
6269-66184-0034 AND A MIST FILLED MY EYES SHUTTING OUT THE GROUP OF SCHOOLFELLOWS
6269-66184-0035 WHO HAD COME DOWN TO THE HOUSE TO SEE ME OFF AS THE CARRIAGE SWEPT ROUND THE CORNER I LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW TO TAKE A LAST LOOK AT SAILOR BEN'S COTTAGE AND THERE WAS THE ADMIRAL'S FLAG FLYING AT HALF MAST
6269-66185-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY TWO EXEUNT OMNES WITH THE CLOSE OF MY SCHOOL DAYS AT RIVERMOUTH THIS MODEST CHRONICLE ENDS THE NEW LIFE UPON WHICH I ENTERED THE NEW FRIENDS AND FOES I ENCOUNTERED ON THE ROAD
6269-66185-0001 AND WHAT I DID AND WHAT I DID NOT ARE MATTERS THAT DO NOT COME WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THESE PAGES BUT BEFORE I WRITE FINIS TO THE RECORD AS IT STANDS
6269-66185-0002 AS IF I WERE ONCE MORE GOING AWAY FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAVE A WORD OR TWO TO SAY CONCERNING A FEW OF THE PERSONAGES WHO HAVE FIGURED IN THE STORY IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO CALL GYPSY A PERSONAGE
6269-66185-0003 I AM SURE THAT THE READER WHO HAS FOLLOWED ME THUS FAR WILL BE WILLING TO HEAR WHAT BECAME OF HER AND SAILOR BEN AND MISS ABIGAIL AND THE CAPTAIN FIRST ABOUT GYPSY
6269-66185-0004 A MONTH AFTER MY DEPARTURE FROM RIVERMOUTH THE CAPTAIN INFORMED ME BY LETTER THAT HE HAD PARTED WITH THE LITTLE MARE ACCORDING TO AGREEMENT SHE HAD BEEN SOLD TO THE RING MASTER OF A TRAVELLING CIRCUS
6269-66185-0005 I HAD STIPULATED ON THIS DISPOSAL OF HER AND WAS ABOUT TO SET OUT ON HER TRAVELS SHE DID NOT DISAPPOINT MY GLOWING ANTICIPATIONS BUT BECAME QUITE A CELEBRITY IN HER WAY BY DANCING THE POLKA TO SLOW MUSIC
6269-66185-0006 ON A PINE BOARD BALL ROOM CONSTRUCTED FOR THE PURPOSE I CHANCED ONCE A LONG WHILE AFTERWARDS TO BE IN A COUNTRY TOWN WHERE HER TROUPE WAS GIVING EXHIBITIONS
6269-66185-0007 OF ZULEIKA THE FAMED ARABIAN TRICK PONY BUT I FAILED TO RECOGNIZE MY DEAR LITTLE MUSTANG GIRL BEHIND THOSE HIGH SOUNDING TITLES AND SO ALAS DID NOT ATTEND THE PERFORMANCE
6269-66185-0008 I HOPE ALL THE PRAISES SHE RECEIVED AND ALL THE SPANGLED TRAPPINGS SHE WORE DID NOT SPOIL HER BUT I AM AFRAID THEY DID FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS OVER MUCH GIVEN TO THE VANITIES OF THIS WORLD
6269-66185-0009 MISS ABIGAIL REGULATED THE DOMESTIC DESTINIES OF MY GRANDFATHER'S HOUSEHOLD UNTIL THE DAY OF HER DEATH WHICH DOCTOR THEOPHILUS TREDICK SOLEMNLY AVERRED WAS HASTENED
6269-66185-0010 BY THE INVETERATE HABIT SHE HAD CONTRACTED OF SWALLOWING UNKNOWN QUANTITIES OF HOT DROPS WHENEVER SHE FANCIED HERSELF OUT OF SORTS EIGHTY SEVEN EMPTY PHIALS WERE FOUND IN A BONNET BOX ON A SHELF IN HER BEDROOM CLOSET
6269-66185-0011 THE OLD HOUSE BECAME VERY LONELY WHEN THE FAMILY GOT REDUCED TO CAPTAIN NUTTER AND KITTY AND WHEN KITTY PASSED AWAY MY GRANDFATHER DIVIDED HIS TIME BETWEEN RIVERMOUTH AND NEW YORK
6269-66185-0012 SAILOR BEN DID NOT LONG SURVIVE HIS LITTLE IRISH LASS AS HE ALWAYS FONDLY CALLED HER AT HIS DEMISE WHICH TOOK PLACE ABOUT SIX YEARS SINCE HE LEFT HIS PROPERTY IN TRUST TO THE MANAGERS
6269-66185-0013 OF A HOME FOR AGED MARINERS IN HIS WILL WHICH WAS A VERY WHIMSICAL DOCUMENT WRITTEN BY HIMSELF AND WORDED WITH MUCH SHREWDNESS TOO HE WARNED THE TRUSTEES THAT WHEN HE GOT ALOFT
6269-66185-0014 HE INTENDED TO KEEP HIS WEATHER EYE ON THEM AND SHOULD SEND A SPERITUAL SHOT ACROSS THEIR BOWS AND BRING THEM TO IF THEY DIDN'T TREAT THE AGED MARINERS HANDSOMELY HE ALSO EXPRESSED A WISH TO HAVE HIS BODY STITCHED UP
6269-66185-0015 IN A SHOTTED HAMMOCK AND DROPPED INTO THE HARBOR BUT AS HE DID NOT STRENUOUSLY INSIST ON THIS AND AS IT WAS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH MY GRANDFATHER'S PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS OF CHRISTIAN BURIAL
6269-66185-0016 THE ADMIRAL WAS LAID TO REST BESIDE KITTY IN THE OLD SOUTH BURYING GROUND WITH AN ANCHOR THAT WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED HIM NEATLY CARVED ON HIS HEADSTONE I AM SORRY THE FIRE HAS GONE OUT
6269-66185-0017 FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER LEAVING RIVERMOUTH I CARRIED ON A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH PEPPER WHITCOMB BUT IT GRADUALLY DWINDLED DOWN TO A SINGLE LETTER A MONTH AND THEN TO NONE AT ALL
6269-66185-0018 HE KEPT ME ADVISED OF THE CURRENT GOSSIP OF THE TOWN AND THE DOINGS OF THE CENTIPEDES AS ONE BY ONE THE BOYS LEFT THE ACADEMY ADAMS HARRIS MARDEN BLAKE AND LANGDON TO SEEK THEIR FORTUNES ELSEWHERE
6269-66185-0019 THERE WAS LESS TO INTEREST ME IN THE OLD SEAPORT AND WHEN PEPPER HIMSELF WENT TO PHILADELPHIA TO READ LAW I HAD NO ONE TO GIVE ME AN INKLING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE WASN'T MUCH TO GO ON TO BE SURE
6269-66185-0020 GREAT EVENTS NO LONGER CONSIDERED IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO HONOR SO QUIET A PLACE ONE FOURTH OF JULY THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL BURNT DOWN SET ON FIRE IT WAS SUPPOSED BY AN ECCENTRIC SQUIB
6269-66185-0021 THAT WAS SEEN TO BOLT INTO AN UPPER WINDOW AND MISTER GRIMSHAW RETIRED FROM PUBLIC LIFE MARRIED AND LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER AS THE STORY BOOKS SAY
6269-66185-0022 THE WIDOW CONWAY I AM ABLE TO STATE DID NOT SUCCEED IN ENSLAVING MISTER MEEKS THE APOTHECARY WHO UNITED HIMSELF CLANDESTINELY TO ONE OF MISS DOROTHY GIBBS'S YOUNG LADIES AND LOST THE PATRONAGE
6269-66185-0023 AND HAD HALF A MIND TO POP INTO THE SHOP AND SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM AND ASK HIM IF HE WANTED TO FIGHT I CONTENTED MYSELF HOWEVER WITH FLATTENING MY NOSE AGAINST HIS DINGY SHOP WINDOW AND BEHELD CONWAY IN RED WHISKERS AND BLUE OVERALLS
6269-66185-0024 GIVING HIM SHORT WEIGHT I'LL BET ANYTHING I HAVE RESERVED MY PLEASANTEST WORD FOR THE LAST IT IS TOUCHING THE CAPTAIN THE CAPTAIN IS STILL HALE AND ROSY AND IF HE DOESN'T RELATE HIS EXPLOIT
6269-66185-0025 IN THE WAR OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE AS SPIRITEDLY AS HE USED TO HE MAKES UP BY RELATING IT MORE FREQUENTLY AND TELLING IT DIFFERENTLY EVERY TIME HE PASSES HIS WINTERS IN NEW YORK
6269-66185-0026 AND HIS SUMMERS IN THE NUTTER HOUSE WHICH THREATENS TO PROVE A HARD NUT FOR THE DESTRUCTIVE GENTLEMAN WITH THE SCYTHE AND THE HOUR GLASS FOR THE SEAWARD GABLE HAS NOT YIELDED A CLAPBOARD TO THE EASTWIND THESE TWENTY YEARS
6269-66185-0027 THE CAPTAIN HAS NOW BECOME THE OLDEST INHABITANT IN RIVERMOUTH AND SO I DON'T LAUGH AT THE OLDEST INHABITANT ANY MORE BUT PRAY IN MY HEART THAT HE MAY OCCUPY THE POST OF HONOR FOR HALF A CENTURY TO COME
6269-66185-0028 SO ENDS THE STORY OF A BAD BOY
